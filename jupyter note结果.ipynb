There are nearer\\napproaches to modern metaphysics in the Philebus and in the Sophist;\\nthe Politicus or Statesman is more ideal; the form and institutions of\\nthe State are more clearly drawn out in the Laws; as works of art, the\\nSymposium and the Protagoras are of higher excellence. But no other\\nDialogue of Plato has the same largeness of view and the same\\nperfection of style; no other shows an equal knowledge of the world, or\\ncontains more of those thoughts which are new as well as old, and not\\nof one age only but of all. Nowhere in Plato is there a deeper irony or\\na greater wealth of humour or imagery, or more dramatic power. Nor in\\nany other of his writings is the attempt made to interweave life and\\nspeculation, or to connect politics with philosophy. The Republic is\\nthe centre around which the other Dialogues may be grouped; here\\nphilosophy reaches the highest point (cp, especially in Books V, VI,\\nVII) to which ancient thinkers ever attained. Plato among the Greeks,\\nlike Bacon among the moderns, was the first who conceived a method of\\nknowledge, although neither of them always distinguished the bare\\noutline or form from the substance of truth; and both of them had to be\\ncontent with an abstraction of science which was not yet realized. He\\nwas the greatest metaphysical genius whom the world has seen; and in\\nhim, more than in any other ancient thinker, the germs of future\\nknowledge are contained. The sciences of logic and psychology, which\\nhave supplied so many instruments of thought to after-ages, are based\\nupon the analyses of Socrates and Plato. The principles of definition,\\nthe law of contradiction, the fallacy of arguing in a circle, the\\ndistinction between the essence and accidents of a thing or notion,\\nbetween means and ends, between causes and conditions; also the\\ndivision of the mind into the rational, concupiscent, and irascible\\nelements, or of pleasures and desires into necessary and\\nunnecessary—these and other great forms of thought are all of them to\\nbe found in the Republic, and were probably first invented by Plato.\\nThe greatest of all logical truths, and the one of which writers on\\nphilosophy are most apt to lose sight, the difference between words and\\nthings, has been most strenuously insisted on by him (cp. Rep.; Polit.;\\nCratyl. 435, 436 ff), although he has not always avoided the confusion\\nof them in his own writings (e.g. Rep.). But he does not bind up truth\\nin logical formulae,—logic is still veiled in metaphysics; and the\\nscience which he imagines to ‘contemplate all truth and all existence’\\nis very unlike the doctrine of the syllogism which Aristotle claims to\\nhave discovered (Soph. Elenchi, 33. 18).\\n\\nNeither must we forget that the Republic is but the third part of a\\nstill larger design which was to have included an ideal history of\\nAthens, as well as a political and physical philosophy. The fragment of\\nthe Critias has given birth to a world-famous fiction, second only in\\nimportance to the tale of Troy and the legend of Arthur; and is said as\\na fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of the sixteenth\\ncentury. This mythical tale, of which the subject was a history of the\\nwars of the Athenians against the Island of Atlantis, is supposed to be\\nfounded upon an unfinished poem of Solon, to which it would have stood\\nin the same relation as the writings of the logographers to the poems\\nof Homer. It would have told of a struggle for Liberty (cp. Tim. 25 C),\\nintended to represent the conflict of Persia and Hellas. We may judge\\nfrom the noble commencement of the Timaeus, from the fragment of the\\nCritias itself, and from the third book of the Laws, in what manner\\nPlato would have treated this high argument. We can only guess why the\\ngreat design was abandoned; perhaps because Plato became sensible of\\nsome incongruity in a fictitious history, or because he had lost his\\ninterest in it, or because advancing years forbade the completion of\\nit; and we may please ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary\\nnarrative ever been finished, we should have found Plato himself\\nsympathising with the struggle for Hellenic independence (cp. Laws,\\niii. 698 ff.), singing a hymn of triumph over Marathon and Salamis,\\nperhaps making the reflection of Herodotus (v. 78) where he\\ncontemplates the growth of the Athenian empire—‘How brave a thing is\\nfreedom of speech, which has made the Athenians so far exceed every\\nother state of Hellas in greatness!’ or, more probably, attributing the\\nvictory to the ancient good order of Athens and to the favor of Apollo\\nand Athene (cp. Introd. to Critias).\\n\\nAgain, Plato may be regarded as the ‘captain’ (‘arhchegoz’) or leader\\nof a goodly band of followers; for in the Republic is to be found the\\noriginal of Cicero’s De Republica, of St. Augustine’s City of God, of\\nthe Utopia of Sir Thomas More, and of the numerous other imaginary\\nStates which are framed upon the same model. The extent to which\\nAristotle or the Aristotelian school were indebted to him in the\\nPolitics has been little recognised, and the recognition is the more\\nnecessary because it is not made by Aristotle himself. The two\\nphilosophers had more in common than they were conscious of; and\\nprobably some elements of Plato remain still undetected in Aristotle.\\nIn English philosophy too, many affinities may be traced, not only in\\nthe works of the Cambridge Platonists, but in great original writers\\nlike Berkeley or Coleridge, to Plato and his ideas. That there is a\\ntruth higher than experience, of which the mind bears witness to\\nherself, is a conviction which in our own generation has been\\nenthusiastically asserted, and is perhaps gaining ground. Of the Greek\\nauthors who at the Renaissance brought a new life into the world Plato\\nhas had the greatest influence. The Republic of Plato is also the first\\ntreatise upon education, of which the writings of Milton and Locke,\\nRousseau, Jean Paul, and Goethe are the legitimate descendants. Like\\nDante or Bunyan, he has a revelation of another life; like Bacon, he is\\nprofoundly impressed with the unity of knowledge; in the early Church\\nhe exercised a real influence on theology, and at the Revival of\\nLiterature on politics. Even the fragments of his words when ‘repeated\\nat second-hand’ (Symp. 215 D) have in all ages ravished the hearts of\\nmen, who have seen reflected in them their own higher nature. He is the\\nfather of idealism in philosophy, in politics, in literature. And many\\nof the latest conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen, such as the\\nunity of knowledge, the reign of law, and the equality of the sexes,\\nhave been anticipated in a dream by him.\\n\\nThe argument of the Republic is the search after Justice, the nature of\\nwhich is first hinted at by Cephalus, the just and blameless old\\nman—then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by Socrates and\\nPolemarchus—then caricatured by Thrasymachus and partially explained by\\nSocrates—reduced to an abstraction by Glaucon and Adeimantus, and\\nhaving become invisible in the individual reappears at length in the\\nideal State which is constructed by Socrates. The first care of the\\nrulers is to be education, of which an outline is drawn after the old\\nHellenic model, providing only for an improved religion and morality,\\nand more simplicity in music and gymnastic, a manlier strain of poetry,\\nand greater harmony of the individual and the State. We are thus led on\\nto the conception of a higher State, in which ‘no man calls anything\\nhis own,’ and in which there is neither ‘marrying nor giving in\\nmarriage,’ and ‘kings are philosophers’ and ‘philosophers are kings;’\\nand there is another and higher education, intellectual as well as\\nmoral and religious, of science as well as of art, and not of youth\\nonly but of the whole of life. Such a State is hardly to be realized in\\nthis world and quickly degenerates. To the perfect ideal succeeds the\\ngovernment of the soldier and the lover of honour, this again declining\\ninto democracy, and democracy into tyranny, in an imaginary but regular\\norder having not much resemblance to the actual facts. When ‘the wheel\\nhas come full circle’ we do not begin again with a new period of human\\nlife; but we have passed from the best to the worst, and there we end.\\nThe subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry and\\nphilosophy which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books of\\nthe Republic is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion. Poetry is\\ndiscovered to be an imitation thrice removed from the truth, and Homer,\\nas well as the dramatic poets, having been condemned as an imitator, is\\nsent into banishment along with them. And the idea of the State is\\nsupplemented by the revelation of a future life.\\n\\nThe division into books, like all similar divisions (Cp. Sir G.C. Lewis\\nin the Classical Museum, vol. ii. p 1.), is probably later than the age\\nof Plato. The natural divisions are five in number;—(1) Book I and the\\nfirst half of Book II down to the paragraph beginning, ‘I had always\\nadmired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus,’ which is introductory;\\nthe first book containing a refutation of the popular and sophistical\\nnotions of justice, and concluding, like some of the earlier Dialogues,\\nwithout arriving at any definite result. To this is appended a\\nrestatement of the nature of justice according to common opinion, and\\nan answer is demanded to the question—What is justice, stripped of\\nappearances? The second division (2) includes the remainder of the\\nsecond and the whole of the third and fourth books, which are mainly\\noccupied with the construction of the first State and the first\\neducation. The third division (3) consists of the fifth, sixth, and\\nseventh books, in which philosophy rather than justice is the subject\\nof enquiry, and the second State is constructed on principles of\\ncommunism and ruled by philosophers, and the contemplation of the idea\\nof good takes the place of the social and political virtues. In the\\neighth and ninth books (4) the perversions of States and of the\\nindividuals who correspond to them are reviewed in succession; and the\\nnature of pleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analysed in\\nthe individual man. The tenth book (5) is the conclusion of the whole,\\nin which the relations of philosophy to poetry are finally determined,\\nand the happiness of the citizens in this life, which has now been\\nassured, is crowned by the vision of another.\\n\\nOr a more general division into two parts may be adopted; the first\\n(Books I - IV) containing the description of a State framed generally\\nin accordance with Hellenic notions of religion and morality, while in\\nthe second (Books V - X) the Hellenic State is transformed into an\\nideal kingdom of philosophy, of which all other governments are the\\nperversions. These two points of view are really opposed, and the\\nopposition is only veiled by the genius of Plato. The Republic, like\\nthe Phaedrus (see Introduction to Phaedrus), is an imperfect whole; the\\nhigher light of philosophy breaks through the regularity of the\\nHellenic temple, which at last fades away into the heavens. Whether\\nthis imperfection of structure arises from an enlargement of the plan;\\nor from the imperfect reconcilement in the writer’s own mind of the\\nstruggling elements of thought which are now first brought together by\\nhim; or, perhaps, from the composition of the work at different\\ntimes—are questions, like the similar question about the Iliad and the\\nOdyssey, which are worth asking, but which cannot have a distinct\\nanswer. In the age of Plato there was no regular mode of publication,\\nand an author would have the less scruple in altering or adding to a\\nwork which was known only to a few of his friends. There is no\\nabsurdity in supposing that he may have laid his labours aside for a\\ntime, or turned from one work to another; and such interruptions would\\nbe more likely to occur in the case of a long than of a short writing.\\nIn all attempts to determine the chronological order of the Platonic\\nwritings on internal evidence, this uncertainty about any single\\nDialogue being composed at one time is a disturbing element, which must\\nbe admitted to affect longer works, such as the Republic and the Laws,\\nmore than shorter ones. But, on the other hand, the seeming\\ndiscrepancies of the Republic may only arise out of the discordant\\nelements which the philosopher has attempted to unite in a single\\nwhole, perhaps without being himself able to recognise the\\ninconsistency which is obvious to us. For there is a judgment of after\\nages which few great writers have ever been able to anticipate for\\nthemselves. They do not perceive the want of connexion in their own\\nwritings, or the gaps in their systems which are visible enough to\\nthose who come after them. In the beginnings of literature and\\nphilosophy, amid the first efforts of thought and language, more\\ninconsistencies occur than now, when the paths of speculation are well\\nworn and the meaning of words precisely defined. For consistency, too,\\nis the growth of time; and some of the greatest creations of the human\\nmind have been wanting in unity. Tried by this test, several of the\\nPlatonic Dialogues, according to our modern ideas, appear to be\\ndefective, but the deficiency is no proof that they were composed at\\ndifferent times or by different hands. And the supposition that the\\nRepublic was written uninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in\\nsome degree confirmed by the numerous references from one part of the\\nwork to another.\\n\\nThe second title, ‘Concerning Justice,’ is not the one by which the\\nRepublic is quoted, either by Aristotle or generally in antiquity, and,\\nlike the other second titles of the Platonic Dialogues, may therefore\\nbe assumed to be of later date. Morgenstern and others have asked\\nwhether the definition of justice, which is the professed aim, or the\\nconstruction of the State is the principal argument of the work. The\\nanswer is, that the two blend in one, and are two faces of the same\\ntruth; for justice is the order of the State, and the State is the\\nvisible embodiment of justice under the conditions of human society.\\nThe one is the soul and the other is the body, and the Greek ideal of\\nthe State, as of the individual, is a fair mind in a fair body. In\\nHegelian phraseology the state is the reality of which justice is the\\nidea. Or, described in Christian language, the kingdom of God is\\nwithin, and yet developes into a Church or external kingdom; ‘the house\\nnot made with hands, eternal in the heavens,’ is reduced to the\\nproportions of an earthly building. Or, to use a Platonic image,\\njustice and the State are the warp and the woof which run through the\\nwhole texture. And when the constitution of the State is completed, the\\nconception of justice is not dismissed, but reappears under the same or\\ndifferent names throughout the work, both as the inner law of the\\nindividual soul, and finally as the principle of rewards and\\npunishments in another life. The virtues are based on justice, of which\\ncommon honesty in buying and selling is the shadow, and justice is\\nbased on the idea of good, which is the harmony of the world, and is\\nreflected both in the institutions of states and in motions of the\\nheavenly bodies (cp. Tim. 47). The Timaeus, which takes up the\\npolitical rather than the ethical side of the Republic, and is chiefly\\noccupied with hypotheses concerning the outward world, yet contains\\nmany indications that the same law is supposed to reign over the State,\\nover nature, and over man.\\n\\nToo much, however, has been made of this question both in ancient and\\nmodern times. There is a stage of criticism in which all works, whether\\nof nature or of art, are referred to design. Now in ancient writings,\\nand indeed in literature generally, there remains often a large element\\nwhich was not comprehended in the original design. For the plan grows\\nunder the author’s hand; new thoughts occur to him in the act of\\nwriting; he has not worked out the argument to the end before he\\nbegins. The reader who seeks to find some one idea under which the\\nwhole may be conceived, must necessarily seize on the vaguest and most\\ngeneral. Thus Stallbaum, who is dissatisfied with the ordinary\\nexplanations of the argument of the Republic, imagines himself to have\\nfound the true argument ‘in the representation of human life in a State\\nperfected by justice, and governed according to the idea of good.’\\nThere may be some use in such general descriptions, but they can hardly\\nbe said to express the design of the writer. The truth is, that we may\\nas well speak of many designs as of one; nor need anything be excluded\\nfrom the plan of a great work to which the mind is naturally led by the\\nassociation of ideas, and which does not interfere with the general\\npurpose. What kind or degree of unity is to be sought after in a\\nbuilding, in the plastic arts, in poetry, in prose, is a problem which\\nhas to be determined relatively to the subject-matter. To Plato\\nhimself, the enquiry ‘what was the intention of the writer,’ or ‘what\\nwas the principal argument of the Republic’ would have been hardly\\nintelligible, and therefore had better be at once dismissed (cp. the\\nIntroduction to the Phaedrus).\\n\\nIs not the Republic the vehicle of three or four great truths which, to\\nPlato’s own mind, are most naturally represented in the form of the\\nState? Just as in the Jewish prophets the reign of Messiah, or ‘the day\\nof the Lord,’ or the suffering Servant or people of God, or the ‘Sun of\\nrighteousness with healing in his wings’ only convey, to us at least,\\ntheir great spiritual ideals, so through the Greek State Plato reveals\\nto us his own thoughts about divine perfection, which is the idea of\\ngood—like the sun in the visible world;—about human perfection, which\\nis justice—about education beginning in youth and continuing in later\\nyears—about poets and sophists and tyrants who are the false teachers\\nand evil rulers of mankind—about ‘the world’ which is the embodiment of\\nthem—about a kingdom which exists nowhere upon earth but is laid up in\\nheaven to be the pattern and rule of human life. No such inspired\\ncreation is at unity with itself, any more than the clouds of heaven\\nwhen the sun pierces through them. Every shade of light and dark, of\\ntruth, and of fiction which is the veil of truth, is allowable in a\\nwork of philosophical imagination. It is not all on the same plane; it\\neasily passes from ideas to myths and fancies, from facts to figures of\\nspeech. It is not prose but poetry, at least a great part of it, and\\nought not to be judged by the rules of logic or the probabilities of\\nhistory. The writer is not fashioning his ideas into an artistic whole;\\nthey take possession of him and are too much for him. We have no need\\ntherefore to discuss whether a State such as Plato has conceived is\\npracticable or not, or whether the outward form or the inward life came\\nfirst into the mind of the writer. For the practicability of his ideas\\nhas nothing to do with their truth; and the highest thoughts to which\\nhe attains may be truly said to bear the greatest ‘marks of\\ndesign’—justice more than the external frame-work of the State, the\\nidea of good more than justice. The great science of dialectic or the\\norganisation of ideas has no real content; but is only a type of the\\nmethod or spirit in which the higher knowledge is to be pursued by the\\nspectator of all time and all existence. It is in the fifth, sixth, and\\nseventh books that Plato reaches the ‘summit of speculation,’ and\\nthese, although they fail to satisfy the requirements of a modern\\nthinker, may therefore be regarded as the most important, as they are\\nalso the most original, portions of the work.\\n\\nIt is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question which has\\nbeen raised by Boeckh, respecting the imaginary date at which the\\nconversation was held (the year 411 B.C. which is proposed by him will\\ndo as well as any other); for a writer of fiction, and especially a\\nwriter who, like Plato, is notoriously careless of chronology (cp.\\nRep., Symp., 193 A, etc.), only aims at general probability. Whether\\nall the persons mentioned in the Republic could ever have met at any\\none time is not a difficulty which would have occurred to an Athenian\\nreading the work forty years later, or to Plato himself at the time of\\nwriting (any more than to Shakespeare respecting one of his own\\ndramas); and need not greatly trouble us now. Yet this may be a\\nquestion having no answer ‘which is still worth asking,’ because the\\ninvestigation shows that we cannot argue historically from the dates in\\nPlato; it would be useless therefore to waste time in inventing\\nfar-fetched reconcilements of them in order to avoid chronological\\ndifficulties, such, for example, as the conjecture of C.F. Hermann,\\nthat Glaucon and Adeimantus are not the brothers but the uncles of\\nPlato (cp. Apol. 34 A), or the fancy of Stallbaum that Plato\\nintentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates at which some of\\nhis Dialogues were written.\\n\\nThe principal characters in the Republic are Cephalus, Polemarchus,\\nThrasymachus, Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus. Cephalus appears in\\nthe introduction only, Polemarchus drops at the end of the first\\nargument, and Thrasymachus is reduced to silence at the close of the\\nfirst book. The main discussion is carried on by Socrates, Glaucon, and\\nAdeimantus. Among the company are Lysias (the orator) and Euthydemus,\\nthe sons of Cephalus and brothers of Polemarchus, an unknown\\nCharmantides—these are mute auditors; also there is Cleitophon, who\\nonce interrupts, where, as in the Dialogue which bears his name, he\\nappears as the friend and ally of Thrasymachus.\\n\\nCephalus, the patriarch of the house, has been appropriately engaged in\\noffering a sacrifice. He is the pattern of an old man who has almost\\ndone with life, and is at peace with himself and with all mankind. He\\nfeels that he is drawing nearer to the world below, and seems to linger\\naround the memory of the past. He is eager that Socrates should come to\\nvisit him, fond of the poetry of the last generation, happy in the\\nconsciousness of a well-spent life, glad at having escaped from the\\ntyranny of youthful lusts. His love of conversation, his affection, his\\nindifference to riches, even his garrulity, are interesting traits of\\ncharacter. He is not one of those who have nothing to say, because\\ntheir whole mind has been absorbed in making money. Yet he acknowledges\\nthat riches have the advantage of placing men above the temptation to\\ndishonesty or falsehood. The respectful attention shown to him by\\nSocrates, whose love of conversation, no less than the mission imposed\\nupon him by the Oracle, leads him to ask questions of all men, young\\nand old alike, should also be noted. Who better suited to raise the\\nquestion of justice than Cephalus, whose life might seem to be the\\nexpression of it? The moderation with which old age is pictured by\\nCephalus as a very tolerable portion of existence is characteristic,\\nnot only of him, but of Greek feeling generally, and contrasts with the\\nexaggeration of Cicero in the De Senectute. The evening of life is\\ndescribed by Plato in the most expressive manner, yet with the fewest\\npossible touches. As Cicero remarks (Ep. ad Attic. iv. 16), the aged\\nCephalus would have been out of place in the discussion which follows,\\nand which he could neither have understood nor taken part in without a\\nviolation of dramatic propriety (cp. Lysimachus in the Laches).\\n\\nHis ‘son and heir’ Polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousness of\\nyouth; he is for detaining Socrates by force in the opening scene, and\\nwill not ‘let him off’ on the subject of women and children. Like\\nCephalus, he is limited in his point of view, and represents the\\nproverbial stage of morality which has rules of life rather than\\nprinciples; and he quotes Simonides (cp. Aristoph. Clouds) as his\\nfather had quoted Pindar. But after this he has no more to say; the\\nanswers which he makes are only elicited from him by the dialectic of\\nSocrates. He has not yet experienced the influence of the Sophists like\\nGlaucon and Adeimantus, nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting\\nthem; he belongs to the pre-Socratic or pre-dialectical age. He is\\nincapable of arguing, and is bewildered by Socrates to such a degree\\nthat he does not know what he is saying. He is made to admit that\\njustice is a thief, and that the virtues follow the analogy of the\\narts. From his brother Lysias (contra Eratosth.) we learn that he fell\\na victim to the Thirty Tyrants, but no allusion is here made to his\\nfate, nor to the circumstance that Cephalus and his family were of\\nSyracusan origin, and had migrated from Thurii to Athens.\\n\\nThe ‘Chalcedonian giant,’ Thrasymachus, of whom we have already heard\\nin the Phaedrus, is the personification of the Sophists, according to\\nPlato’s conception of them, in some of their worst characteristics. He\\nis vain and blustering, refusing to discourse unless he is paid, fond\\nof making an oration, and hoping thereby to escape the inevitable\\nSocrates; but a mere child in argument, and unable to foresee that the\\nnext ‘move’ (to use a Platonic expression) will ‘shut him up.’ He has\\nreached the stage of framing general notions, and in this respect is in\\nadvance of Cephalus and Polemarchus. But he is incapable of defending\\nthem in a discussion, and vainly tries to cover his confusion with\\nbanter and insolence. Whether such doctrines as are attributed to him\\nby Plato were really held either by him or by any other Sophist is\\nuncertain; in the infancy of philosophy serious errors about morality\\nmight easily grow up—they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers\\nin Thucydides; but we are concerned at present with Plato’s description\\nof him, and not with the historical reality. The inequality of the\\ncontest adds greatly to the humour of the scene. The pompous and empty\\nSophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great master of\\ndialectic, who knows how to touch all the springs of vanity and\\nweakness in him. He is greatly irritated by the irony of Socrates, but\\nhis noisy and imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to the\\nthrusts of his assailant. His determination to cram down their throats,\\nor put ‘bodily into their souls’ his own words, elicits a cry of horror\\nfrom Socrates. The state of his temper is quite as worthy of remark as\\nthe process of the argument. Nothing is more amusing than his complete\\nsubmission when he has been once thoroughly beaten. At first he seems\\nto continue the discussion with reluctance, but soon with apparent\\ngood-will, and he even testifies his interest at a later stage by one\\nor two occasional remarks. When attacked by Glaucon he is humorously\\nprotected by Socrates ‘as one who has never been his enemy and is now\\nhis friend.’ From Cicero and Quintilian and from Aristotle’s Rhetoric\\nwe learn that the Sophist whom Plato has made so ridiculous was a man\\nof note whose writings were preserved in later ages. The play on his\\nname which was made by his contemporary Herodicus (Aris. Rhet.), ‘thou\\nwast ever bold in battle,’ seems to show that the description of him is\\nnot devoid of verisimilitude.\\n\\nWhen Thrasymachus has been silenced, the two principal respondents,\\nGlaucon and Adeimantus, appear on the scene: here, as in Greek tragedy\\n(cp. Introd. to Phaedo), three actors are introduced. At first sight\\nthe two sons of Ariston may seem to wear a family likeness, like the\\ntwo friends Simmias and Cebes in the Phaedo. But on a nearer\\nexamination of them the similarity vanishes, and they are seen to be\\ndistinct characters. Glaucon is the impetuous youth who can ‘just never\\nhave enough of fechting’ (cp. the character of him in Xen. Mem. iii.\\n6); the man of pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries of love;\\nthe ‘juvenis qui gaudet canibus,’ and who improves the breed of\\nanimals; the lover of art and music who has all the experiences of\\nyouthful life. He is full of quickness and penetration, piercing easily\\nbelow the clumsy platitudes of Thrasymachus to the real difficulty; he\\nturns out to the light the seamy side of human life, and yet does not\\nlose faith in the just and true. It is Glaucon who seizes what may be\\ntermed the ludicrous relation of the philosopher to the world, to whom\\na state of simplicity is ‘a city of pigs,’ who is always prepared with\\na jest when the argument offers him an opportunity, and who is ever\\nready to second the humour of Socrates and to appreciate the\\nridiculous, whether in the connoisseurs of music, or in the lovers of\\ntheatricals, or in the fantastic behaviour of the citizens of\\ndemocracy. His weaknesses are several times alluded to by Socrates,\\nwho, however, will not allow him to be attacked by his brother\\nAdeimantus. He is a soldier, and, like Adeimantus, has been\\ndistinguished at the battle of Megara (anno 456?)...The character of\\nAdeimantus is deeper and graver, and the profounder objections are\\ncommonly put into his mouth. Glaucon is more demonstrative, and\\ngenerally opens the game. Adeimantus pursues the argument further.\\nGlaucon has more of the liveliness and quick sympathy of youth;\\nAdeimantus has the maturer judgment of a grown-up man of the world. In\\nthe second book, when Glaucon insists that justice and injustice shall\\nbe considered without regard to their consequences, Adeimantus remarks\\nthat they are regarded by mankind in general only for the sake of their\\nconsequences; and in a similar vein of reflection he urges at the\\nbeginning of the fourth book that Socrates fails in making his citizens\\nhappy, and is answered that happiness is not the first but the second\\nthing, not the direct aim but the indirect consequence of the good\\ngovernment of a State. In the discussion about religion and mythology,\\nAdeimantus is the respondent, but Glaucon breaks in with a slight jest,\\nand carries on the conversation in a lighter tone about music and\\ngymnastic to the end of the book. It is Adeimantus again who volunteers\\nthe criticism of common sense on the Socratic method of argument, and\\nwho refuses to let Socrates pass lightly over the question of women and\\nchildren. It is Adeimantus who is the respondent in the more\\nargumentative, as Glaucon in the lighter and more imaginative portions\\nof the Dialogue. For example, throughout the greater part of the sixth\\nbook, the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the conception of\\nthe idea of good are discussed with Adeimantus. Glaucon resumes his\\nplace of principal respondent; but he has a difficulty in apprehending\\nthe higher education of Socrates, and makes some false hits in the\\ncourse of the discussion. Once more Adeimantus returns with the\\nallusion to his brother Glaucon whom he compares to the contentious\\nState; in the next book he is again superseded, and Glaucon continues\\nto the end.\\n\\nThus in a succession of characters Plato represents the successive\\nstages of morality, beginning with the Athenian gentleman of the olden\\ntime, who is followed by the practical man of that day regulating his\\nlife by proverbs and saws; to him succeeds the wild generalization of\\nthe Sophists, and lastly come the young disciples of the great teacher,\\nwho know the sophistical arguments but will not be convinced by them,\\nand desire to go deeper into the nature of things. These too, like\\nCephalus, Polemarchus, Thrasymachus, are clearly distinguished from one\\nanother. Neither in the Republic, nor in any other Dialogue of Plato,\\nis a single character repeated.\\n\\nThe delineation of Socrates in the Republic is not wholly consistent.\\nIn the first book we have more of the real Socrates, such as he is\\ndepicted in the Memorabilia of Xenophon, in the earliest Dialogues of\\nPlato, and in the Apology. He is ironical, provoking, questioning, the\\nold enemy of the Sophists, ready to put on the mask of Silenus as well\\nas to argue seriously. But in the sixth book his enmity towards the\\nSophists abates; he acknowledges that they are the representatives\\nrather than the corrupters of the world. He also becomes more dogmatic\\nand constructive, passing beyond the range either of the political or\\nthe speculative ideas of the real Socrates. In one passage Plato\\nhimself seems to intimate that the time had now come for Socrates, who\\nhad passed his whole life in philosophy, to give his own opinion and\\nnot to be always repeating the notions of other men. There is no\\nevidence that either the idea of good or the conception of a perfect\\nstate were comprehended in the Socratic teaching, though he certainly\\ndwelt on the nature of the universal and of final causes (cp. Xen.\\nMem.; Phaedo); and a deep thinker like him, in his thirty or forty\\nyears of public teaching, could hardly have failed to touch on the\\nnature of family relations, for which there is also some positive\\nevidence in the Memorabilia (Mem.) The Socratic method is nominally\\nretained; and every inference is either put into the mouth of the\\nrespondent or represented as the common discovery of him and Socrates.\\nBut any one can see that this is a mere form, of which the affectation\\ngrows wearisome as the work advances. The method of enquiry has passed\\ninto a method of teaching in which by the help of interlocutors the\\nsame thesis is looked at from various points of view. The nature of the\\nprocess is truly characterized by Glaucon, when he describes himself as\\na companion who is not good for much in an investigation, but can see\\nwhat he is shown, and may, perhaps, give the answer to a question more\\nfluently than another.\\n\\nNeither can we be absolutely certain that Socrates himself taught the\\nimmortality of the soul, which is unknown to his disciple Glaucon in\\nthe Republic (cp. Apol.); nor is there any reason to suppose that he\\nused myths or revelations of another world as a vehicle of instruction,\\nor that he would have banished poetry or have denounced the Greek\\nmythology. His favorite oath is retained, and a slight mention is made\\nof the daemonium, or internal sign, which is alluded to by Socrates as\\na phenomenon peculiar to himself. A real element of Socratic teaching,\\nwhich is more prominent in the Republic than in any of the other\\nDialogues of Plato, is the use of example and illustration τὰ φορτικὰ\\nαὐτῷ προσφέροντες, ‘Let us apply the test of common instances.’ ‘You,’\\nsays Adeimantus, ironically, in the sixth book, ‘are so unaccustomed to\\nspeak in images.’ And this use of examples or images, though truly\\nSocratic in origin, is enlarged by the genius of Plato into the form of\\nan allegory or parable, which embodies in the concrete what has been\\nalready described, or is about to be described, in the abstract. Thus\\nthe figure of the cave in Book VII is a recapitulation of the divisions\\nof knowledge in Book VI. The composite animal in Book IX is an allegory\\nof the parts of the soul. The noble captain and the ship and the true\\npilot in Book VI are a figure of the relation of the people to the\\nphilosophers in the State which has been described. Other figures, such\\nas the dog, or the marriage of the portionless maiden, or the drones\\nand wasps in the eighth and ninth books, also form links of connexion\\nin long passages, or are used to recall previous discussions.\\n\\nPlato is most true to the character of his master when he describes him\\nas ‘not of this world.’ And with this representation of him the ideal\\nstate and the other paradoxes of the Republic are quite in accordance,\\nthough they cannot be shown to have been speculations of Socrates. To\\nhim, as to other great teachers both philosophical and religious, when\\nthey looked upward, the world seemed to be the embodiment of error and\\nevil. The common sense of mankind has revolted against this view, or\\nhas only partially admitted it. And even in Socrates himself the\\nsterner judgement of the multitude at times passes into a sort of\\nironical pity or love. Men in general are incapable of philosophy, and\\nare therefore at enmity with the philosopher; but their\\nmisunderstanding of him is unavoidable: for they have never seen him as\\nhe truly is in his own image; they are only acquainted with artificial\\nsystems possessing no native force of truth—words which admit of many\\napplications. Their leaders have nothing to measure with, and are\\ntherefore ignorant of their own stature. But they are to be pitied or\\nlaughed at, not to be quarrelled with; they mean well with their\\nnostrums, if they could only learn that they are cutting off a Hydra’s\\nhead. This moderation towards those who are in error is one of the most\\ncharacteristic features of Socrates in the Republic. In all the\\ndifferent representations of Socrates, whether of Xenophon or Plato,\\nand amid the differences of the earlier or later Dialogues, he always\\nretains the character of the unwearied and disinterested seeker after\\ntruth, without which he would have ceased to be Socrates.\\n\\nLeaving the characters we may now analyse the contents of the Republic,\\nand then proceed to consider (1) The general aspects of this Hellenic\\nideal of the State, (2) The modern lights in which the thoughts of\\nPlato may be read.\\n\\nBOOK I. The Republic opens with a truly Greek scene—a festival in\\nhonour of the goddess Bendis which is held in the Piraeus; to this is\\nadded the promise of an equestrian torch-race in the evening. The whole\\nwork is supposed to be recited by Socrates on the day after the\\nfestival to a small party, consisting of Critias, Timaeus, Hermocrates,\\nand another; this we learn from the first words of the Timaeus.\\n\\nWhen the rhetorical advantage of reciting the Dialogue has been gained,\\nthe attention is not distracted by any reference to the audience; nor\\nis the reader further reminded of the extraordinary length of the\\nnarrative. Of the numerous company, three only take any serious part in\\nthe discussion; nor are we informed whether in the evening they went to\\nthe torch-race, or talked, as in the Symposium, through the night. The\\nmanner in which the conversation has arisen is described as\\nfollows:—Socrates and his companion Glaucon are about to leave the\\nfestival when they are detained by a message from Polemarchus, who\\nspeedily appears accompanied by Adeimantus, the brother of Glaucon, and\\nwith playful violence compels them to remain, promising them not only\\nthe torch-race, but the pleasure of conversation with the young, which\\nto Socrates is a far greater attraction. They return to the house of\\nCephalus, Polemarchus’ father, now in extreme old age, who is found\\nsitting upon a cushioned seat crowned for a sacrifice. ‘You should come\\nto me oftener, Socrates, for I am too old to go to you; and at my time\\nof life, having lost other pleasures, I care the more for\\nconversation.’ Socrates asks him what he thinks of age, to which the\\nold man replies, that the sorrows and discontents of age are to be\\nattributed to the tempers of men, and that age is a time of peace in\\nwhich the tyranny of the passions is no longer felt. Yes, replies\\nSocrates, but the world will say, Cephalus, that you are happy in old\\nage because you are rich. ‘And there is something in what they say,\\nSocrates, but not so much as they imagine—as Themistocles replied to\\nthe Seriphian, “Neither you, if you had been an Athenian, nor I, if I\\nhad been a Seriphian, would ever have been famous,” I might in like\\nmanner reply to you, Neither a good poor man can be happy in age, nor\\nyet a bad rich man.’ Socrates remarks that Cephalus appears not to care\\nabout riches, a quality which he ascribes to his having inherited, not\\nacquired them, and would like to know what he considers to be the chief\\nadvantage of them. Cephalus answers that when you are old the belief in\\nthe world below grows upon you, and then to have done justice and never\\nto have been compelled to do injustice through poverty, and never to\\nhave deceived anyone, are felt to be unspeakable blessings. Socrates,\\nwho is evidently preparing for an argument, next asks, What is the\\nmeaning of the word justice? To tell the truth and pay your debts? No\\nmore than this? Or must we admit exceptions? Ought I, for example, to\\nput back into the hands of my friend, who has gone mad, the sword which\\nI borrowed of him when he was in his right mind? ‘There must be\\nexceptions.’ ‘And yet,’ says Polemarchus, ‘the definition which has\\nbeen given has the authority of Simonides.’ Here Cephalus retires to\\nlook after the sacrifices, and bequeaths, as Socrates facetiously\\nremarks, the possession of the argument to his heir, Polemarchus...\\n\\nThe description of old age is finished, and Plato, as his manner is,\\nhas touched the key-note of the whole work in asking for the definition\\nof justice, first suggesting the question which Glaucon afterwards\\npursues respecting external goods, and preparing for the concluding\\nmythus of the world below in the slight allusion of Cephalus. The\\nportrait of the just man is a natural frontispiece or introduction to\\nthe long discourse which follows, and may perhaps imply that in all our\\nperplexity about the nature of justice, there is no difficulty in\\ndiscerning ‘who is a just man.’ The first explanation has been\\nsupported by a saying of Simonides; and now Socrates has a mind to show\\nthat the resolution of justice into two unconnected precepts, which\\nhave no common principle, fails to satisfy the demands of dialectic.\\n\\n...He proceeds: What did Simonides mean by this saying of his? Did he\\nmean that I was to give back arms to a madman? ‘No, not in that case,\\nnot if the parties are friends, and evil would result. He meant that\\nyou were to do what was proper, good to friends and harm to enemies.’\\nEvery act does something to somebody; and following this analogy,\\nSocrates asks, What is this due and proper thing which justice does,\\nand to whom? He is answered that justice does good to friends and harm\\nto enemies. But in what way good or harm? ‘In making alliances with the\\none, and going to war with the other.’ Then in time of peace what is\\nthe good of justice? The answer is that justice is of use in contracts,\\nand contracts are money partnerships. Yes; but how in such partnerships\\nis the just man of more use than any other man? ‘When you want to have\\nmoney safely kept and not used.’ Then justice will be useful when money\\nis useless. And there is another difficulty: justice, like the art of\\nwar or any other art, must be of opposites, good at attack as well as\\nat defence, at stealing as well as at guarding. But then justice is a\\nthief, though a hero notwithstanding, like Autolycus, the Homeric hero,\\nwho was ‘excellent above all men in theft and perjury’—to such a pass\\nhave you and Homer and Simonides brought us; though I do not forget\\nthat the thieving must be for the good of friends and the harm of\\nenemies. And still there arises another question: Are friends to be\\ninterpreted as real or seeming; enemies as real or seeming? And are our\\nfriends to be only the good, and our enemies to be the evil? The answer\\nis, that we must do good to our seeming and real good friends, and evil\\nto our seeming and real evil enemies—good to the good, evil to the\\nevil. But ought we to render evil for evil at all, when to do so will\\nonly make men more evil? Can justice produce injustice any more than\\nthe art of horsemanship can make bad horsemen, or heat produce cold?\\nThe final conclusion is, that no sage or poet ever said that the just\\nreturn evil for evil; this was a maxim of some rich and mighty man,\\nPeriander, Perdiccas, or Ismenias the Theban (about B.C. 398-381)...\\n\\nThus the first stage of aphoristic or unconscious morality is shown to\\nbe inadequate to the wants of the age; the authority of the poets is\\nset aside, and through the winding mazes of dialectic we make an\\napproach to the Christian precept of forgiveness of injuries. Similar\\nwords are applied by the Persian mystic poet to the Divine being when\\nthe questioning spirit is stirred within him:—‘If because I do evil,\\nThou punishest me by evil, what is the difference between Thee and me?’\\nIn this both Plato and Kheyam rise above the level of many Christian\\n(?) theologians. The first definition of justice easily passes into the\\nsecond; for the simple words ‘to speak the truth and pay your debts’ is\\nsubstituted the more abstract ‘to do good to your friends and harm to\\nyour enemies.’ Either of these explanations gives a sufficient rule of\\nlife for plain men, but they both fall short of the precision of\\nphilosophy. We may note in passing the antiquity of casuistry, which\\nnot only arises out of the conflict of established principles in\\nparticular cases, but also out of the effort to attain them, and is\\nprior as well as posterior to our fundamental notions of morality. The\\n‘interrogation’ of moral ideas; the appeal to the authority of Homer;\\nthe conclusion that the maxim, ‘Do good to your friends and harm to\\nyour enemies,’ being erroneous, could not have been the word of any\\ngreat man, are all of them very characteristic of the Platonic\\nSocrates.\\n\\n...Here Thrasymachus, who has made several attempts to interrupt, but\\nhas hitherto been kept in order by the company, takes advantage of a\\npause and rushes into the arena, beginning, like a savage animal, with\\na roar. ‘Socrates,’ he says, ‘what folly is this?—Why do you agree to\\nbe vanquished by one another in a pretended argument?’ He then\\nprohibits all the ordinary definitions of justice; to which Socrates\\nreplies that he cannot tell how many twelve is, if he is forbidden to\\nsay 2 x 6, or 3 x 4, or 6 x 2, or 4 x 3. At first Thrasymachus is\\nreluctant to argue; but at length, with a promise of payment on the\\npart of the company and of praise from Socrates, he is induced to open\\nthe game. ‘Listen,’ he says, ‘my answer is that might is right, justice\\nthe interest of the stronger: now praise me.’ Let me understand you\\nfirst. Do you mean that because Polydamas the wrestler, who is stronger\\nthan we are, finds the eating of beef for his interest, the eating of\\nbeef is also for our interest, who are not so strong? Thrasymachus is\\nindignant at the illustration, and in pompous words, apparently\\nintended to restore dignity to the argument, he explains his meaning to\\nbe that the rulers make laws for their own interests. But suppose, says\\nSocrates, that the ruler or stronger makes a mistake—then the interest\\nof the stronger is not his interest. Thrasymachus is saved from this\\nspeedy downfall by his disciple Cleitophon, who introduces the word\\n‘thinks;’—not the actual interest of the ruler, but what he thinks or\\nwhat seems to be his interest, is justice. The contradiction is escaped\\nby the unmeaning evasion: for though his real and apparent interests\\nmay differ, what the ruler thinks to be his interest will always remain\\nwhat he thinks to be his interest.\\n\\nOf course this was not the original assertion, nor is the new\\ninterpretation accepted by Thrasymachus himself. But Socrates is not\\ndisposed to quarrel about words, if, as he significantly insinuates,\\nhis adversary has changed his mind. In what follows Thrasymachus does\\nin fact withdraw his admission that the ruler may make a mistake, for\\nhe affirms that the ruler as a ruler is infallible. Socrates is quite\\nready to accept the new position, which he equally turns against\\nThrasymachus by the help of the analogy of the arts. Every art or\\nscience has an interest, but this interest is to be distinguished from\\nthe accidental interest of the artist, and is only concerned with the\\ngood of the things or persons which come under the art. And justice has\\nan interest which is the interest not of the ruler or judge, but of\\nthose who come under his sway.\\n\\nThrasymachus is on the brink of the inevitable conclusion, when he\\nmakes a bold diversion. ‘Tell me, Socrates,’ he says, ‘have you a\\nnurse?’ What a question! Why do you ask? ‘Because, if you have, she\\nneglects you and lets you go about drivelling, and has not even taught\\nyou to know the shepherd from the sheep. For you fancy that shepherds\\nand rulers never think of their own interest, but only of their sheep\\nor subjects, whereas the truth is that they fatten them for their use,\\nsheep and subjects alike. And experience proves that in every relation\\nof life the just man is the loser and the unjust the gainer, especially\\nwhere injustice is on the grand scale, which is quite another thing\\nfrom the petty rogueries of swindlers and burglars and robbers of\\ntemples. The language of men proves this—our ‘gracious’ and ‘blessed’\\ntyrant and the like—all which tends to show (1) that justice is the\\ninterest of the stronger; and (2) that injustice is more profitable and\\nalso stronger than justice.’\\n\\nThrasymachus, who is better at a speech than at a close argument,\\nhaving deluged the company with words, has a mind to escape. But the\\nothers will not let him go, and Socrates adds a humble but earnest\\nrequest that he will not desert them at such a crisis of their fate.\\n‘And what can I do more for you?’ he says; ‘would you have me put the\\nwords bodily into your souls?’ God forbid! replies Socrates; but we\\nwant you to be consistent in the use of terms, and not to employ\\n‘physician’ in an exact sense, and then again ‘shepherd’ or ‘ruler’ in\\nan inexact,—if the words are strictly taken, the ruler and the shepherd\\nlook only to the good of their people or flocks and not to their own:\\nwhereas you insist that rulers are solely actuated by love of office.\\n‘No doubt about it,’ replies Thrasymachus. Then why are they paid? Is\\nnot the reason, that their interest is not comprehended in their art,\\nand is therefore the concern of another art, the art of pay, which is\\ncommon to the arts in general, and therefore not identical with any one\\nof them? Nor would any man be a ruler unless he were induced by the\\nhope of reward or the fear of punishment;—the reward is money or\\nhonour, the punishment is the necessity of being ruled by a man worse\\nthan himself. And if a State (or Church) were composed entirely of good\\nmen, they would be affected by the last motive only; and there would be\\nas much ‘nolo episcopari’ as there is at present of the opposite...\\n\\nThe satire on existing governments is heightened by the simple and\\napparently incidental manner in which the last remark is introduced.\\nThere is a similar irony in the argument that the governors of mankind\\ndo not like being in office, and that therefore they demand pay.\\n\\n...Enough of this: the other assertion of Thrasymachus is far more\\nimportant—that the unjust life is more gainful than the just. Now, as\\nyou and I, Glaucon, are not convinced by him, we must reply to him; but\\nif we try to compare their respective gains we shall want a judge to\\ndecide for us; we had better therefore proceed by making mutual\\nadmissions of the truth to one another.\\n\\nThrasymachus had asserted that perfect injustice was more gainful than\\nperfect justice, and after a little hesitation he is induced by\\nSocrates to admit the still greater paradox that injustice is virtue\\nand justice vice. Socrates praises his frankness, and assumes the\\nattitude of one whose only wish is to understand the meaning of his\\nopponents. At the same time he is weaving a net in which Thrasymachus\\nis finally enclosed. The admission is elicited from him that the just\\nman seeks to gain an advantage over the unjust only, but not over the\\njust, while the unjust would gain an advantage over either. Socrates,\\nin order to test this statement, employs once more the favourite\\nanalogy of the arts. The musician, doctor, skilled artist of any sort,\\ndoes not seek to gain more than the skilled, but only more than the\\nunskilled (that is to say, he works up to a rule, standard, law, and\\ndoes not exceed it), whereas the unskilled makes random efforts at\\nexcess. Thus the skilled falls on the side of the good, and the\\nunskilled on the side of the evil, and the just is the skilled, and the\\nunjust is the unskilled.\\n\\nThere was great difficulty in bringing Thrasymachus to the point; the\\nday was hot and he was streaming with perspiration, and for the first\\ntime in his life he was seen to blush. But his other thesis that\\ninjustice was stronger than justice has not yet been refuted, and\\nSocrates now proceeds to the consideration of this, which, with the\\nassistance of Thrasymachus, he hopes to clear up; the latter is at\\nfirst churlish, but in the judicious hands of Socrates is soon restored\\nto good-humour: Is there not honour among thieves? Is not the strength\\nof injustice only a remnant of justice? Is not absolute injustice\\nabsolute weakness also? A house that is divided against itself cannot\\nstand; two men who quarrel detract from one another’s strength, and he\\nwho is at war with himself is the enemy of himself and the gods. Not\\nwickedness therefore, but semi-wickedness flourishes in states,—a\\nremnant of good is needed in order to make union in action\\npossible,—there is no kingdom of evil in this world.\\n\\nAnother question has not been answered: Is the just or the unjust the\\nhappier? To this we reply, that every art has an end and an excellence\\nor virtue by which the end is accomplished. And is not the end of the\\nsoul happiness, and justice the excellence of the soul by which\\nhappiness is attained? Justice and happiness being thus shown to be\\ninseparable, the question whether the just or the unjust is the happier\\nhas disappeared.\\n\\nThrasymachus replies: ‘Let this be your entertainment, Socrates, at the\\nfestival of Bendis.’ Yes; and a very good entertainment with which your\\nkindness has supplied me, now that you have left off scolding. And yet\\nnot a good entertainment—but that was my own fault, for I tasted of too\\nmany things. First of all the nature of justice was the subject of our\\nenquiry, and then whether justice is virtue and wisdom, or evil and\\nfolly; and then the comparative advantages of just and unjust: and the\\nsum of all is that I know not what justice is; how then shall I know\\nwhether the just is happy or not?...\\n\\nThus the sophistical fabric has been demolished, chiefly by appealing\\nto the analogy of the arts. ‘Justice is like the arts (1) in having no\\nexternal interest, and (2) in not aiming at excess, and (3) justice is\\nto happiness what the implement of the workman is to his work.’ At this\\nthe modern reader is apt to stumble, because he forgets that Plato is\\nwriting in an age when the arts and the virtues, like the moral and\\nintellectual faculties, were still undistinguished. Among early\\nenquirers into the nature of human action the arts helped to fill up\\nthe void of speculation; and at first the comparison of the arts and\\nthe virtues was not perceived by them to be fallacious. They only saw\\nthe points of agreement in them and not the points of difference.\\nVirtue, like art, must take means to an end; good manners are both an\\nart and a virtue; character is naturally described under the image of a\\nstatue; and there are many other figures of speech which are readily\\ntransferred from art to morals. The next generation cleared up these\\nperplexities; or at least supplied after ages with a further analysis\\nof them. The contemporaries of Plato were in a state of transition, and\\nhad not yet fully realized the common-sense distinction of Aristotle,\\nthat ‘virtue is concerned with action, art with production’ (Nic.\\nEth.), or that ‘virtue implies intention and constancy of purpose,’\\nwhereas ‘art requires knowledge only’. And yet in the absurdities which\\nfollow from some uses of the analogy, there seems to be an intimation\\nconveyed that virtue is more than art. This is implied in the reductio\\nad absurdum that ‘justice is a thief,’ and in the dissatisfaction which\\nSocrates expresses at the final result.\\n\\nThe expression ‘an art of pay’ which is described as ‘common to all the\\narts’ is not in accordance with the ordinary use of language. Nor is it\\nemployed elsewhere either by Plato or by any other Greek writer. It is\\nsuggested by the argument, and seems to extend the conception of art to\\ndoing as well as making. Another flaw or inaccuracy of language may be\\nnoted in the words ‘men who are injured are made more unjust.’ For\\nthose who are injured are not necessarily made worse, but only harmed\\nor illtreated.\\nThe second of the three arguments that the just does not aim at excess   has a real meaning, though wrapped up in an enigmatical form.\\nThat the good is of the nature of the finite is a peculiarly Hellenic\\nsentiment, which may be compared with the language of those modern\\nwriters who speak of virtue as fitness, and of freedom as obedience to\\nlaw. The mathematical or logical notion of limit easily passes into an\\nethical one, and even finds a mythological expression in the conception\\nof envy (Greek). Ideas of measure, equality, order, unity, proportion,\\nstill linger in the writings of moralists; and the true spirit of the\\nfine arts is better conveyed by such terms than by superlatives.\\n\\n‘When workmen strive to do better than well,\\nThey do confound their skill in covetousness.’ (King John. Act. iv. Sc.\\n2.)\\n\\n\\nThe harmony of the soul and body, and of the parts of the soul with one\\nanother, a harmony ‘fairer than that of musical notes,’ is the true\\nHellenic mode of conceiving the perfection of human nature.\\n\\nIn what may be called the epilogue of the discussion with Thrasymachus,\\nPlato argues that evil is not a principle of strength, but of discord\\nand dissolution, just touching the question which has been often\\ntreated in modern times by theologians and philosophers, of the\\nnegative nature of evil. In the last argument we trace the germ of the\\nAristotelian doctrine of an end and a virtue directed towards the end,\\nwhich again is suggested by the arts. The final reconcilement of\\njustice and happiness and the identity of the individual and the State\\nare also intimated. Socrates reassumes the character of a\\n‘know-nothing;’ at the same time he appears to be not wholly satisfied\\nwith the manner in which the argument has been conducted. Nothing is\\nconcluded; but the tendency of the dialectical process, here as always,\\nis to enlarge our conception of ideas, and to widen their application\\nto human life.\\n\\nBOOK II. Thrasymachus is pacified, but the intrepid Glaucon insists on\\ncontinuing the argument. He is not satisfied with the indirect manner\\nin which, at the end of the last book, Socrates had disposed of the\\nquestion ‘Whether the just or the unjust is the happier.’ He begins by\\ndividing goods into three classes:—first, goods desirable in\\nthemselves; secondly, goods desirable in themselves and for their\\nresults; thirdly, goods desirable for their results only. He then asks\\nSocrates in which of the three classes he would place justice. In the\\nsecond class, replies Socrates, among goods desirable for themselves\\nand also for their results. ‘Then the world in general are of another\\nmind, for they say that justice belongs to the troublesome class of\\ngoods which are desirable for their results only. Socrates answers that\\nthis is the doctrine of Thrasymachus which he rejects. Glaucon thinks\\nthat Thrasymachus was too ready to listen to the voice of the charmer,\\nand proposes to consider the nature of justice and injustice in\\nthemselves and apart from the results and rewards of them which the\\nworld is always dinning in his ears. He will first of all speak of the\\nnature and origin of justice; secondly, of the manner in which men view\\njustice as a necessity and not a good; and thirdly, he will prove the\\nreasonableness of this view.\\n\\n‘To do injustice is said to be a good; to suffer injustice an evil. As\\nthe evil is discovered by experience to be greater than the good, the\\nsufferers, who cannot also be doers, make a compact that they will have\\nneither, and this compact or mean is called justice, but is really the\\nimpossibility of doing injustice. No one would observe such a compact\\nif he were not obliged. Let us suppose that the just and unjust have\\ntwo rings, like that of Gyges in the well-known story, which make them\\ninvisible, and then no difference will appear in them, for every one\\nwill do evil if he can. And he who abstains will be regarded by the\\nworld as a fool for his pains. Men may praise him in public out of fear\\nfor themselves, but they will laugh at him in their hearts (Cp.\\nGorgias.)\\n\\n‘And now let us frame an ideal of the just and unjust. Imagine the\\nunjust man to be master of his craft, seldom making mistakes and easily\\ncorrecting them; having gifts of money, speech, strength—the greatest\\nvillain bearing the highest character: and at his side let us place the\\njust in his nobleness and simplicity—being, not seeming—without name or\\nreward—clothed in his justice only—the best of men who is thought to be\\nthe worst, and let him die as he has lived. I might add (but I would\\nrather put the rest into the mouth of the panegyrists of injustice—they\\nwill tell you) that the just man will be scourged, racked, bound, will\\nhave his eyes put out, and will at last be crucified (literally\\nimpaled)—and all this because he ought to have preferred seeming to\\nbeing. How different is the case of the unjust who clings to appearance\\nas the true reality! His high character makes him a ruler; he can marry\\nwhere he likes, trade where he likes, help his friends and hurt his\\nenemies; having got rich by dishonesty he can worship the gods better,\\nand will therefore be more loved by them than the just.’\\n\\nI was thinking what to answer, when Adeimantus joined in the already\\nunequal fray. He considered that the most important point of all had\\nbeen omitted:—‘Men are taught to be just for the sake of rewards;\\nparents and guardians make reputation the incentive to virtue. And\\nother advantages are promised by them of a more solid kind, such as\\nwealthy marriages and high offices. There are the pictures in Homer and\\nHesiod of fat sheep and heavy fleeces, rich corn-fields and trees\\ntoppling with fruit, which the gods provide in this life for the just.\\nAnd the Orphic poets add a similar picture of another. The heroes of\\nMusaeus and Eumolpus lie on couches at a festival, with garlands on\\ntheir heads, enjoying as the meed of virtue a paradise of immortal\\ndrunkenness. Some go further, and speak of a fair posterity in the\\nthird and fourth generation. But the wicked they bury in a slough and\\nmake them carry water in a sieve: and in this life they attribute to\\nthem the infamy which Glaucon was assuming to be the lot of the just\\nwho are supposed to be unjust.\\n\\n‘Take another kind of argument which is found both in poetry and\\nprose:—“Virtue,” as Hesiod says, “is honourable but difficult, vice is\\neasy and profitable.” You may often see the wicked in great prosperity\\nand the righteous afflicted by the will of heaven. And mendicant\\nprophets knock at rich men’s doors, promising to atone for the sins of\\nthemselves or their fathers in an easy fashion with sacrifices and\\nfestive games, or with charms and invocations to get rid of an enemy\\ngood or bad by divine help and at a small charge;—they appeal to books\\nprofessing to be written by Musaeus and Orpheus, and carry away the\\nminds of whole cities, and promise to “get souls out of purgatory;” and\\nif we refuse to listen to them, no one knows what will happen to us.\\n\\n‘When a lively-minded ingenuous youth hears all this, what will be his\\nconclusion? “Will he,” in the language of Pindar, “make justice his\\nhigh tower, or fortify himself with crooked deceit?” Justice, he\\nreflects, without the appearance of justice, is misery and ruin;\\ninjustice has the promise of a glorious life. Appearance is master of\\ntruth and lord of happiness. To appearance then I will turn,—I will put\\non the show of virtue and trail behind me the fox of Archilochus. I\\nhear some one saying that “wickedness is not easily concealed,” to\\nwhich I reply that “nothing great is easy.” Union and force and\\nrhetoric will do much; and if men say that they cannot prevail over the\\ngods, still how do we know that there are gods? Only from the poets,\\nwho acknowledge that they may be appeased by sacrifices. Then why not\\nsin and pay for indulgences out of your sin? For if the righteous are\\nonly unpunished, still they have no further reward, while the wicked\\nmay be unpunished and have the pleasure of sinning too. But what of the\\nworld below? Nay, says the argument, there are atoning powers who will\\nset that matter right, as the poets, who are the sons of the gods, tell\\nus; and this is confirmed by the authority of the State.\\n\\n‘How can we resist such arguments in favour of injustice? Add good\\nmanners, and, as the wise tell us, we shall make the best of both\\nworlds. Who that is not a miserable caitiff will refrain from smiling\\nat the praises of justice? Even if a man knows the better part he will\\nnot be angry with others; for he knows also that more than human virtue\\nis needed to save a man, and that he only praises justice who is\\nincapable of injustice.\\n\\n‘The origin of the evil is that all men from the beginning, heroes,\\npoets, instructors of youth, have always asserted “the temporal\\ndispensation,” the honours and profits of justice. Had we been taught\\nin early youth the power of justice and injustice inherent in the soul,\\nand unseen by any human or divine eye, we should not have needed others\\nto be our guardians, but every one would have been the guardian of\\nhimself. This is what I want you to show, Socrates;—other men use\\narguments which rather tend to strengthen the position of Thrasymachus\\nthat “might is right;” but from you I expect better things. And please,\\nas Glaucon said, to exclude reputation; let the just be thought unjust\\nand the unjust just, and do you still prove to us the superiority of\\njustice’...\\n\\nThe thesis, which for the sake of argument has been maintained by\\nGlaucon, is the converse of that of Thrasymachus—not right is the\\ninterest of the stronger, but right is the necessity of the weaker.\\nStarting from the same premises he carries the analysis of society a\\nstep further back;—might is still right, but the might is the weakness\\nof the many combined against the strength of the few.\\n\\nThere have been theories in modern as well as in ancient times which\\nhave a family likeness to the speculations of Glaucon; e.g. that power\\nis the foundation of right; or that a monarch has a divine right to\\ngovern well or ill; or that virtue is self-love or the love of power;\\nor that war is the natural state of man; or that private vices are\\npublic benefits. All such theories have a kind of plausibility from\\ntheir partial agreement with experience. For human nature oscillates\\nbetween good and evil, and the motives of actions and the origin of\\ninstitutions may be explained to a certain extent on either hypothesis\\naccording to the character or point of view of a particular thinker.\\nThe obligation of maintaining authority under all circumstances and\\nsometimes by rather questionable means is felt strongly and has become\\na sort of instinct among civilized men. The divine right of kings, or\\nmore generally of governments, is one of the forms under which this\\nnatural feeling is expressed. Nor again is there any evil which has not\\nsome accompaniment of good or pleasure; nor any good which is free from\\nsome alloy of evil; nor any noble or generous thought which may not be\\nattended by a shadow or the ghost of a shadow of self-interest or of\\nself-love. We know that all human actions are imperfect; but we do not\\ntherefore attribute them to the worse rather than to the better motive\\nor principle. Such a philosophy is both foolish and false, like that\\nopinion of the clever rogue who assumes all other men to be like\\nhimself. And theories of this sort do not represent the real nature of\\nthe State, which is based on a vague sense of right gradually corrected\\nand enlarged by custom and law (although capable also of perversion),\\nany more than they describe the origin of society, which is to be\\nsought in the family and in the social and religious feelings of man.\\nNor do they represent the average character of individuals, which\\ncannot be explained simply on a theory of evil, but has always a\\ncounteracting element of good. And as men become better such theories\\nappear more and more untruthful to them, because they are more\\nconscious of their own disinterestedness. A little experience may make\\na man a cynic; a great deal will bring him back to a truer and kindlier\\nview of the mixed nature of himself and his fellow men.\\n\\nThe two brothers ask Socrates to prove to them that the just is happy\\nwhen they have taken from him all that in which happiness is ordinarily\\nsupposed to consist. Not that there is (1) any absurdity in the attempt\\nto frame a notion of justice apart from circumstances. For the ideal\\nmust always be a paradox when compared with the ordinary conditions of\\nhuman life. Neither the Stoical ideal nor the Christian ideal is true\\nas a fact, but they may serve as a basis of education, and may exercise\\nan ennobling influence. An ideal is none the worse because ‘some one\\nhas made the discovery’ that no such ideal was ever realized. And in a\\nfew exceptional individuals who are raised above the ordinary level of\\nhumanity, the ideal of happiness may be realized in death and misery.\\nThis may be the state which the reason deliberately approves, and which\\nthe utilitarian as well as every other moralist may be bound in certain\\ncases to prefer.\\n\\nNor again, (2) must we forget that Plato, though he agrees generally\\nwith the view implied in the argument of the two brothers, is not\\nexpressing his own final conclusion, but rather seeking to dramatize\\none of the aspects of ethical truth. He is developing his idea\\ngradually in a series of positions or situations. He is exhibiting\\nSocrates for the first time undergoing the Socratic interrogation.\\nLastly, (3) the word ‘happiness’ involves some degree of confusion\\nbecause associated in the language of modern philosophy with conscious\\npleasure or satisfaction, which was not equally present to his mind.\\n\\nGlaucon has been drawing a picture of the misery of the just and the\\nhappiness of the unjust, to which the misery of the tyrant in Book IX\\nis the answer and parallel. And still the unjust must appear just; that\\nis ‘the homage which vice pays to virtue.’ But now Adeimantus, taking\\nup the hint which had been already given by Glaucon, proceeds to show\\nthat in the opinion of mankind justice is regarded only for the sake of\\nrewards and reputation, and points out the advantage which is given to\\nsuch arguments as those of Thrasymachus and Glaucon by the conventional\\nmorality of mankind. He seems to feel the difficulty of ‘justifying the\\nways of God to man.’ Both the brothers touch upon the question, whether\\nthe morality of actions is determined by their consequences; and both\\nof them go beyond the position of Socrates, that justice belongs to the\\nclass of goods not desirable for themselves only, but desirable for\\nthemselves and for their results, to which he recalls them. In their\\nattempt to view justice as an internal principle, and in their\\ncondemnation of the poets, they anticipate him. The common life of\\nGreece is not enough for them; they must penetrate deeper into the\\nnature of things.\\n\\nIt has been objected that justice is honesty in the sense of Glaucon\\nand Adeimantus, but is taken by Socrates to mean all virtue. May we not\\nmore truly say that the old-fashioned notion of justice is enlarged by\\nSocrates, and becomes equivalent to universal order or well-being,\\nfirst in the State, and secondly in the individual? He has found a new\\nanswer to his old question (Protag.), ‘whether the virtues are one or\\nmany,’ viz. that one is the ordering principle of the three others. In\\nseeking to establish the purely internal nature of justice, he is met\\nby the fact that man is a social being, and he tries to harmonise the\\ntwo opposite theses as well as he can. There is no more inconsistency\\nin this than was inevitable in his age and country; there is no use in\\nturning upon him the cross lights of modern philosophy, which, from\\nsome other point of view, would appear equally inconsistent. Plato does\\nnot give the final solution of philosophical questions for us; nor can\\nhe be judged of by our standard.\\n\\nThe remainder of the Republic is developed out of the question of the\\nsons of Ariston. Three points are deserving of remark in what\\nimmediately follows:—First, that the answer of Socrates is altogether\\nindirect. He does not say that happiness consists in the contemplation\\nof the idea of justice, and still less will he be tempted to affirm the\\nStoical paradox that the just man can be happy on the rack. But first\\nhe dwells on the difficulty of the problem and insists on restoring man\\nto his natural condition, before he will answer the question at all. He\\ntoo will frame an ideal, but his ideal comprehends not only abstract\\njustice, but the whole relations of man. Under the fanciful\\nillustration of the large letters he implies that he will only look for\\njustice in society, and that from the State he will proceed to the\\nindividual. His answer in substance amounts to this,—that under\\nfavourable conditions, i.e. in the perfect State, justice and happiness\\nwill coincide, and that when justice has been once found, happiness may\\nbe left to take care of itself. That he falls into some degree of\\ninconsistency, when in the tenth book he claims to have got rid of the\\nrewards and honours of justice, may be admitted; for he has left those\\nwhich exist in the perfect State. And the philosopher ‘who retires\\nunder the shelter of a wall’ can hardly have been esteemed happy by\\nhim, at least not in this world. Still he maintains the true attitude\\nof moral action. Let a man do his duty first, without asking whether he\\nwill be happy or not, and happiness will be the inseparable accident\\nwhich attends him. ‘Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his\\nrighteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.’\\n\\nSecondly, it may be remarked that Plato preserves the genuine character\\nof Greek thought in beginning with the State and in going on to the\\nindividual. First ethics, then politics—this is the order of ideas to\\nus; the reverse is the order of history. Only after many struggles of\\nthought does the individual assert his right as a moral being. In early\\nages he is not ONE, but one of many, the citizen of a State which is\\nprior to him; and he has no notion of good or evil apart from the law\\nof his country or the creed of his church. And to this type he is\\nconstantly tending to revert, whenever the influence of custom, or of\\nparty spirit, or the recollection of the past becomes too strong for\\nhim.\\n\\nThirdly, we may observe the confusion or identification of the\\nindividual and the State, of ethics and politics, which pervades early\\nGreek speculation, and even in modern times retains a certain degree of\\ninfluence. The subtle difference between the collective and individual\\naction of mankind seems to have escaped early thinkers, and we too are\\nsometimes in danger of forgetting the conditions of united human\\naction, whenever we either elevate politics into ethics, or lower\\nethics to the standard of politics. The good man and the good citizen\\nonly coincide in the perfect State; and this perfection cannot be\\nattained by legislation acting upon them from without, but, if at all,\\nby education fashioning them from within.\\n\\n...Socrates praises the sons of Ariston, ‘inspired offspring of the\\nrenowned hero,’ as the elegiac poet terms them; but he does not\\nunderstand how they can argue so eloquently on behalf of injustice\\nwhile their character shows that they are uninfluenced by their own\\narguments. He knows not how to answer them, although he is afraid of\\ndeserting justice in the hour of need. He therefore makes a condition,\\nthat having weak eyes he shall be allowed to read the large letters\\nfirst and then go on to the smaller, that is, he must look for justice\\nin the State first, and will then proceed to the individual.\\nAccordingly he begins to construct the State.\\n\\nSociety arises out of the wants of man. His first want is food; his\\nsecond a house; his third a coat. The sense of these needs and the\\npossibility of satisfying them by exchange, draw individuals together\\non the same spot; and this is the beginning of a State, which we take\\nthe liberty to invent, although necessity is the real inventor. There\\nmust be first a husbandman, secondly a builder, thirdly a weaver, to\\nwhich may be added a cobbler. Four or five citizens at least are\\nrequired to make a city. Now men have different natures, and one man\\nwill do one thing better than many; and business waits for no man.\\nHence there must be a division of labour into different employments;\\ninto wholesale and retail trade; into workers, and makers of workmen’s\\ntools; into shepherds and husbandmen. A city which includes all this\\nwill have far exceeded the limit of four or five, and yet not be very\\nlarge. But then again imports will be required, and imports necessitate\\nexports, and this implies variety of produce in order to attract the\\ntaste of purchasers; also merchants and ships. In the city too we must\\nhave a market and money and retail trades; otherwise buyers and sellers\\nwill never meet, and the valuable time of the producers will be wasted\\nin vain efforts at exchange. If we add hired servants the State will be\\ncomplete. And we may guess that somewhere in the intercourse of the\\ncitizens with one another justice and injustice will appear.\\n\\nHere follows a rustic picture of their way of life. They spend their\\ndays in houses which they have built for themselves; they make their\\nown clothes and produce their own corn and wine. Their principal food\\nis meal and flour, and they drink in moderation. They live on the best\\nof terms with each other, and take care not to have too many children.\\n‘But,’ said Glaucon, interposing, ‘are they not to have a relish?’\\nCertainly; they will have salt and olives and cheese, vegetables and\\nfruits, and chestnuts to roast at the fire. ‘’Tis a city of pigs,\\nSocrates.’ Why, I replied, what do you want more? ‘Only the comforts of\\nlife,—sofas and tables, also sauces and sweets.’ I see; you want not\\nonly a State, but a luxurious State; and possibly in the more complex\\nframe we may sooner find justice and injustice. Then the fine arts must\\ngo to work—every conceivable instrument and ornament of luxury will be\\nwanted. There will be dancers, painters, sculptors, musicians, cooks,\\nbarbers, tire-women, nurses, artists; swineherds and neatherds too for\\nthe animals, and physicians to cure the disorders of which luxury is\\nthe source. To feed all these superfluous mouths we shall need a part\\nof our neighbour’s land, and they will want a part of ours. And this is\\nthe origin of war, which may be traced to the same causes as other\\npolitical evils. Our city will now require the slight addition of a\\ncamp, and the citizen will be converted into a soldier. But then again\\nour old doctrine of the division of labour must not be forgotten. The\\nart of war cannot be learned in a day, and there must be a natural\\naptitude for military duties. There will be some warlike natures who\\nhave this aptitude—dogs keen of scent, swift of foot to pursue, and\\nstrong of limb to fight. And as spirit is the foundation of courage,\\nsuch natures, whether of men or animals, will be full of spirit. But\\nthese spirited natures are apt to bite and devour one another; the\\nunion of gentleness to friends and fierceness against enemies appears\\nto be an impossibility, and the guardian of a State requires both\\nqualities. Who then can be a guardian? The image of the dog suggests an\\nanswer. For dogs are gentle to friends and fierce to strangers. Your\\ndog is a philosopher who judges by the rule of knowing or not knowing;\\nand philosophy, whether in man or beast, is the parent of gentleness.\\nThe human watchdogs must be philosophers or lovers of learning which\\nwill make them gentle. And how are they to be learned without\\neducation?\\n\\nBut what shall their education be? Is any better than the old-fashioned\\nsort which is comprehended under the name of music and gymnastic? Music\\nincludes literature, and literature is of two kinds, true and false.\\n‘What do you mean?’ he said. I mean that children hear stories before\\nthey learn gymnastics, and that the stories are either untrue, or have\\nat most one or two grains of truth in a bushel of falsehood. Now early\\nlife is very impressible, and children ought not to learn what they\\nwill have to unlearn when they grow up; we must therefore have a\\ncensorship of nursery tales, banishing some and keeping others. Some of\\nthem are very improper, as we may see in the great instances of Homer\\nand Hesiod, who not only tell lies but bad lies; stories about Uranus\\nand Saturn, which are immoral as well as false, and which should never\\nbe spoken of to young persons, or indeed at all; or, if at all, then in\\na mystery, after the sacrifice, not of an Eleusinian pig, but of some\\nunprocurable animal. Shall our youth be encouraged to beat their\\nfathers by the example of Zeus, or our citizens be incited to quarrel\\nby hearing or seeing representations of strife among the gods? Shall\\nthey listen to the narrative of Hephaestus binding his mother, and of\\nZeus sending him flying for helping her when she was beaten? Such tales\\nmay possibly have a mystical interpretation, but the young are\\nincapable of understanding allegory. If any one asks what tales are to\\nbe allowed, we will answer that we are legislators and not book-makers;\\nwe only lay down the principles according to which books are to be\\nwritten; to write them is the duty of others.\\n\\nAnd our first principle is, that God must be represented as he is; not\\nas the author of all things, but of good only. We will not suffer the\\npoets to say that he is the steward of good and evil, or that he has\\ntwo casks full of destinies;—or that Athene and Zeus incited Pandarus\\nto break the treaty; or that God caused the sufferings of Niobe, or of\\nPelops, or the Trojan war; or that he makes men sin when he wishes to\\ndestroy them. Either these were not the actions of the gods, or God was\\njust, and men were the better for being punished. But that the deed was\\nevil, and God the author, is a wicked, suicidal fiction which we will\\nallow no one, old or young, to utter. This is our first and great\\nprinciple—God is the author of good only.\\n\\nAnd the second principle is like unto it:—With God is no variableness\\nor change of form. Reason teaches us this; for if we suppose a change\\nin God, he must be changed either by another or by himself. By\\nanother?—but the best works of nature and art and the noblest qualities\\nof mind are least liable to be changed by any external force. By\\nhimself?—but he cannot change for the better; he will hardly change for\\nthe worse. He remains for ever fairest and best in his own image.\\nTherefore we refuse to listen to the poets who tell us of Here begging\\nin the likeness of a priestess or of other deities who prowl about at\\nnight in strange disguises; all that blasphemous nonsense with which\\nmothers fool the manhood out of their children must be suppressed. But\\nsome one will say that God, who is himself unchangeable, may take a\\nform in relation to us. Why should he? For gods as well as men hate the\\nlie in the soul, or principle of falsehood; and as for any other form\\nof lying which is used for a purpose and is regarded as innocent in\\ncertain exceptional cases—what need have the gods of this? For they are\\nnot ignorant of antiquity like the poets, nor are they afraid of their\\nenemies, nor is any madman a friend of theirs. God then is true, he is\\nabsolutely true; he changes not, he deceives not, by day or night, by\\nword or sign. This is our second great principle—God is true. Away with\\nthe lying dream of Agamemnon in Homer, and the accusation of Thetis\\nagainst Apollo in Aeschylus...\\n\\nIn order to give clearness to his conception of the State, Plato\\nproceeds to trace the first principles of mutual need and of division\\nof labour in an imaginary community of four or five citizens. Gradually\\nthis community increases; the division of labour extends to countries;\\nimports necessitate exports; a medium of exchange is required, and\\nretailers sit in the market-place to save the time of the producers.\\nThese are the steps by which Plato constructs the first or primitive\\nState, introducing the elements of political economy by the way. As he\\nis going to frame a second or civilized State, the simple naturally\\ncomes before the complex. He indulges, like Rousseau, in a picture of\\nprimitive life—an idea which has indeed often had a powerful influence\\non the imagination of mankind, but he does not seriously mean to say\\nthat one is better than the other (Politicus); nor can any inference be\\ndrawn from the description of the first state taken apart from the\\nsecond, such as Aristotle appears to draw in the Politics. We should\\nnot interpret a Platonic dialogue any more than a poem or a parable in\\ntoo literal or matter-of-fact a style. On the other hand, when we\\ncompare the lively fancy of Plato with the dried-up abstractions of\\nmodern treatises on philosophy, we are compelled to say with\\nProtagoras, that the ‘mythus is more interesting’ (Protag.)\\n\\nSeveral interesting remarks which in modern times would have a place in\\na treatise on Political Economy are scattered up and down the writings\\nof Plato: especially Laws, Population; Free Trade; Adulteration; Wills\\nand Bequests; Begging; Eryxias, (though not Plato’s), Value and Demand;\\nRepublic, Division of Labour. The last subject, and also the origin of\\nRetail Trade, is treated with admirable lucidity in the second book of\\nthe Republic. But Plato never combined his economic ideas into a\\nsystem, and never seems to have recognized that Trade is one of the\\ngreat motive powers of the State and of the world. He would make retail\\ntraders only of the inferior sort of citizens (Rep., Laws), though he\\nremarks, quaintly enough (Laws), that ‘if only the best men and the\\nbest women everywhere were compelled to keep taverns for a time or to\\ncarry on retail trade, etc., then we should knew how pleasant and\\nagreeable all these things are.’\\n\\nThe disappointment of Glaucon at the ‘city of pigs,’ the ludicrous\\ndescription of the ministers of luxury in the more refined State, and\\nthe afterthought of the necessity of doctors, the illustration of the\\nnature of the guardian taken from the dog, the desirableness of\\noffering some almost unprocurable victim when impure mysteries are to\\nbe celebrated, the behaviour of Zeus to his father and of Hephaestus to\\nhis mother, are touches of humour which have also a serious meaning. In\\nspeaking of education Plato rather startles us by affirming that a\\nchild must be trained in falsehood first and in truth afterwards. Yet\\nthis is not very different from saying that children must be taught\\nthrough the medium of imagination as well as reason; that their minds\\ncan only develope gradually, and that there is much which they must\\nlearn without understanding. This is also the substance of Plato’s\\nview, though he must be acknowledged to have drawn the line somewhat\\ndifferently from modern ethical writers, respecting truth and\\nfalsehood. To us, economies or accommodations would not be allowable\\nunless they were required by the human faculties or necessary for the\\ncommunication of knowledge to the simple and ignorant. We should insist\\nthat the word was inseparable from the intention, and that we must not\\nbe ‘falsely true,’ i.e. speak or act falsely in support of what was\\nright or true. But Plato would limit the use of fictions only by\\nrequiring that they should have a good moral effect, and that such a\\ndangerous weapon as falsehood should be employed by the rulers alone\\nand for great objects.\\n\\nA Greek in the age of Plato attached no importance to the question\\nwhether his religion was an historical fact. He was just beginning to\\nbe conscious that the past had a history; but he could see nothing\\nbeyond Homer and Hesiod. Whether their narratives were true or false\\ndid not seriously affect the political or social life of Hellas. Men\\nonly began to suspect that they were fictions when they recognised them\\nto be immoral. And so in all religions: the consideration of their\\nmorality comes first, afterwards the truth of the documents in which\\nthey are recorded, or of the events natural or supernatural which are\\ntold of them. But in modern times, and in Protestant countries perhaps\\nmore than in Catholic, we have been too much inclined to identify the\\nhistorical with the moral; and some have refused to believe in religion\\nat all, unless a superhuman accuracy was discernible in every part of\\nthe record. The facts of an ancient or religious history are amongst\\nthe most important of all facts; but they are frequently uncertain, and\\nwe only learn the true lesson which is to be gathered from them when we\\nplace ourselves above them. These reflections tend to show that the\\ndifference between Plato and ourselves, though not unimportant, is not\\nso great as might at first sight appear. For we should agree with him\\nin placing the moral before the historical truth of religion; and,\\ngenerally, in disregarding those errors or misstatements of fact which\\nnecessarily occur in the early stages of all religions. We know also\\nthat changes in the traditions of a country cannot be made in a day;\\nand are therefore tolerant of many things which science and criticism\\nwould condemn.\\n\\nWe note in passing that the allegorical interpretation of mythology,\\nsaid to have been first introduced as early as the sixth century before\\nChrist by Theagenes of Rhegium, was well established in the age of\\nPlato, and here, as in the Phaedrus, though for a different reason, was\\nrejected by him. That anachronisms whether of religion or law, when men\\nhave reached another stage of civilization, should be got rid of by\\nfictions is in accordance with universal experience. Great is the art\\nof interpretation; and by a natural process, which when once discovered\\nwas always going on, what could not be altered was explained away. And\\nso without any palpable inconsistency there existed side by side two\\nforms of religion, the tradition inherited or invented by the poets and\\nthe customary worship of the temple; on the other hand, there was the\\nreligion of the philosopher, who was dwelling in the heaven of ideas,\\nbut did not therefore refuse to offer a cock to Aesculapius, or to be\\nseen saying his prayers at the rising of the sun. At length the\\nantagonism between the popular and philosophical religion, never so\\ngreat among the Greeks as in our own age, disappeared, and was only\\nfelt like the difference between the religion of the educated and\\nuneducated among ourselves. The Zeus of Homer and Hesiod easily passed\\ninto the ‘royal mind’ of Plato (Philebus); the giant Heracles became\\nthe knight-errant and benefactor of mankind. These and still more\\nwonderful transformations were readily effected by the ingenuity of\\nStoics and neo-Platonists in the two or three centuries before and\\nafter Christ. The Greek and Roman religions were gradually permeated by\\nthe spirit of philosophy; having lost their ancient meaning, they were\\nresolved into poetry and morality; and probably were never purer than\\nat the time of their decay, when their influence over the world was\\nwaning.\\n\\nA singular conception which occurs towards the end of the book is the\\nlie in the soul; this is connected with the Platonic and Socratic\\ndoctrine that involuntary ignorance is worse than voluntary. The lie in\\nthe soul is a true lie, the corruption of the highest truth, the\\ndeception of the highest part of the soul, from which he who is\\ndeceived has no power of delivering himself. For example, to represent\\nGod as false or immoral, or, according to Plato, as deluding men with\\nappearances or as the author of evil; or again, to affirm with\\nProtagoras that ‘knowledge is sensation,’ or that ‘being is becoming,’\\nor with Thrasymachus ‘that might is right,’ would have been regarded by\\nPlato as a lie of this hateful sort. The greatest unconsciousness of\\nthe greatest untruth, e.g. if, in the language of the Gospels (John),\\n‘he who was blind’ were to say ‘I see,’ is another aspect of the state\\nof mind which Plato is describing. The lie in the soul may be further\\ncompared with the sin against the Holy Ghost (Luke), allowing for the\\ndifference between Greek and Christian modes of speaking. To this is\\nopposed the lie in words, which is only such a deception as may occur\\nin a play or poem, or allegory or figure of speech, or in any sort of\\naccommodation,—which though useless to the gods may be useful to men in\\ncertain cases. Socrates is here answering the question which he had\\nhimself raised about the propriety of deceiving a madman; and he is\\nalso contrasting the nature of God and man. For God is Truth, but\\nmankind can only be true by appearing sometimes to be partial, or\\nfalse. Reserving for another place the greater questions of religion or\\neducation, we may note further, (1) the approval of the old traditional\\neducation of Greece; (2) the preparation which Plato is making for the\\nattack on Homer and the poets; (3) the preparation which he is also\\nmaking for the use of economies in the State; (4) the contemptuous and\\nat the same time euphemistic manner in which here as below he alludes\\nto the ‘Chronique Scandaleuse’ of the gods.\\n\\nBOOK III. There is another motive in purifying religion, which is to\\nbanish fear; for no man can be courageous who is afraid of death, or\\nwho believes the tales which are repeated by the poets concerning the\\nworld below. They must be gently requested not to abuse hell; they may\\nbe reminded that their stories are both untrue and discouraging. Nor\\nmust they be angry if we expunge obnoxious passages, such as the\\ndepressing words of Achilles—‘I would rather be a serving-man than rule\\nover all the dead;’ and the verses which tell of the squalid mansions,\\nthe senseless shadows, the flitting soul mourning over lost strength\\nand youth, the soul with a gibber going beneath the earth like smoke,\\nor the souls of the suitors which flutter about like bats. The terrors\\nand horrors of Cocytus and Styx, ghosts and sapless shades, and the\\nrest of their Tartarean nomenclature, must vanish. Such tales may have\\ntheir use; but they are not the proper food for soldiers. As little can\\nwe admit the sorrows and sympathies of the Homeric heroes:—Achilles,\\nthe son of Thetis, in tears, throwing ashes on his head, or pacing up\\nand down the sea-shore in distraction; or Priam, the cousin of the\\ngods, crying aloud, rolling in the mire. A good man is not prostrated\\nat the loss of children or fortune. Neither is death terrible to him;\\nand therefore lamentations over the dead should not be practised by men\\nof note; they should be the concern of inferior persons only, whether\\nwomen or men. Still worse is the attribution of such weakness to the\\ngods; as when the goddesses say, ‘Alas! my travail!’ and worst of all,\\nwhen the king of heaven himself laments his inability to save Hector,\\nor sorrows over the impending doom of his dear Sarpedon. Such a\\ncharacter of God, if not ridiculed by our young men, is likely to be\\nimitated by them. Nor should our citizens be given to excess of\\nlaughter—‘Such violent delights’ are followed by a violent re-action.\\nThe description in the Iliad of the gods shaking their sides at the\\nclumsiness of Hephaestus will not be admitted by us. ‘Certainly not.’\\n\\nTruth should have a high place among the virtues, for falsehood, as we\\nwere saying, is useless to the gods, and only useful to men as a\\nmedicine. But this employment of falsehood must remain a privilege of\\nstate; the common man must not in return tell a lie to the ruler; any\\nmore than the patient would tell a lie to his physician, or the sailor\\nto his captain.\\n\\nIn the next place our youth must be temperate, and temperance consists\\nin self-control and obedience to authority. That is a lesson which\\nHomer teaches in some places: ‘The Achaeans marched on breathing\\nprowess, in silent awe of their leaders;’—but a very different one in\\nother places: ‘O heavy with wine, who hast the eyes of a dog, but the\\nheart of a stag.’ Language of the latter kind will not impress\\nself-control on the minds of youth. The same may be said about his\\npraises of eating and drinking and his dread of starvation; also about\\nthe verses in which he tells of the rapturous loves of Zeus and Here,\\nor of how Hephaestus once detained Ares and Aphrodite in a net on a\\nsimilar occasion. There is a nobler strain heard in the words:—‘Endure,\\nmy soul, thou hast endured worse.’ Nor must we allow our citizens to\\nreceive bribes, or to say, ‘Gifts persuade the gods, gifts reverend\\nkings;’ or to applaud the ignoble advice of Phoenix to Achilles that he\\nshould get money out of the Greeks before he assisted them; or the\\nmeanness of Achilles himself in taking gifts from Agamemnon; or his\\nrequiring a ransom for the body of Hector; or his cursing of Apollo; or\\nhis insolence to the river-god Scamander; or his dedication to the dead\\nPatroclus of his own hair which had been already dedicated to the other\\nriver-god Spercheius; or his cruelty in dragging the body of Hector\\nround the walls, and slaying the captives at the pyre: such a\\ncombination of meanness and cruelty in Cheiron’s pupil is\\ninconceivable. The amatory exploits of Peirithous and Theseus are\\nequally unworthy. Either these so-called sons of gods were not the sons\\nof gods, or they were not such as the poets imagine them, any more than\\nthe gods themselves are the authors of evil. The youth who believes\\nthat such things are done by those who have the blood of heaven flowing\\nin their veins will be too ready to imitate their example.\\n\\nEnough of gods and heroes;—what shall we say about men? What the poets\\nand story-tellers say—that the wicked prosper and the righteous are\\nafflicted, or that justice is another’s gain? Such misrepresentations\\ncannot be allowed by us. But in this we are anticipating the definition\\nof justice, and had therefore better defer the enquiry.\\n\\nThe subjects of poetry have been sufficiently treated; next follows\\nstyle. Now all poetry is a narrative of events past, present, or to\\ncome; and narrative is of three kinds, the simple, the imitative, and a\\ncomposition of the two. An instance will make my meaning clear. The\\nfirst scene in Homer is of the last or mixed kind, being partly\\ndescription and partly dialogue. But if you throw the dialogue into the\\n‘oratio obliqua,’ the passage will run thus: The priest came and prayed\\nApollo that the Achaeans might take Troy and have a safe return if\\nAgamemnon would only give him back his daughter; and the other Greeks\\nassented, but Agamemnon was wroth, and so on—The whole then becomes\\ndescriptive, and the poet is the only speaker left; or, if you omit the\\nnarrative, the whole becomes dialogue. These are the three styles—which\\nof them is to be admitted into our State? ‘Do you ask whether tragedy\\nand comedy are to be admitted?’ Yes, but also something more—Is it not\\ndoubtful whether our guardians are to be imitators at all? Or rather,\\nhas not the question been already answered, for we have decided that\\none man cannot in his life play many parts, any more than he can act\\nboth tragedy and comedy, or be rhapsodist and actor at once? Human\\nnature is coined into very small pieces, and as our guardians have\\ntheir own business already, which is the care of freedom, they will\\nhave enough to do without imitating. If they imitate they should\\nimitate, not any meanness or baseness, but the good only; for the mask\\nwhich the actor wears is apt to become his face. We cannot allow men to\\nplay the parts of women, quarrelling, weeping, scolding, or boasting\\nagainst the gods,—least of all when making love or in labour. They must\\nnot represent slaves, or bullies, or cowards, drunkards, or madmen, or\\nblacksmiths, or neighing horses, or bellowing bulls, or sounding\\nrivers, or a raging sea. A good or wise man will be willing to perform\\ngood and wise actions, but he will be ashamed to play an inferior part\\nwhich he has never practised; and he will prefer to employ the\\ndescriptive style with as little imitation as possible. The man who has\\nno self-respect, on the contrary, will imitate anybody and anything;\\nsounds of nature and cries of animals alike; his whole performance will\\nbe imitation of gesture and voice. Now in the descriptive style there\\nare few changes, but in the dramatic there are a great many. Poets and\\nmusicians use either, or a compound of both, and this compound is very\\nattractive to youth and their teachers as well as to the vulgar. But\\nour State in which one man plays one part only is not adapted for\\ncomplexity. And when one of these polyphonous pantomimic gentlemen\\noffers to exhibit himself and his poetry we will show him every\\nobservance of respect, but at the same time tell him that there is no\\nroom for his kind in our State; we prefer the rough, honest poet, and\\nwill not depart from our original models (Laws).\\n\\nNext as to the music. A song or ode has three parts,—the subject, the\\nharmony, and the rhythm; of which the two last are dependent upon the\\nfirst. As we banished strains of lamentation, so we may now banish the\\nmixed Lydian harmonies, which are the harmonies of lamentation; and as\\nour citizens are to be temperate, we may also banish convivial\\nharmonies, such as the Ionian and pure Lydian. Two remain—the Dorian\\nand Phrygian, the first for war, the second for peace; the one\\nexpressive of courage, the other of obedience or instruction or\\nreligious feeling. And as we reject varieties of harmony, we shall also\\nreject the many-stringed, variously-shaped instruments which give\\nutterance to them, and in particular the flute, which is more complex\\nthan any of them. The lyre and the harp may be permitted in the town,\\nand the Pan’s-pipe in the fields. Thus we have made a purgation of\\nmusic, and will now make a purgation of metres. These should be like\\nthe harmonies, simple and suitable to the occasion. There are four\\nnotes of the tetrachord, and there are three ratios of metre, 3/2, 2/2,\\n2/1, which have all their characteristics, and the feet have different\\ncharacteristics as well as the rhythms. But about this you and I must\\nask Damon, the great musician, who speaks, if I remember rightly, of a\\nmartial measure as well as of dactylic, trochaic, and iambic rhythms,\\nwhich he arranges so as to equalize the syllables with one another,\\nassigning to each the proper quantity. We only venture to affirm the\\ngeneral principle that the style is to conform to the subject and the\\nmetre to the style; and that the simplicity and harmony of the soul\\nshould be reflected in them all. This principle of simplicity has to be\\nlearnt by every one in the days of his youth, and may be gathered\\nanywhere, from the creative and constructive arts, as well as from the\\nforms of plants and animals.\\n\\nOther artists as well as poets should be warned against meanness or\\nunseemliness. Sculpture and painting equally with music must conform to\\nthe law of simplicity. He who violates it cannot be allowed to work in\\nour city, and to corrupt the taste of our citizens. For our guardians\\nmust grow up, not amid images of deformity which will gradually poison\\nand corrupt their souls, but in a land of health and beauty where they\\nwill drink in from every object sweet and harmonious influences. And of\\nall these influences the greatest is the education given by music,\\nwhich finds a way into the innermost soul and imparts to it the sense\\nof beauty and of deformity. At first the effect is unconscious; but\\nwhen reason arrives, then he who has been thus trained welcomes her as\\nthe friend whom he always knew. As in learning to read, first we\\nacquire the elements or letters separately, and afterwards their\\ncombinations, and cannot recognize reflections of them until we know\\nthe letters themselves;—in like manner we must first attain the\\nelements or essential forms of the virtues, and then trace their\\ncombinations in life and experience. There is a music of the soul which\\nanswers to the harmony of the world; and the fairest object of a\\nmusical soul is the fair mind in the fair body. Some defect in the\\nlatter may be excused, but not in the former. True love is the daughter\\nof temperance, and temperance is utterly opposed to the madness of\\nbodily pleasure. Enough has been said of music, which makes a fair\\nending with love.\\n\\nNext we pass on to gymnastics; about which I would remark, that the\\nsoul is related to the body as a cause to an effect, and therefore if\\nwe educate the mind we may leave the education of the body in her\\ncharge, and need only give a general outline of the course to be\\npursued. In the first place the guardians must abstain from strong\\ndrink, for they should be the last persons to lose their wits. Whether\\nthe habits of the palaestra are suitable to them is more doubtful, for\\nthe ordinary gymnastic is a sleepy sort of thing, and if left off\\nsuddenly is apt to endanger health. But our warrior athletes must be\\nwide-awake dogs, and must also be inured to all changes of food and\\nclimate. Hence they will require a simpler kind of gymnastic, akin to\\ntheir simple music; and for their diet a rule may be found in Homer,\\nwho feeds his heroes on roast meat only, and gives them no fish\\nalthough they are living at the sea-side, nor boiled meats which\\ninvolve an apparatus of pots and pans; and, if I am not mistaken, he\\nnowhere mentions sweet sauces. Sicilian cookery and Attic confections\\nand Corinthian courtezans, which are to gymnastic what Lydian and\\nIonian melodies are to music, must be forbidden. Where gluttony and\\nintemperance prevail the town quickly fills with doctors and pleaders;\\nand law and medicine give themselves airs as soon as the freemen of a\\nState take an interest in them. But what can show a more disgraceful\\nstate of education than to have to go abroad for justice because you\\nhave none of your own at home? And yet there IS a worse stage of the\\nsame disease—when men have learned to take a pleasure and pride in the\\ntwists and turns of the law; not considering how much better it would\\nbe for them so to order their lives as to have no need of a nodding\\njustice. And there is a like disgrace in employing a physician, not for\\nthe cure of wounds or epidemic disorders, but because a man has by\\nlaziness and luxury contracted diseases which were unknown in the days\\nof Asclepius. How simple is the Homeric practice of medicine. Eurypylus\\nafter he has been wounded drinks a posset of Pramnian wine, which is of\\na heating nature; and yet the sons of Asclepius blame neither the\\ndamsel who gives him the drink, nor Patroclus who is attending on him.\\nThe truth is that this modern system of nursing diseases was introduced\\nby Herodicus the trainer; who, being of a sickly constitution, by a\\ncompound of training and medicine tortured first himself and then a\\ngood many other people, and lived a great deal longer than he had any\\nright. But Asclepius would not practise this art, because he knew that\\nthe citizens of a well-ordered State have no leisure to be ill, and\\ntherefore he adopted the ‘kill or cure’ method, which artisans and\\nlabourers employ. ‘They must be at their business,’ they say, ‘and have\\nno time for coddling: if they recover, well; if they don’t, there is an\\nend of them.’ Whereas the rich man is supposed to be a gentleman who\\ncan afford to be ill. Do you know a maxim of Phocylides—that ‘when a\\nman begins to be rich’ (or, perhaps, a little sooner) ‘he should\\npractise virtue’? But how can excessive care of health be inconsistent\\nwith an ordinary occupation, and yet consistent with that practice of\\nvirtue which Phocylides inculcates? When a student imagines that\\nphilosophy gives him a headache, he never does anything; he is always\\nunwell. This was the reason why Asclepius and his sons practised no\\nsuch art. They were acting in the interest of the public, and did not\\nwish to preserve useless lives, or raise up a puny offspring to\\nwretched sires. Honest diseases they honestly cured; and if a man was\\nwounded, they applied the proper remedies, and then let him eat and\\ndrink what he liked. But they declined to treat intemperate and\\nworthless subjects, even though they might have made large fortunes out\\nof them. As to the story of Pindar, that Asclepius was slain by a\\nthunderbolt for restoring a rich man to life, that is a lie—following\\nour old rule we must say either that he did not take bribes, or that he\\nwas not the son of a god.\\n\\nGlaucon then asks Socrates whether the best physicians and the best\\njudges will not be those who have had severally the greatest experience\\nof diseases and of crimes. Socrates draws a distinction between the two\\nprofessions. The physician should have had experience of disease in his\\nown body, for he cures with his mind and not with his body. But the\\njudge controls mind by mind; and therefore his mind should not be\\ncorrupted by crime. Where then is he to gain experience? How is he to\\nbe wise and also innocent? When young a good man is apt to be deceived\\nby evil-doers, because he has no pattern of evil in himself; and\\ntherefore the judge should be of a certain age; his youth should have\\nbeen innocent, and he should have acquired insight into evil not by the\\npractice of it, but by the observation of it in others. This is the\\nideal of a judge; the criminal turned detective is wonderfully\\nsuspicious, but when in company with good men who have experience, he\\nis at fault, for he foolishly imagines that every one is as bad as\\nhimself. Vice may be known of virtue, but cannot know virtue. This is\\nthe sort of medicine and this the sort of law which will prevail in our\\nState; they will be healing arts to better natures; but the evil body\\nwill be left to die by the one, and the evil soul will be put to death\\nby the other. And the need of either will be greatly diminished by good\\nmusic which will give harmony to the soul, and good gymnastic which\\nwill give health to the body. Not that this division of music and\\ngymnastic really corresponds to soul and body; for they are both\\nequally concerned with the soul, which is tamed by the one and aroused\\nand sustained by the other. The two together supply our guardians with\\ntheir twofold nature. The passionate disposition when it has too much\\ngymnastic is hardened and brutalized, the gentle or philosophic temper\\nwhich has too much music becomes enervated. While a man is allowing\\nmusic to pour like water through the funnel of his ears, the edge of\\nhis soul gradually wears away, and the passionate or spirited element\\nis melted out of him. Too little spirit is easily exhausted; too much\\nquickly passes into nervous irritability. So, again, the athlete by\\nfeeding and training has his courage doubled, but he soon grows stupid;\\nhe is like a wild beast, ready to do everything by blows and nothing by\\ncounsel or policy. There are two principles in man, reason and passion,\\nand to these, not to the soul and body, the two arts of music and\\ngymnastic correspond. He who mingles them in harmonious concord is the\\ntrue musician,—he shall be the presiding genius of our State.\\n\\nThe next question is, Who are to be our rulers? First, the elder must\\nrule the younger; and the best of the elders will be the best\\nguardians. Now they will be the best who love their subjects most, and\\nthink that they have a common interest with them in the welfare of the\\nstate. These we must select; but they must be watched at every epoch of\\nlife to see whether they have retained the same opinions and held out\\nagainst force and enchantment. For time and persuasion and the love of\\npleasure may enchant a man into a change of purpose, and the force of\\ngrief and pain may compel him. And therefore our guardians must be men\\nwho have been tried by many tests, like gold in the refiner’s fire, and\\nhave been passed first through danger, then through pleasure, and at\\nevery age have come out of such trials victorious and without stain, in\\nfull command of themselves and their principles; having all their\\nfaculties in harmonious exercise for their country’s good. These shall\\nreceive the highest honours both in life and death. (It would perhaps\\nbe better to confine the term ‘guardians’ to this select class: the\\nyounger men may be called ‘auxiliaries.’)\\n\\nAnd now for one magnificent lie, in the belief of which, Oh that we\\ncould train our rulers!—at any rate let us make the attempt with the\\nrest of the world. What I am going to tell is only another version of\\nthe legend of Cadmus; but our unbelieving generation will be slow to\\naccept such a story. The tale must be imparted, first to the rulers,\\nthen to the soldiers, lastly to the people. We will inform them that\\ntheir youth was a dream, and that during the time when they seemed to\\nbe undergoing their education they were really being fashioned in the\\nearth, who sent them up when they were ready; and that they must\\nprotect and cherish her whose children they are, and regard each other\\nas brothers and sisters. ‘I do not wonder at your being ashamed to\\npropound such a fiction.’ There is more behind. These brothers and\\nsisters have different natures, and some of them God framed to rule,\\nwhom he fashioned of gold; others he made of silver, to be auxiliaries;\\nothers again to be husbandmen and craftsmen, and these were formed by\\nhim of brass and iron. But as they are all sprung from a common stock,\\na golden parent may have a silver son, or a silver parent a golden son,\\nand then there must be a change of rank; the son of the rich must\\ndescend, and the child of the artisan rise, in the social scale; for an\\noracle says ‘that the State will come to an end if governed by a man of\\nbrass or iron.’ Will our citizens ever believe all this? ‘Not in the\\npresent generation, but in the next, perhaps, Yes.’\\n\\nNow let the earthborn men go forth under the command of their rulers,\\nand look about and pitch their camp in a high place, which will be safe\\nagainst enemies from without, and likewise against insurrections from\\nwithin. There let them sacrifice and set up their tents; for soldiers\\nthey are to be and not shopkeepers, the watchdogs and guardians of the\\nsheep; and luxury and avarice will turn them into wolves and tyrants.\\nTheir habits and their dwellings should correspond to their education.\\nThey should have no property; their pay should only meet their\\nexpenses; and they should have common meals. Gold and silver we will\\ntell them that they have from God, and this divine gift in their souls\\nthey must not alloy with that earthly dross which passes under the name\\nof gold. They only of the citizens may not touch it, or be under the\\nsame roof with it, or drink from it; it is the accursed thing. Should\\nthey ever acquire houses or lands or money of their own, they will\\nbecome householders and tradesmen instead of guardians, enemies and\\ntyrants instead of helpers, and the hour of ruin, both to themselves\\nand the rest of the State, will be at hand.\\n\\nThe religious and ethical aspect of Plato’s education will hereafter be\\nconsidered under a separate head. Some lesser points may be more\\nconveniently noticed in this place.\\n\\n1. The constant appeal to the authority of Homer, whom, with grave\\nirony, Plato, after the manner of his age, summons as a witness about\\nethics and psychology, as well as about diet and medicine; attempting\\nto distinguish the better lesson from the worse, sometimes altering the\\ntext from design; more than once quoting or alluding to Homer\\ninaccurately, after the manner of the early logographers turning the\\nIliad into prose, and delighting to draw far-fetched inferences from\\nhis words, or to make ludicrous applications of them. He does not, like\\nHeracleitus, get into a rage with Homer and Archilochus (Heracl.), but\\nuses their words and expressions as vehicles of a higher truth; not on\\na system like Theagenes of Rhegium or Metrodorus, or in later times the\\nStoics, but as fancy may dictate. And the conclusions drawn from them\\nare sound, although the premises are fictitious. These fanciful appeals\\nto Homer add a charm to Plato’s style, and at the same time they have\\nthe effect of a satire on the follies of Homeric interpretation. To us\\n(and probably to himself), although they take the form of arguments,\\nthey are really figures of speech. They may be compared with modern\\ncitations from Scripture, which have often a great rhetorical power\\neven when the original meaning of the words is entirely lost sight of.\\nThe real, like the Platonic Socrates, as we gather from the Memorabilia\\nof Xenophon, was fond of making similar adaptations. Great in all ages\\nand countries, in religion as well as in law and literature, has been\\nthe art of interpretation.\\n\\n2. ‘The style is to conform to the subject and the metre to the style.’\\nNotwithstanding the fascination which the word ‘classical’ exercises\\nover us, we can hardly maintain that this rule is observed in all the\\nGreek poetry which has come down to us. We cannot deny that the thought\\noften exceeds the power of lucid expression in Aeschylus and Pindar; or\\nthat rhetoric gets the better of the thought in the Sophist-poet\\nEuripides. Only perhaps in Sophocles is there a perfect harmony of the\\ntwo; in him alone do we find a grace of language like the beauty of a\\nGreek statue, in which there is nothing to add or to take away; at\\nleast this is true of single plays or of large portions of them. The\\nconnection in the Tragic Choruses and in the Greek lyric poets is not\\nunfrequently a tangled thread which in an age before logic the poet was\\nunable to draw out. Many thoughts and feelings mingled in his mind, and\\nhe had no power of disengaging or arranging them. For there is a subtle\\ninfluence of logic which requires to be transferred from prose to\\npoetry, just as the music and perfection of language are infused by\\npoetry into prose. In all ages the poet has been a bad judge of his own\\nmeaning (Apol.); for he does not see that the word which is full of\\nassociations to his own mind is difficult and unmeaning to that of\\nanother; or that the sequence which is clear to himself is puzzling to\\nothers. There are many passages in some of our greatest modern poets\\nwhich are far too obscure; in which there is no proportion between\\nstyle and subject, in which any half-expressed figure, any harsh\\nconstruction, any distorted collocation of words, any remote sequence\\nof ideas is admitted; and there is no voice ‘coming sweetly from\\nnature,’ or music adding the expression of feeling to thought. As if\\nthere could be poetry without beauty, or beauty without ease and\\nclearness. The obscurities of early Greek poets arose necessarily out\\nof the state of language and logic which existed in their age. They are\\nnot examples to be followed by us; for the use of language ought in\\nevery generation to become clearer and clearer. Like Shakespere, they\\nwere great in spite, not in consequence, of their imperfections of\\nexpression. But there is no reason for returning to the necessary\\nobscurity which prevailed in the infancy of literature. The English\\npoets of the last century were certainly not obscure; and we have no\\nexcuse for losing what they had gained, or for going back to the\\nearlier or transitional age which preceded them. The thought of our own\\ntimes has not out-stripped language; a want of Plato’s ‘art of\\nmeasuring’ is the rule cause of the disproportion between them.\\n\\n3. In the third book of the Republic a nearer approach is made to a\\ntheory of art than anywhere else in Plato. His views may be summed up\\nas follows:—True art is not fanciful and imitative, but simple and\\nideal,—the expression of the highest moral energy, whether in action or\\nrepose. To live among works of plastic art which are of this noble and\\nsimple character, or to listen to such strains, is the best of\\ninfluences,—the true Greek atmosphere, in which youth should be brought\\nup. That is the way to create in them a natural good taste, which will\\nhave a feeling of truth and beauty in all things. For though the poets\\nare to be expelled, still art is recognized as another aspect of\\nreason—like love in the Symposium, extending over the same sphere, but\\nconfined to the preliminary education, and acting through the power of\\nhabit; and this conception of art is not limited to strains of music or\\nthe forms of plastic art, but pervades all nature and has a wide\\nkindred in the world. The Republic of Plato, like the Athens of\\nPericles, has an artistic as well as a political side.\\n\\nThere is hardly any mention in Plato of the creative arts; only in two\\nor three passages does he even allude to them (Rep.; Soph.). He is not\\nlost in rapture at the great works of Phidias, the Parthenon, the\\nPropylea, the statues of Zeus or Athene. He would probably have\\nregarded any abstract truth of number or figure as higher than the\\ngreatest of them. Yet it is hard to suppose that some influence, such\\nas he hopes to inspire in youth, did not pass into his own mind from\\nthe works of art which he saw around him. We are living upon the\\nfragments of them, and find in a few broken stones the standard of\\ntruth and beauty. But in Plato this feeling has no expression; he\\nnowhere says that beauty is the object of art; he seems to deny that\\nwisdom can take an external form (Phaedrus); he does not distinguish\\nthe fine from the mechanical arts. Whether or no, like some writers, he\\nfelt more than he expressed, it is at any rate remarkable that the\\ngreatest perfection of the fine arts should coincide with an almost\\nentire silence about them. In one very striking passage he tells us\\nthat a work of art, like the State, is a whole; and this conception of\\na whole and the love of the newly-born mathematical sciences may be\\nregarded, if not as the inspiring, at any rate as the regulating\\nprinciples of Greek art (Xen. Mem.; and Sophist).\\n\\n4. Plato makes the true and subtle remark that the physician had better\\nnot be in robust health; and should have known what illness is in his\\nown person. But the judge ought to have had no similar experience of\\nevil; he is to be a good man who, having passed his youth in innocence,\\nbecame acquainted late in life with the vices of others. And therefore,\\naccording to Plato, a judge should not be young, just as a young man\\naccording to Aristotle is not fit to be a hearer of moral philosophy.\\nThe bad, on the other hand, have a knowledge of vice, but no knowledge\\nof virtue. It may be doubted, however, whether this train of reflection\\nis well founded. In a remarkable passage of the Laws it is acknowledged\\nthat the evil may form a correct estimate of the good. The union of\\ngentleness and courage in Book ii. at first seemed to be a paradox, yet\\nwas afterwards ascertained to be a truth. And Plato might also have\\nfound that the intuition of evil may be consistent with the abhorrence\\nof it. There is a directness of aim in virtue which gives an insight\\ninto vice. And the knowledge of character is in some degree a natural\\nsense independent of any special experience of good or evil.\\n\\n5. One of the most remarkable conceptions of Plato, because un-Greek\\nand also very different from anything which existed at all in his age\\nof the world, is the transposition of ranks. In the Spartan state there\\nhad been enfranchisement of Helots and degradation of citizens under\\nspecial circumstances. And in the ancient Greek aristocracies, merit\\nwas certainly recognized as one of the elements on which government was\\nbased. The founders of states were supposed to be their benefactors,\\nwho were raised by their great actions above the ordinary level of\\nhumanity; at a later period, the services of warriors and legislators\\nwere held to entitle them and their descendants to the privileges of\\ncitizenship and to the first rank in the state. And although the\\nexistence of an ideal aristocracy is slenderly proven from the remains\\nof early Greek history, and we have a difficulty in ascribing such a\\ncharacter, however the idea may be defined, to any actual Hellenic\\nstate—or indeed to any state which has ever existed in the world—still\\nthe rule of the best was certainly the aspiration of philosophers, who\\nprobably accommodated a good deal their views of primitive history to\\ntheir own notions of good government. Plato further insists on applying\\nto the guardians of his state a series of tests by which all those who\\nfell short of a fixed standard were either removed from the governing\\nbody, or not admitted to it; and this ‘academic’ discipline did to a\\ncertain extent prevail in Greek states, especially in Sparta. He also\\nindicates that the system of caste, which existed in a great part of\\nthe ancient, and is by no means extinct in the modern European world,\\nshould be set aside from time to time in favour of merit. He is aware\\nhow deeply the greater part of mankind resent any interference with the\\norder of society, and therefore he proposes his novel idea in the form\\nof what he himself calls a ‘monstrous fiction.’ (Compare the ceremony\\nof preparation for the two ‘great waves’ in Book v.) Two principles are\\nindicated by him: first, that there is a distinction of ranks dependent\\non circumstances prior to the individual: second, that this distinction\\nis and ought to be broken through by personal qualities. He adapts\\nmythology like the Homeric poems to the wants of the state, making ‘the\\nPhoenician tale’ the vehicle of his ideas. Every Greek state had a myth\\nrespecting its own origin; the Platonic republic may also have a tale\\nof earthborn men. The gravity and verisimilitude with which the tale is\\ntold, and the analogy of Greek tradition, are a sufficient verification\\nof the ‘monstrous falsehood.’ Ancient poetry had spoken of a gold and\\nsilver and brass and iron age succeeding one another, but Plato\\nsupposes these differences in the natures of men to exist together in a\\nsingle state. Mythology supplies a figure under which the lesson may be\\ntaught (as Protagoras says, ‘the myth is more interesting’), and also\\nenables Plato to touch lightly on new principles without going into\\ndetails. In this passage he shadows forth a general truth, but he does\\nnot tell us by what steps the transposition of ranks is to be effected.\\nIndeed throughout the Republic he allows the lower ranks to fade into\\nthe distance. We do not know whether they are to carry arms, and\\nwhether in the fifth book they are or are not included in the\\ncommunistic regulations respecting property and marriage. Nor is there\\nany use in arguing strictly either from a few chance words, or from the\\nsilence of Plato, or in drawing inferences which were beyond his\\nvision. Aristotle, in his criticism on the position of the lower\\nclasses, does not perceive that the poetical creation is ‘like the air,\\ninvulnerable,’ and cannot be penetrated by the shafts of his logic\\n(Pol.).\\n\\n6. Two paradoxes which strike the modern reader as in the highest\\ndegree fanciful and ideal, and which suggest to him many reflections,\\nare to be found in the third book of the Republic: first, the great\\npower of music, so much beyond any influence which is experienced by us\\nin modern times, when the art or science has been far more developed,\\nand has found the secret of harmony, as well as of melody; secondly,\\nthe indefinite and almost absolute control which the soul is supposed\\nto exercise over the body.\\n\\nIn the first we suspect some degree of exaggeration, such as we may\\nalso observe among certain masters of the art, not unknown to us, at\\nthe present day. With this natural enthusiasm, which is felt by a few\\nonly, there seems to mingle in Plato a sort of Pythagorean reverence\\nfor numbers and numerical proportion to which Aristotle is a stranger.\\nIntervals of sound and number are to him sacred things which have a law\\nof their own, not dependent on the variations of sense. They rise above\\nsense, and become a connecting link with the world of ideas. But it is\\nevident that Plato is describing what to him appears to be also a fact.\\nThe power of a simple and characteristic melody on the impressible mind\\nof the Greek is more than we can easily appreciate. The effect of\\nnational airs may bear some comparison with it. And, besides all this,\\nthere is a confusion between the harmony of musical notes and the\\nharmony of soul and body, which is so potently inspired by them.\\n\\nThe second paradox leads up to some curious and interesting\\nquestions—How far can the mind control the body? Is the relation\\nbetween them one of mutual antagonism or of mutual harmony? Are they\\ntwo or one, and is either of them the cause of the other? May we not at\\ntimes drop the opposition between them, and the mode of describing\\nthem, which is so familiar to us, and yet hardly conveys any precise\\nmeaning, and try to view this composite creature, man, in a more simple\\nmanner? Must we not at any rate admit that there is in human nature a\\nhigher and a lower principle, divided by no distinct line, which at\\ntimes break asunder and take up arms against one another? Or again,\\nthey are reconciled and move together, either unconsciously in the\\nordinary work of life, or consciously in the pursuit of some noble aim,\\nto be attained not without an effort, and for which every thought and\\nnerve are strained. And then the body becomes the good friend or ally,\\nor servant or instrument of the mind. And the mind has often a\\nwonderful and almost superhuman power of banishing disease and weakness\\nand calling out a hidden strength. Reason and the desires, the\\nintellect and the senses are brought into harmony and obedience so as\\nto form a single human being. They are ever parting, ever meeting; and\\nthe identity or diversity of their tendencies or operations is for the\\nmost part unnoticed by us. When the mind touches the body through the\\nappetites, we acknowledge the responsibility of the one to the other.\\nThere is a tendency in us which says ‘Drink.’ There is another which\\nsays, ‘Do not drink; it is not good for you.’ And we all of us know\\nwhich is the rightful superior. We are also responsible for our health,\\nalthough into this sphere there enter some elements of necessity which\\nmay be beyond our control. Still even in the management of health, care\\nand thought, continued over many years, may make us almost free agents,\\nif we do not exact too much of ourselves, and if we acknowledge that\\nall human freedom is limited by the laws of nature and of mind.\\n\\nWe are disappointed to find that Plato, in the general condemnation\\nwhich he passes on the practice of medicine prevailing in his own day,\\ndepreciates the effects of diet. He would like to have diseases of a\\ndefinite character and capable of receiving a definite treatment. He is\\nafraid of invalidism interfering with the business of life. He does not\\nrecognize that time is the great healer both of mental and bodily\\ndisorders; and that remedies which are gradual and proceed little by\\nlittle are safer than those which produce a sudden catastrophe. Neither\\ndoes he see that there is no way in which the mind can more surely\\ninfluence the body than by the control of eating and drinking; or any\\nother action or occasion of human life on which the higher freedom of\\nthe will can be more simple or truly asserted.\\n\\n7. Lesser matters of style may be remarked.\\n\\n(1) The affected ignorance of music, which is Plato’s way of expressing\\nthat he is passing lightly over the subject.\\n\\n(2) The tentative manner in which here, as in the second book, he\\nproceeds with the construction of the State.\\n\\n(3) The description of the State sometimes as a reality, and then again\\nas a work of imagination only; these are the arts by which he sustains\\nthe reader’s interest.\\n\\n(4) Connecting links, or the preparation for the entire expulsion of\\nthe poets in Book X.\\n\\n(5) The companion pictures of the lover of litigation and the\\nvaletudinarian, the satirical jest about the maxim of Phocylides, the\\nmanner in which the image of the gold and silver citizens is taken up\\ninto the subject, and the argument from the practice of Asclepius,\\nshould not escape notice.\\n\\nBOOK IV. Adeimantus said: ‘Suppose a person to argue, Socrates, that\\nyou make your citizens miserable, and this by their own free-will; they\\nare the lords of the city, and yet instead of having, like other men,\\nlands and houses and money of their own, they live as mercenaries and\\nare always mounting guard.’ You may add, I replied, that they receive\\nno pay but only their food, and have no money to spend on a journey or\\na mistress. ‘Well, and what answer do you give?’ My answer is, that our\\nguardians may or may not be the happiest of men,—I should not be\\nsurprised to find in the long-run that they were,—but this is not the\\naim of our constitution, which was designed for the good of the whole\\nand not of any one part. If I went to a sculptor and blamed him for\\nhaving painted the eye, which is the noblest feature of the face, not\\npurple but black, he would reply: ‘The eye must be an eye, and you\\nshould look at the statue as a whole.’ ‘Now I can well imagine a fool’s\\nparadise, in which everybody is eating and drinking, clothed in purple\\nand fine linen, and potters lie on sofas and have their wheel at hand,\\nthat they may work a little when they please; and cobblers and all the\\nother classes of a State lose their distinctive character. And a State\\nmay get on without cobblers; but when the guardians degenerate into\\nboon companions, then the ruin is complete. Remember that we are not\\ntalking of peasants keeping holiday, but of a State in which every man\\nis expected to do his own work. The happiness resides not in this or\\nthat class, but in the State as a whole. I have another remark to\\nmake:—A middle condition is best for artisans; they should have money\\nenough to buy tools, and not enough to be independent of business. And\\nwill not the same condition be best for our citizens? If they are poor,\\nthey will be mean; if rich, luxurious and lazy; and in neither case\\ncontented. ‘But then how will our poor city be able to go to war\\nagainst an enemy who has money?’ There may be a difficulty in fighting\\nagainst one enemy; against two there will be none. In the first place,\\nthe contest will be carried on by trained warriors against well-to-do\\ncitizens: and is not a regular athlete an easy match for two stout\\nopponents at least? Suppose also, that before engaging we send\\nambassadors to one of the two cities, saying, ‘Silver and gold we have\\nnot; do you help us and take our share of the spoil;’—who would fight\\nagainst the lean, wiry dogs, when they might join with them in preying\\nupon the fatted sheep? ‘But if many states join their resources, shall\\nwe not be in danger?’ I am amused to hear you use the word ‘state’ of\\nany but our own State. They are ‘states,’ but not ‘a state’—many in\\none. For in every state there are two hostile nations, rich and poor,\\nwhich you may set one against the other. But our State, while she\\nremains true to her principles, will be in very deed the mightiest of\\nHellenic states.\\n\\nTo the size of the state there is no limit but the necessity of unity;\\nit must be neither too large nor too small to be one. This is a matter\\nof secondary importance, like the principle of transposition which was\\nintimated in the parable of the earthborn men. The meaning there\\nimplied was that every man should do that for which he was fitted, and\\nbe at one with himself, and then the whole city would be united. But\\nall these things are secondary, if education, which is the great\\nmatter, be duly regarded. When the wheel has once been set in motion,\\nthe speed is always increasing; and each generation improves upon the\\npreceding, both in physical and moral qualities. The care of the\\ngovernors should be directed to preserve music and gymnastic from\\ninnovation; alter the songs of a country, Damon says, and you will soon\\nend by altering its laws. The change appears innocent at first, and\\nbegins in play; but the evil soon becomes serious, working secretly\\nupon the characters of individuals, then upon social and commercial\\nrelations, and lastly upon the institutions of a state; and there is\\nruin and confusion everywhere. But if education remains in the\\nestablished form, there will be no danger. A restorative process will\\nbe always going on; the spirit of law and order will raise up what has\\nfallen down. Nor will any regulations be needed for the lesser matters\\nof life—rules of deportment or fashions of dress. Like invites like for\\ngood or for evil. Education will correct deficiencies and supply the\\npower of self-government. Far be it from us to enter into the\\nparticulars of legislation; let the guardians take care of education,\\nand education will take care of all other things.\\n\\nBut without education they may patch and mend as they please; they will\\nmake no progress, any more than a patient who thinks to cure himself by\\nsome favourite remedy and will not give up his luxurious mode of\\nliving. If you tell such persons that they must first alter their\\nhabits, then they grow angry; they are charming people. ‘Charming,—nay,\\nthe very reverse.’ Evidently these gentlemen are not in your good\\ngraces, nor the state which is like them. And such states there are\\nwhich first ordain under penalty of death that no one shall alter the\\nconstitution, and then suffer themselves to be flattered into and out\\nof anything; and he who indulges them and fawns upon them, is their\\nleader and saviour. ‘Yes, the men are as bad as the states.’ But do you\\nnot admire their cleverness? ‘Nay, some of them are stupid enough to\\nbelieve what the people tell them.’ And when all the world is telling a\\nman that he is six feet high, and he has no measure, how can he believe\\nanything else? But don’t get into a passion: to see our statesmen\\ntrying their nostrums, and fancying that they can cut off at a blow the\\nHydra-like rogueries of mankind, is as good as a play. Minute\\nenactments are superfluous in good states, and are useless in bad ones.\\n\\nAnd now what remains of the work of legislation? Nothing for us; but to\\nApollo the god of Delphi we leave the ordering of the greatest of all\\nthings—that is to say, religion. Only our ancestral deity sitting upon\\nthe centre and navel of the earth will be trusted by us if we have any\\nsense, in an affair of such magnitude. No foreign god shall be supreme\\nin our realms...\\n\\nHere, as Socrates would say, let us ‘reflect on’ (Greek) what has\\npreceded: thus far we have spoken not of the happiness of the citizens,\\nbut only of the well-being of the State. They may be the happiest of\\nmen, but our principal aim in founding the State was not to make them\\nhappy. They were to be guardians, not holiday-makers. In this pleasant\\nmanner is presented to us the famous question both of ancient and\\nmodern philosophy, touching the relation of duty to happiness, of right\\nto utility.\\n\\nFirst duty, then happiness, is the natural order of our moral ideas.\\nThe utilitarian principle is valuable as a corrective of error, and\\nshows to us a side of ethics which is apt to be neglected. It may be\\nadmitted further that right and utility are co-extensive, and that he\\nwho makes the happiness of mankind his object has one of the highest\\nand noblest motives of human action. But utility is not the historical\\nbasis of morality; nor the aspect in which moral and religious ideas\\ncommonly occur to the mind. The greatest happiness of all is, as we\\nbelieve, the far-off result of the divine government of the universe.\\nThe greatest happiness of the individual is certainly to be found in a\\nlife of virtue and goodness. But we seem to be more assured of a law of\\nright than we can be of a divine purpose, that ‘all mankind should be\\nsaved;’ and we infer the one from the other. And the greatest happiness\\nof the individual may be the reverse of the greatest happiness in the\\nordinary sense of the term, and may be realised in a life of pain, or\\nin a voluntary death. Further, the word ‘happiness’ has several\\nambiguities; it may mean either pleasure or an ideal life, happiness\\nsubjective or objective, in this world or in another, of ourselves only\\nor of our neighbours and of all men everywhere. By the modern founder\\nof Utilitarianism the self-regarding and disinterested motives of\\naction are included under the same term, although they are commonly\\nopposed by us as benevolence and self-love. The word happiness has not\\nthe definiteness or the sacredness of ‘truth’ and ‘right’; it does not\\nequally appeal to our higher nature, and has not sunk into the\\nconscience of mankind. It is associated too much with the comforts and\\nconveniences of life; too little with ‘the goods of the soul which we\\ndesire for their own sake.’ In a great trial, or danger, or temptation,\\nor in any great and heroic action, it is scarcely thought of. For these\\nreasons ‘the greatest happiness’ principle is not the true foundation\\nof ethics. But though not the first principle, it is the second, which\\nis like unto it, and is often of easier application. For the larger\\npart of human actions are neither right nor wrong, except in so far as\\nthey tend to the happiness of mankind (Introd. to Gorgias and\\nPhilebus).\\n\\nThe same question reappears in politics, where the useful or expedient\\nseems to claim a larger sphere and to have a greater authority. For\\nconcerning political measures, we chiefly ask: How will they affect the\\nhappiness of mankind? Yet here too we may observe that what we term\\nexpediency is merely the law of right limited by the conditions of\\nhuman society. Right and truth are the highest aims of government as\\nwell as of individuals; and we ought not to lose sight of them because\\nwe cannot directly enforce them. They appeal to the better mind of\\nnations; and sometimes they are too much for merely temporal interests\\nto resist. They are the watchwords which all men use in matters of\\npublic policy, as well as in their private dealings; the peace of\\nEurope may be said to depend upon them. In the most commercial and\\nutilitarian states of society the power of ideas remains. And all the\\nhigher class of statesmen have in them something of that idealism which\\nPericles is said to have gathered from the teaching of Anaxagoras. They\\nrecognise that the true leader of men must be above the motives of\\nambition, and that national character is of greater value than material\\ncomfort and prosperity. And this is the order of thought in Plato;\\nfirst, he expects his citizens to do their duty, and then under\\nfavourable circumstances, that is to say, in a well-ordered State,\\ntheir happiness is assured. That he was far from excluding the modern\\nprinciple of utility in politics is sufficiently evident from other\\npassages; in which ‘the most beneficial is affirmed to be the most\\nhonourable’, and also ‘the most sacred’.\\n\\nWe may note\\n\\n(1) The manner in which the objection of Adeimantus here, is designed\\nto draw out and deepen the argument of Socrates.\\n\\n(2) The conception of a whole as lying at the foundation both of\\npolitics and of art, in the latter supplying the only principle of\\ncriticism, which, under the various names of harmony, symmetry,\\nmeasure, proportion, unity, the Greek seems to have applied to works of\\nart.\\n\\n(3) The requirement that the State should be limited in size, after the\\ntraditional model of a Greek state; as in the Politics of Aristotle,\\nthe fact that the cities of Hellas were small is converted into a\\nprinciple.\\n\\n(4) The humorous pictures of the lean dogs and the fatted sheep, of the\\nlight active boxer upsetting two stout gentlemen at least, of the\\n‘charming’ patients who are always making themselves worse; or again,\\nthe playful assumption that there is no State but our own; or the grave\\nirony with which the statesman is excused who believes that he is six\\nfeet high because he is told so, and having nothing to measure with is\\nto be pardoned for his ignorance—he is too amusing for us to be\\nseriously angry with him.\\n\\n(5) The light and superficial manner in which religion is passed over\\nwhen provision has been made for two great principles,—first, that\\nreligion shall be based on the highest conception of the gods,\\nsecondly, that the true national or Hellenic type shall be\\nmaintained...\\n\\nSocrates proceeds: But where amid all this is justice? Son of Ariston,\\ntell me where. Light a candle and search the city, and get your brother\\nand the rest of our friends to help in seeking for her. ‘That won’t\\ndo,’ replied Glaucon, ‘you yourself promised to make the search and\\ntalked about the impiety of deserting justice.’ Well, I said, I will\\nlead the way, but do you follow. My notion is, that our State being\\nperfect will contain all the four virtues—wisdom, courage, temperance,\\njustice. If we eliminate the three first, the unknown remainder will be\\njustice.\\n\\nFirst then, of wisdom: the State which we have called into being will\\nbe wise because politic. And policy is one among many kinds of\\nskill,—not the skill of the carpenter, or of the worker in metal, or of\\nthe husbandman, but the skill of him who advises about the interests of\\nthe whole State. Of such a kind is the skill of the guardians, who are\\na small class in number, far smaller than the blacksmiths; but in them\\nis concentrated the wisdom of the State. And if this small ruling class\\nhave wisdom, then the whole State will be wise.\\n\\nOur second virtue is courage, which we have no difficulty in finding in\\nanother class—that of soldiers. Courage may be defined as a sort of\\nsalvation—the never-failing salvation of the opinions which law and\\neducation have prescribed concerning dangers. You know the way in which\\ndyers first prepare the white ground and then lay on the dye of purple\\nor of any other colour. Colours dyed in this way become fixed, and no\\nsoap or lye will ever wash them out. Now the ground is education, and\\nthe laws are the colours; and if the ground is properly laid, neither\\nthe soap of pleasure nor the lye of pain or fear will ever wash them\\nout. This power which preserves right opinion about danger I would ask\\nyou to call ‘courage,’ adding the epithet ‘political’ or ‘civilized’ in\\norder to distinguish it from mere animal courage and from a higher\\ncourage which may hereafter be discussed.\\n\\nTwo virtues remain; temperance and justice. More than the preceding\\nvirtues temperance suggests the idea of harmony. Some light is thrown\\nupon the nature of this virtue by the popular description of a man as\\n‘master of himself’—which has an absurd sound, because the master is\\nalso the servant. The expression really means that the better principle\\nin a man masters the worse. There are in cities whole classes—women,\\nslaves and the like—who correspond to the worse, and a few only to the\\nbetter; and in our State the former class are held under control by the\\nlatter. Now to which of these classes does temperance belong? ‘To both\\nof them.’ And our State if any will be the abode of temperance; and we\\nwere right in describing this virtue as a harmony which is diffused\\nthrough the whole, making the dwellers in the city to be of one mind,\\nand attuning the upper and middle and lower classes like the strings of\\nan instrument, whether you suppose them to differ in wisdom, strength\\nor wealth.\\n\\nAnd now we are near the spot; let us draw in and surround the cover and\\nwatch with all our eyes, lest justice should slip away and escape. Tell\\nme, if you see the thicket move first. ‘Nay, I would have you lead.’\\nWell then, offer up a prayer and follow. The way is dark and difficult;\\nbut we must push on. I begin to see a track. ‘Good news.’ Why, Glaucon,\\nour dulness of scent is quite ludicrous! While we are straining our\\neyes into the distance, justice is tumbling out at our feet. We are as\\nbad as people looking for a thing which they have in their hands. Have\\nyou forgotten our old principle of the division of labour, or of every\\nman doing his own business, concerning which we spoke at the foundation\\nof the State—what but this was justice? Is there any other virtue\\nremaining which can compete with wisdom and temperance and courage in\\nthe scale of political virtue? For ‘every one having his own’ is the\\ngreat object of government; and the great object of trade is that every\\nman should do his own business. Not that there is much harm in a\\ncarpenter trying to be a cobbler, or a cobbler transforming himself\\ninto a carpenter; but great evil may arise from the cobbler leaving his\\nlast and turning into a guardian or legislator, or when a single\\nindividual is trainer, warrior, legislator, all in one. And this evil\\nis injustice, or every man doing another’s business. I do not say that\\nas yet we are in a condition to arrive at a final conclusion. For the\\ndefinition which we believe to hold good in states has still to be\\ntested by the individual. Having read the large letters we will now\\ncome back to the small. From the two together a brilliant light may be\\nstruck out...\\n\\nSocrates proceeds to discover the nature of justice by a method of\\nresidues. Each of the first three virtues corresponds to one of the\\nthree parts of the soul and one of the three classes in the State,\\nalthough the third, temperance, has more of the nature of a harmony\\nthan the first two. If there be a fourth virtue, that can only be\\nsought for in the relation of the three parts in the soul or classes in\\nthe State to one another. It is obvious and simple, and for that very\\nreason has not been found out. The modern logician will be inclined to\\nobject that ideas cannot be separated like chemical substances, but\\nthat they run into one another and may be only different aspects or\\nnames of the same thing, and such in this instance appears to be the\\ncase. For the definition here given of justice is verbally the same as\\none of the definitions of temperance given by Socrates in the\\nCharmides, which however is only provisional, and is afterwards\\nrejected. And so far from justice remaining over when the other virtues\\nare eliminated, the justice and temperance of the Republic can with\\ndifficulty be distinguished. Temperance appears to be the virtue of a\\npart only, and one of three, whereas justice is a universal virtue of\\nthe whole soul. Yet on the other hand temperance is also described as a\\nsort of harmony, and in this respect is akin to justice. Justice seems\\nto differ from temperance in degree rather than in kind; whereas\\ntemperance is the harmony of discordant elements, justice is the\\nperfect order by which all natures and classes do their own business,\\nthe right man in the right place, the division and co-operation of all\\nthe citizens. Justice, again, is a more abstract notion than the other\\nvirtues, and therefore, from Plato’s point of view, the foundation of\\nthem, to which they are referred and which in idea precedes them. The\\nproposal to omit temperance is a mere trick of style intended to avoid\\nmonotony.\\n\\nThere is a famous question discussed in one of the earlier Dialogues of\\nPlato (Protagoras; Arist. Nic. Ethics), ‘Whether the virtues are one or\\nmany?’ This receives an answer which is to the effect that there are\\nfour cardinal virtues (now for the first time brought together in\\nethical philosophy), and one supreme over the rest, which is not like\\nAristotle’s conception of universal justice, virtue relative to others,\\nbut the whole of virtue relative to the parts. To this universal\\nconception of justice or order in the first education and in the moral\\nnature of man, the still more universal conception of the good in the\\nsecond education and in the sphere of speculative knowledge seems to\\nsucceed. Both might be equally described by the terms ‘law,’ ‘order,’\\n‘harmony;’ but while the idea of good embraces ‘all time and all\\nexistence,’ the conception of justice is not extended beyond man.\\n\\n...Socrates is now going to identify the individual and the State. But\\nfirst he must prove that there are three parts of the individual soul.\\nHis argument is as follows:—Quantity makes no difference in quality.\\nThe word ‘just,’ whether applied to the individual or to the State, has\\nthe same meaning. And the term ‘justice’ implied that the same three\\nprinciples in the State and in the individual were doing their own\\nbusiness. But are they really three or one? The question is difficult,\\nand one which can hardly be solved by the methods which we are now\\nusing; but the truer and longer way would take up too much of our time.\\n‘The shorter will satisfy me.’ Well then, you would admit that the\\nqualities of states mean the qualities of the individuals who compose\\nthem? The Scythians and Thracians are passionate, our own race\\nintellectual, and the Egyptians and Phoenicians covetous, because the\\nindividual members of each have such and such a character; the\\ndifficulty is to determine whether the several principles are one or\\nthree; whether, that is to say, we reason with one part of our nature,\\ndesire with another, are angry with another, or whether the whole soul\\ncomes into play in each sort of action. This enquiry, however, requires\\na very exact definition of terms. The same thing in the same relation\\ncannot be affected in two opposite ways. But there is no impossibility\\nin a man standing still, yet moving his arms, or in a top which is\\nfixed on one spot going round upon its axis. There is no necessity to\\nmention all the possible exceptions; let us provisionally assume that\\nopposites cannot do or be or suffer opposites in the same relation. And\\nto the class of opposites belong assent and dissent, desire and\\navoidance. And one form of desire is thirst and hunger: and here arises\\na new point—thirst is thirst of drink, hunger is hunger of food; not of\\nwarm drink or of a particular kind of food, with the single exception\\nof course that the very fact of our desiring anything implies that it\\nis good. When relative terms have no attributes, their correlatives\\nhave no attributes; when they have attributes, their correlatives also\\nhave them. For example, the term ‘greater’ is simply relative to\\n‘less,’ and knowledge refers to a subject of knowledge. But on the\\nother hand, a particular knowledge is of a particular subject. Again,\\nevery science has a distinct character, which is defined by an object;\\nmedicine, for example, is the science of health, although not to be\\nconfounded with health. Having cleared our ideas thus far, let us\\nreturn to the original instance of thirst, which has a definite\\nobject—drink. Now the thirsty soul may feel two distinct impulses; the\\nanimal one saying ‘Drink;’ the rational one, which says ‘Do not drink.’\\nThe two impulses are contradictory; and therefore we may assume that\\nthey spring from distinct principles in the soul. But is passion a\\nthird principle, or akin to desire? There is a story of a certain\\nLeontius which throws some light on this question. He was coming up\\nfrom the Piraeus outside the north wall, and he passed a spot where\\nthere were dead bodies lying by the executioner. He felt a longing\\ndesire to see them and also an abhorrence of them; at first he turned\\naway and shut his eyes, then, suddenly tearing them open, he\\nsaid,—‘Take your fill, ye wretches, of the fair sight.’ Now is there\\nnot here a third principle which is often found to come to the\\nassistance of reason against desire, but never of desire against\\nreason? This is passion or spirit, of the separate existence of which\\nwe may further convince ourselves by putting the following case:—When a\\nman suffers justly, if he be of a generous nature he is not indignant\\nat the hardships which he undergoes: but when he suffers unjustly, his\\nindignation is his great support; hunger and thirst cannot tame him;\\nthe spirit within him must do or die, until the voice of the shepherd,\\nthat is, of reason, bidding his dog bark no more, is heard within. This\\nshows that passion is the ally of reason. Is passion then the same with\\nreason? No, for the former exists in children and brutes; and Homer\\naffords a proof of the distinction between them when he says, ‘He smote\\nhis breast, and thus rebuked his soul.’\\n\\nAnd now, at last, we have reached firm ground, and are able to infer\\nthat the virtues of the State and of the individual are the same. For\\nwisdom and courage and justice in the State are severally the wisdom\\nand courage and justice in the individuals who form the State. Each of\\nthe three classes will do the work of its own class in the State, and\\neach part in the individual soul; reason, the superior, and passion,\\nthe inferior, will be harmonized by the influence of music and\\ngymnastic. The counsellor and the warrior, the head and the arm, will\\nact together in the town of Mansoul, and keep the desires in proper\\nsubjection. The courage of the warrior is that quality which preserves\\na right opinion about dangers in spite of pleasures and pains. The\\nwisdom of the counsellor is that small part of the soul which has\\nauthority and reason. The virtue of temperance is the friendship of the\\nruling and the subject principles, both in the State and in the\\nindividual. Of justice we have already spoken; and the notion already\\ngiven of it may be confirmed by common instances. Will the just state\\nor the just individual steal, lie, commit adultery, or be guilty of\\nimpiety to gods and men? ‘No.’ And is not the reason of this that the\\nseveral principles, whether in the state or in the individual, do their\\nown business? And justice is the quality which makes just men and just\\nstates. Moreover, our old division of labour, which required that there\\nshould be one man for one use, was a dream or anticipation of what was\\nto follow; and that dream has now been realized in justice, which\\nbegins by binding together the three chords of the soul, and then acts\\nharmoniously in every relation of life. And injustice, which is the\\ninsubordination and disobedience of the inferior elements in the soul,\\nis the opposite of justice, and is inharmonious and unnatural, being to\\nthe soul what disease is to the body; for in the soul as well as in the\\nbody, good or bad actions produce good or bad habits. And virtue is the\\nhealth and beauty and well-being of the soul, and vice is the disease\\nand weakness and deformity of the soul.\\n\\nAgain the old question returns upon us: Is justice or injustice the\\nmore profitable? The question has become ridiculous. For injustice,\\nlike mortal disease, makes life not worth having. Come up with me to\\nthe hill which overhangs the city and look down upon the single form of\\nvirtue, and the infinite forms of vice, among which are four special\\nones, characteristic both of states and of individuals. And the state\\nwhich corresponds to the single form of virtue is that which we have\\nbeen describing, wherein reason rules under one of two names—monarchy\\nand aristocracy. Thus there are five forms in all, both of states and\\nof souls...\\n\\nIn attempting to prove that the soul has three separate faculties,\\nPlato takes occasion to discuss what makes difference of faculties. And\\nthe criterion which he proposes is difference in the working of the\\nfaculties. The same faculty cannot produce contradictory effects. But\\nthe path of early reasoners is beset by thorny entanglements, and he\\nwill not proceed a step without first clearing the ground. This leads\\nhim into a tiresome digression, which is intended to explain the nature\\nof contradiction. First, the contradiction must be at the same time and\\nin the same relation. Secondly, no extraneous word must be introduced\\ninto either of the terms in which the contradictory proposition is\\nexpressed: for example, thirst is of drink, not of warm drink. He\\nimplies, what he does not say, that if, by the advice of reason, or by\\nthe impulse of anger, a man is restrained from drinking, this proves\\nthat thirst, or desire under which thirst is included, is distinct from\\nanger and reason. But suppose that we allow the term ‘thirst’ or\\n‘desire’ to be modified, and say an ‘angry thirst,’ or a ‘revengeful\\ndesire,’ then the two spheres of desire and anger overlap and become\\nconfused. This case therefore has to be excluded. And still there\\nremains an exception to the rule in the use of the term ‘good,’ which\\nis always implied in the object of desire. These are the discussions of\\nan age before logic; and any one who is wearied by them should remember\\nthat they are necessary to the clearing up of ideas in the first\\ndevelopment of the human faculties.\\n\\nThe psychology of Plato extends no further than the division of the\\nsoul into the rational, irascible, and concupiscent elements, which, as\\nfar as we know, was first made by him, and has been retained by\\nAristotle and succeeding ethical writers. The chief difficulty in this\\nearly analysis of the mind is to define exactly the place of the\\nirascible faculty (Greek), which may be variously described under the\\nterms righteous indignation, spirit, passion. It is the foundation of\\ncourage, which includes in Plato moral courage, the courage of enduring\\npain, and of surmounting intellectual difficulties, as well as of\\nmeeting dangers in war. Though irrational, it inclines to side with the\\nrational: it cannot be aroused by punishment when justly inflicted: it\\nsometimes takes the form of an enthusiasm which sustains a man in the\\nperformance of great actions. It is the ‘lion heart’ with which the\\nreason makes a treaty. On the other hand it is negative rather than\\npositive; it is indignant at wrong or falsehood, but does not, like\\nLove in the Symposium and Phaedrus, aspire to the vision of Truth or\\nGood. It is the peremptory military spirit which prevails in the\\ngovernment of honour. It differs from anger (Greek), this latter term\\nhaving no accessory notion of righteous indignation. Although Aristotle\\nhas retained the word, yet we may observe that ‘passion’ (Greek) has\\nwith him lost its affinity to the rational and has become\\nindistinguishable from ‘anger’ (Greek). And to this vernacular use\\nPlato himself in the Laws seems to revert, though not always. By modern\\nphilosophy too, as well as in our ordinary conversation, the words\\nanger or passion are employed almost exclusively in a bad sense; there\\nis no connotation of a just or reasonable cause by which they are\\naroused. The feeling of ‘righteous indignation’ is too partial and\\naccidental to admit of our regarding it as a separate virtue or habit.\\nWe are tempted also to doubt whether Plato is right in supposing that\\nan offender, however justly condemned, could be expected to acknowledge\\nthe justice of his sentence; this is the spirit of a philosopher or\\nmartyr rather than of a criminal.\\n\\nWe may observe how nearly Plato approaches Aristotle’s famous thesis,\\nthat ‘good actions produce good habits.’ The words ‘as healthy\\npractices (Greek) produce health, so do just practices produce\\njustice,’ have a sound very like the Nicomachean Ethics. But we note\\nalso that an incidental remark in Plato has become a far-reaching\\nprinciple in Aristotle, and an inseparable part of a great Ethical\\nsystem.\\n\\nThere is a difficulty in understanding what Plato meant by ‘the longer\\nway’: he seems to intimate some metaphysic of the future which will not\\nbe satisfied with arguing from the principle of contradiction. In the\\nsixth and seventh books (compare Sophist and Parmenides) he has given\\nus a sketch of such a metaphysic; but when Glaucon asks for the final\\nrevelation of the idea of good, he is put off with the declaration that\\nhe has not yet studied the preliminary sciences. How he would have\\nfilled up the sketch, or argued about such questions from a higher\\npoint of view, we can only conjecture. Perhaps he hoped to find some a\\npriori method of developing the parts out of the whole; or he might\\nhave asked which of the ideas contains the other ideas, and possibly\\nhave stumbled on the Hegelian identity of the ‘ego’ and the\\n‘universal.’ Or he may have imagined that ideas might be constructed in\\nsome manner analogous to the construction of figures and numbers in the\\nmathematical sciences. The most certain and necessary truth was to\\nPlato the universal; and to this he was always seeking to refer all\\nknowledge or opinion, just as in modern times we seek to rest them on\\nthe opposite pole of induction and experience. The aspirations of\\nmetaphysicians have always tended to pass beyond the limits of human\\nthought and language: they seem to have reached a height at which they\\nare ‘moving about in worlds unrealized,’ and their conceptions,\\nalthough profoundly affecting their own minds, become invisible or\\nunintelligible to others. We are not therefore surprized to find that\\nPlato himself has nowhere clearly explained his doctrine of ideas; or\\nthat his school in a later generation, like his contemporaries Glaucon\\nand Adeimantus, were unable to follow him in this region of\\nspeculation. In the Sophist, where he is refuting the scepticism which\\nmaintained either that there was no such thing as predication, or that\\nall might be predicated of all, he arrives at the conclusion that some\\nideas combine with some, but not all with all. But he makes only one or\\ntwo steps forward on this path; he nowhere attains to any connected\\nsystem of ideas, or even to a knowledge of the most elementary\\nrelations of the sciences to one another.\\n\\nBOOK V. I was going to enumerate the four forms of vice or decline in\\nstates, when Polemarchus—he was sitting a little farther from me than\\nAdeimantus—taking him by the coat and leaning towards him, said\\nsomething in an undertone, of which I only caught the words, ‘Shall we\\nlet him off?’ ‘Certainly not,’ said Adeimantus, raising his voice.\\nWhom, I said, are you not going to let off? ‘You,’ he said. Why?\\n‘Because we think that you are not dealing fairly with us in omitting\\nwomen and children, of whom you have slily disposed under the general\\nformula that friends have all things in common.’ And was I not right?\\n‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘but there are many sorts of communism or community,\\nand we want to know which of them is right. The company, as you have\\njust heard, are resolved to have a further explanation.’ Thrasymachus\\nsaid, ‘Do you think that we have come hither to dig for gold, or to\\nhear you discourse?’ Yes, I said; but the discourse should be of a\\nreasonable length. Glaucon added, ‘Yes, Socrates, and there is reason\\nin spending the whole of life in such discussions; but pray, without\\nmore ado, tell us how this community is to be carried out, and how the\\ninterval between birth and education is to be filled up.’ Well, I said,\\nthe subject has several difficulties—What is possible? is the first\\nquestion. What is desirable? is the second. ‘Fear not,’ he replied,\\n‘for you are speaking among friends.’ That, I replied, is a sorry\\nconsolation; I shall destroy my friends as well as myself. Not that I\\nmind a little innocent laughter; but he who kills the truth is a\\nmurderer. ‘Then,’ said Glaucon, laughing, ‘in case you should murder us\\nwe will acquit you beforehand, and you shall be held free from the\\nguilt of deceiving us.’\\n\\nSocrates proceeds:—The guardians of our state are to be watch-dogs, as\\nwe have already said. Now dogs are not divided into hes and shes—we do\\nnot take the masculine gender out to hunt and leave the females at home\\nto look after their puppies. They have the same employments—the only\\ndifference between them is that the one sex is stronger and the other\\nweaker. But if women are to have the same employments as men, they must\\nhave the same education—they must be taught music and gymnastics, and\\nthe art of war. I know that a great joke will be made of their riding\\non horseback and carrying weapons; the sight of the naked old wrinkled\\nwomen showing their agility in the palaestra will certainly not be a\\nvision of beauty, and may be expected to become a famous jest. But we\\nmust not mind the wits; there was a time when they might have laughed\\nat our present gymnastics. All is habit: people have at last found out\\nthat the exposure is better than the concealment of the person, and now\\nthey laugh no more. Evil only should be the subject of ridicule.\\n\\nThe first question is, whether women are able either wholly or\\npartially to share in the employments of men. And here we may be\\ncharged with inconsistency in making the proposal at all. For we\\nstarted originally with the division of labour; and the diversity of\\nemployments was based on the difference of natures. But is there no\\ndifference between men and women? Nay, are they not wholly different?\\nTHERE was the difficulty, Glaucon, which made me unwilling to speak of\\nfamily relations. However, when a man is out of his depth, whether in a\\npool or in an ocean, he can only swim for his life; and we must try to\\nfind a way of escape, if we can.\\n\\nThe argument is, that different natures have different uses, and the\\nnatures of men and women are said to differ. But this is only a verbal\\nopposition. We do not consider that the difference may be purely\\nnominal and accidental; for example, a bald man and a hairy man are\\nopposed in a single point of view, but you cannot infer that because a\\nbald man is a cobbler a hairy man ought not to be a cobbler. Now why is\\nsuch an inference erroneous? Simply because the opposition between them\\nis partial only, like the difference between a male physician and a\\nfemale physician, not running through the whole nature, like the\\ndifference between a physician and a carpenter. And if the difference\\nof the sexes is only that the one beget and the other bear children,\\nthis does not prove that they ought to have distinct educations.\\nAdmitting that women differ from men in capacity, do not men equally\\ndiffer from one another? Has not nature scattered all the qualities\\nwhich our citizens require indifferently up and down among the two\\nsexes? and even in their peculiar pursuits, are not women often, though\\nin some cases superior to men, ridiculously enough surpassed by them?\\nWomen are the same in kind as men, and have the same aptitude or want\\nof aptitude for medicine or gymnastic or war, but in a less degree. One\\nwoman will be a good guardian, another not; and the good must be chosen\\nto be the colleagues of our guardians. If however their natures are the\\nsame, the inference is that their education must also be the same;\\nthere is no longer anything unnatural or impossible in a woman learning\\nmusic and gymnastic. And the education which we give them will be the\\nvery best, far superior to that of cobblers, and will train up the very\\nbest women, and nothing can be more advantageous to the State than\\nthis. Therefore let them strip, clothed in their chastity, and share in\\nthe toils of war and in the defence of their country; he who laughs at\\nthem is a fool for his pains.\\n\\nThe first wave is past, and the argument is compelled to admit that men\\nand women have common duties and pursuits. A second and greater wave is\\nrolling in—community of wives and children; is this either expedient or\\npossible? The expediency I do not doubt; I am not so sure of the\\npossibility. ‘Nay, I think that a considerable doubt will be\\nentertained on both points.’ I meant to have escaped the trouble of\\nproving the first, but as you have detected the little stratagem I must\\neven submit. Only allow me to feed my fancy like the solitary in his\\nwalks, with a dream of what might be, and then I will return to the\\nquestion of what can be.\\n\\nIn the first place our rulers will enforce the laws and make new ones\\nwhere they are wanted, and their allies or ministers will obey. You, as\\nlegislator, have already selected the men; and now you shall select the\\nwomen. After the selection has been made, they will dwell in common\\nhouses and have their meals in common, and will be brought together by\\na necessity more certain than that of mathematics. But they cannot be\\nallowed to live in licentiousness; that is an unholy thing, which the\\nrulers are determined to prevent. For the avoidance of this, holy\\nmarriage festivals will be instituted, and their holiness will be in\\nproportion to their usefulness. And here, Glaucon, I should like to ask\\n(as I know that you are a breeder of birds and animals), Do you not\\ntake the greatest care in the mating? ‘Certainly.’ And there is no\\nreason to suppose that less care is required in the marriage of human\\nbeings. But then our rulers must be skilful physicians of the State,\\nfor they will often need a strong dose of falsehood in order to bring\\nabout desirable unions between their subjects. The good must be paired\\nwith the good, and the bad with the bad, and the offspring of the one\\nmust be reared, and of the other destroyed; in this way the flock will\\nbe preserved in prime condition. Hymeneal festivals will be celebrated\\nat times fixed with an eye to population, and the brides and\\nbridegrooms will meet at them; and by an ingenious system of lots the\\nrulers will contrive that the brave and the fair come together, and\\nthat those of inferior breed are paired with inferiors—the latter will\\nascribe to chance what is really the invention of the rulers. And when\\nchildren are born, the offspring of the brave and fair will be carried\\nto an enclosure in a certain part of the city, and there attended by\\nsuitable nurses; the rest will be hurried away to places unknown. The\\nmothers will be brought to the fold and will suckle the children; care\\nhowever must be taken that none of them recognise their own offspring;\\nand if necessary other nurses may also be hired. The trouble of\\nwatching and getting up at night will be transferred to attendants.\\n‘Then the wives of our guardians will have a fine easy time when they\\nare having children.’ And quite right too, I said, that they should.\\n\\nThe parents ought to be in the prime of life, which for a man may be\\nreckoned at thirty years—from twenty-five, when he has ‘passed the\\npoint at which the speed of life is greatest,’ to fifty-five; and at\\ntwenty years for a woman—from twenty to forty. Any one above or below\\nthose ages who partakes in the hymeneals shall be guilty of impiety;\\nalso every one who forms a marriage connexion at other times without\\nthe consent of the rulers. This latter regulation applies to those who\\nare within the specified ages, after which they may range at will,\\nprovided they avoid the prohibited degrees of parents and children, or\\nof brothers and sisters, which last, however, are not absolutely\\nprohibited, if a dispensation be procured. ‘But how shall we know the\\ndegrees of affinity, when all things are common?’ The answer is, that\\nbrothers and sisters are all such as are born seven or nine months\\nafter the espousals, and their parents those who are then espoused, and\\nevery one will have many children and every child many parents.\\n\\nSocrates proceeds: I have now to prove that this scheme is advantageous\\nand also consistent with our entire polity. The greatest good of a\\nState is unity; the greatest evil, discord and distraction. And there\\nwill be unity where there are no private pleasures or pains or\\ninterests—where if one member suffers all the members suffer, if one\\ncitizen is touched all are quickly sensitive; and the least hurt to the\\nlittle finger of the State runs through the whole body and vibrates to\\nthe soul. For the true State, like an individual, is injured as a whole\\nwhen any part is affected. Every State has subjects and rulers, who in\\na democracy are called rulers, and in other States masters: but in our\\nState they are called saviours and allies; and the subjects who in\\nother States are termed slaves, are by us termed nurturers and\\npaymasters, and those who are termed comrades and colleagues in other\\nplaces, are by us called fathers and brothers. And whereas in other\\nStates members of the same government regard one of their colleagues as\\na friend and another as an enemy, in our State no man is a stranger to\\nanother; for every citizen is connected with every other by ties of\\nblood, and these names and this way of speaking will have a\\ncorresponding reality—brother, father, sister, mother, repeated from\\ninfancy in the ears of children, will not be mere words. Then again the\\ncitizens will have all things in common, in having common property they\\nwill have common pleasures and pains.\\n\\nCan there be strife and contention among those who are of one mind; or\\nlawsuits about property when men have nothing but their bodies which\\nthey call their own; or suits about violence when every one is bound to\\ndefend himself? The permission to strike when insulted will be an\\n‘antidote’ to the knife and will prevent disturbances in the State. But\\nno younger man will strike an elder; reverence will prevent him from\\nlaying hands on his kindred, and he will fear that the rest of the\\nfamily may retaliate. Moreover, our citizens will be rid of the lesser\\nevils of life; there will be no flattery of the rich, no sordid\\nhousehold cares, no borrowing and not paying. Compared with the\\ncitizens of other States, ours will be Olympic victors, and crowned\\nwith blessings greater still—they and their children having a better\\nmaintenance during life, and after death an honourable burial. Nor has\\nthe happiness of the individual been sacrificed to the happiness of the\\nState; our Olympic victor has not been turned into a cobbler, but he\\nhas a happiness beyond that of any cobbler. At the same time, if any\\nconceited youth begins to dream of appropriating the State to himself,\\nhe must be reminded that ‘half is better than the whole.’ ‘I should\\ncertainly advise him to stay where he is when he has the promise of\\nsuch a brave life.’\\n\\nBut is such a community possible?—as among the animals, so also among\\nmen; and if possible, in what way possible? About war there is no\\ndifficulty; the principle of communism is adapted to military service.\\nParents will take their children to look on at a battle, just as\\npotters’ boys are trained to the business by looking on at the wheel.\\nAnd to the parents themselves, as to other animals, the sight of their\\nyoung ones will prove a great incentive to bravery. Young warriors must\\nlearn, but they must not run into danger, although a certain degree of\\nrisk is worth incurring when the benefit is great. The young creatures\\nshould be placed under the care of experienced veterans, and they\\nshould have wings—that is to say, swift and tractable steeds on which\\nthey may fly away and escape. One of the first things to be done is to\\nteach a youth to ride.\\n\\nCowards and deserters shall be degraded to the class of husbandmen;\\ngentlemen who allow themselves to be taken prisoners, may be presented\\nto the enemy. But what shall be done to the hero? First of all he shall\\nbe crowned by all the youths in the army; secondly, he shall receive\\nthe right hand of fellowship; and thirdly, do you think that there is\\nany harm in his being kissed? We have already determined that he shall\\nhave more wives than others, in order that he may have as many children\\nas possible. And at a feast he shall have more to eat; we have the\\nauthority of Homer for honouring brave men with ‘long chines,’ which is\\nan appropriate compliment, because meat is a very strengthening thing.\\nFill the bowl then, and give the best seats and meats to the brave—may\\nthey do them good! And he who dies in battle will be at once declared\\nto be of the golden race, and will, as we believe, become one of\\nHesiod’s guardian angels. He shall be worshipped after death in the\\nmanner prescribed by the oracle; and not only he, but all other\\nbenefactors of the State who die in any other way, shall be admitted to\\nthe same honours.\\n\\nThe next question is, How shall we treat our enemies? Shall Hellenes be\\nenslaved? No; for there is too great a risk of the whole race passing\\nunder the yoke of the barbarians. Or shall the dead be despoiled?\\nCertainly not; for that sort of thing is an excuse for skulking, and\\nhas been the ruin of many an army. There is meanness and feminine\\nmalice in making an enemy of the dead body, when the soul which was the\\nowner has fled—like a dog who cannot reach his assailants, and quarrels\\nwith the stones which are thrown at him instead. Again, the arms of\\nHellenes should not be offered up in the temples of the Gods; they are\\na pollution, for they are taken from brethren. And on similar grounds\\nthere should be a limit to the devastation of Hellenic territory—the\\nhouses should not be burnt, nor more than the annual produce carried\\noff. For war is of two kinds, civil and foreign; the first of which is\\nproperly termed ‘discord,’ and only the second ‘war;’ and war between\\nHellenes is in reality civil war—a quarrel in a family, which is ever\\nto be regarded as unpatriotic and unnatural, and ought to be prosecuted\\nwith a view to reconciliation in a true phil-Hellenic spirit, as of\\nthose who would chasten but not utterly enslave. The war is not against\\na whole nation who are a friendly multitude of men, women, and\\nchildren, but only against a few guilty persons; when they are punished\\npeace will be restored. That is the way in which Hellenes should war\\nagainst one another—and against barbarians, as they war against one\\nanother now.\\n\\n‘But, my dear Socrates, you are forgetting the main question: Is such a\\nState possible? I grant all and more than you say about the blessedness\\nof being one family—fathers, brothers, mothers, daughters, going out to\\nwar together; but I want to ascertain the possibility of this ideal\\nState.’ You are too unmerciful. The first wave and the second wave I\\nhave hardly escaped, and now you will certainly drown me with the\\nthird. When you see the towering crest of the wave, I expect you to\\ntake pity. ‘Not a whit.’\\n\\nWell, then, we were led to form our ideal polity in the search after\\njustice, and the just man answered to the just State. Is this ideal at\\nall the worse for being impracticable? Would the picture of a perfectly\\nbeautiful man be any the worse because no such man ever lived? Can any\\nreality come up to the idea? Nature will not allow words to be fully\\nrealized; but if I am to try and realize the ideal of the State in a\\nmeasure, I think that an approach may be made to the perfection of\\nwhich I dream by one or two, I do not say slight, but possible changes\\nin the present constitution of States. I would reduce them to a single\\none—the great wave, as I call it. Until, then, kings are philosophers,\\nor philosophers are kings, cities will never cease from ill: no, nor\\nthe human race; nor will our ideal polity ever come into being. I know\\nthat this is a hard saying, which few will be able to receive.\\n‘Socrates, all the world will take off his coat and rush upon you with\\nsticks and stones, and therefore I would advise you to prepare an\\nanswer.’ You got me into the scrape, I said. ‘And I was right,’ he\\nreplied; ‘however, I will stand by you as a sort of do-nothing,\\nwell-meaning ally.’ Having the help of such a champion, I will do my\\nbest to maintain my position. And first, I must explain of whom I speak\\nand what sort of natures these are who are to be philosophers and\\nrulers. As you are a man of pleasure, you will not have forgotten how\\nindiscriminate lovers are in their attachments; they love all, and turn\\nblemishes into beauties. The snub-nosed youth is said to have a winning\\ngrace; the beak of another has a royal look; the featureless are\\nfaultless; the dark are manly, the fair angels; the sickly have a new\\nterm of endearment invented expressly for them, which is ‘honey-pale.’\\nLovers of wine and lovers of ambition also desire the objects of their\\naffection in every form. Now here comes the point:—The philosopher too\\nis a lover of knowledge in every form; he has an insatiable curiosity.\\n‘But will curiosity make a philosopher? Are the lovers of sights and\\nsounds, who let out their ears to every chorus at the Dionysiac\\nfestivals, to be called philosophers?’ They are not true philosophers,\\nbut only an imitation. ‘Then how are we to describe the true?’\\n\\nYou would acknowledge the existence of abstract ideas, such as justice,\\nbeauty, good, evil, which are severally one, yet in their various\\ncombinations appear to be many. Those who recognize these realities are\\nphilosophers; whereas the other class hear sounds and see colours, and\\nunderstand their use in the arts, but cannot attain to the true or\\nwaking vision of absolute justice or beauty or truth; they have not the\\nlight of knowledge, but of opinion, and what they see is a dream only.\\nPerhaps he of whom we say the last will be angry with us; can we pacify\\nhim without revealing the disorder of his mind? Suppose we say that, if\\nhe has knowledge we rejoice to hear it, but knowledge must be of\\nsomething which is, as ignorance is of something which is not; and\\nthere is a third thing, which both is and is not, and is matter of\\nopinion only. Opinion and knowledge, then, having distinct objects,\\nmust also be distinct faculties. And by faculties I mean powers unseen\\nand distinguishable only by the difference in their objects, as opinion\\nand knowledge differ, since the one is liable to err, but the other is\\nunerring and is the mightiest of all our faculties. If being is the\\nobject of knowledge, and not-being of ignorance, and these are the\\nextremes, opinion must lie between them, and may be called darker than\\nthe one and brighter than the other. This intermediate or contingent\\nmatter is and is not at the same time, and partakes both of existence\\nand of non-existence. Now I would ask my good friend, who denies\\nabstract beauty and justice, and affirms a many beautiful and a many\\njust, whether everything he sees is not in some point of view\\ndifferent—the beautiful ugly, the pious impious, the just unjust? Is\\nnot the double also the half, and are not heavy and light relative\\nterms which pass into one another? Everything is and is not, as in the\\nold riddle—‘A man and not a man shot and did not shoot a bird and not a\\nbird with a stone and not a stone.’ The mind cannot be fixed on either\\nalternative; and these ambiguous, intermediate, erring, half-lighted\\nobjects, which have a disorderly movement in the region between being\\nand not-being, are the proper matter of opinion, as the immutable\\nobjects are the proper matter of knowledge. And he who grovels in the\\nworld of sense, and has only this uncertain perception of things, is\\nnot a philosopher, but a lover of opinion only...\\n\\nThe fifth book is the new beginning of the Republic, in which the\\ncommunity of property and of family are first maintained, and the\\ntransition is made to the kingdom of philosophers. For both of these\\nPlato, after his manner, has been preparing in some chance words of\\nBook IV, which fall unperceived on the reader’s mind, as they are\\nsupposed at first to have fallen on the ear of Glaucon and Adeimantus.\\nThe ‘paradoxes,’ as Morgenstern terms them, of this book of the\\nRepublic will be reserved for another place; a few remarks on the\\nstyle, and some explanations of difficulties, may be briefly added.\\n\\nFirst, there is the image of the waves, which serves for a sort of\\nscheme or plan of the book. The first wave, the second wave, the third\\nand greatest wave come rolling in, and we hear the roar of them. All\\nthat can be said of the extravagance of Plato’s proposals is\\nanticipated by himself. Nothing is more admirable than the hesitation\\nwith which he proposes the solemn text, ‘Until kings are philosophers,’\\netc.; or the reaction from the sublime to the ridiculous, when Glaucon\\ndescribes the manner in which the new truth will be received by\\nmankind.\\n\\nSome defects and difficulties may be noted in the execution of the\\ncommunistic plan. Nothing is told us of the application of communism to\\nthe lower classes; nor is the table of prohibited degrees capable of\\nbeing made out. It is quite possible that a child born at one hymeneal\\nfestival may marry one of its own brothers or sisters, or even one of\\nits parents, at another. Plato is afraid of incestuous unions, but at\\nthe same time he does not wish to bring before us the fact that the\\ncity would be divided into families of those born seven and nine months\\nafter each hymeneal festival. If it were worth while to argue seriously\\nabout such fancies, we might remark that while all the old affinities\\nare abolished, the newly prohibited affinity rests not on any natural\\nor rational principle, but only upon the accident of children having\\nbeen born in the same month and year. Nor does he explain how the lots\\ncould be so manipulated by the legislature as to bring together the\\nfairest and best. The singular expression which is employed to describe\\nthe age of five-and-twenty may perhaps be taken from some poet.\\n\\nIn the delineation of the philosopher, the illustrations of the nature\\nof philosophy derived from love are more suited to the apprehension of\\nGlaucon, the Athenian man of pleasure, than to modern tastes or\\nfeelings. They are partly facetious, but also contain a germ of truth.\\nThat science is a whole, remains a true principle of inductive as well\\nas of metaphysical philosophy; and the love of universal knowledge is\\nstill the characteristic of the philosopher in modern as well as in\\nancient times.\\n\\nAt the end of the fifth book Plato introduces the figment of contingent\\nmatter, which has exercised so great an influence both on the Ethics\\nand Theology of the modern world, and which occurs here for the first\\ntime in the history of philosophy. He did not remark that the degrees\\nof knowledge in the subject have nothing corresponding to them in the\\nobject. With him a word must answer to an idea; and he could not\\nconceive of an opinion which was an opinion about nothing. The\\ninfluence of analogy led him to invent ‘parallels and conjugates’ and\\nto overlook facts. To us some of his difficulties are puzzling only\\nfrom their simplicity: we do not perceive that the answer to them ‘is\\ntumbling out at our feet.’ To the mind of early thinkers, the\\nconception of not-being was dark and mysterious; they did not see that\\nthis terrible apparition which threatened destruction to all knowledge\\nwas only a logical determination. The common term under which, through\\nthe accidental use of language, two entirely different ideas were\\nincluded was another source of confusion. Thus through the ambiguity of\\n(Greek) Plato, attempting to introduce order into the first chaos of\\nhuman thought, seems to have confused perception and opinion, and to\\nhave failed to distinguish the contingent from the relative. In the\\nTheaetetus the first of these difficulties begins to clear up; in the\\nSophist the second; and for this, as well as for other reasons, both\\nthese dialogues are probably to be regarded as later than the Republic.\\n\\nBOOK VI. Having determined that the many have no knowledge of true\\nbeing, and have no clear patterns in their minds of justice, beauty,\\ntruth, and that philosophers have such patterns, we have now to ask\\nwhether they or the many shall be rulers in our State. But who can\\ndoubt that philosophers should be chosen, if they have the other\\nqualities which are required in a ruler? For they are lovers of the\\nknowledge of the eternal and of all truth; they are haters of\\nfalsehood; their meaner desires are absorbed in the interests of\\nknowledge; they are spectators of all time and all existence; and in\\nthe magnificence of their contemplation the life of man is as nothing\\nto them, nor is death fearful. Also they are of a social, gracious\\ndisposition, equally free from cowardice and arrogance. They learn and\\nremember easily; they have harmonious, well-regulated minds; truth\\nflows to them sweetly by nature. Can the god of Jealousy himself find\\nany fault with such an assemblage of good qualities?\\n\\nHere Adeimantus interposes:—‘No man can answer you, Socrates; but every\\nman feels that this is owing to his own deficiency in argument. He is\\ndriven from one position to another, until he has nothing more to say,\\njust as an unskilful player at draughts is reduced to his last move by\\na more skilled opponent. And yet all the time he may be right. He may\\nknow, in this very instance, that those who make philosophy the\\nbusiness of their lives, generally turn out rogues if they are bad men,\\nand fools if they are good. What do you say?’ I should say that he is\\nquite right. ‘Then how is such an admission reconcileable with the\\ndoctrine that philosophers should be kings?’\\n\\nI shall answer you in a parable which will also let you see how poor a\\nhand I am at the invention of allegories. The relation of good men to\\ntheir governments is so peculiar, that in order to defend them I must\\ntake an illustration from the world of fiction. Conceive the captain of\\na ship, taller by a head and shoulders than any of the crew, yet a\\nlittle deaf, a little blind, and rather ignorant of the seaman’s art.\\nThe sailors want to steer, although they know nothing of the art; and\\nthey have a theory that it cannot be learned. If the helm is refused\\nthem, they drug the captain’s posset, bind him hand and foot, and take\\npossession of the ship. He who joins in the mutiny is termed a good\\npilot and what not; they have no conception that the true pilot must\\nobserve the winds and the stars, and must be their master, whether they\\nlike it or not;—such an one would be called by them fool, prater,\\nstar-gazer. This is my parable; which I will beg you to interpret for\\nme to those gentlemen who ask why the philosopher has such an evil\\nname, and to explain to them that not he, but those who will not use\\nhim, are to blame for his uselessness. The philosopher should not beg\\nof mankind to be put in authority over them. The wise man should not\\nseek the rich, as the proverb bids, but every man, whether rich or\\npoor, must knock at the door of the physician when he has need of him.\\nNow the pilot is the philosopher—he whom in the parable they call\\nstar-gazer, and the mutinous sailors are the mob of politicians by whom\\nhe is rendered useless. Not that these are the worst enemies of\\nphilosophy, who is far more dishonoured by her own professing sons when\\nthey are corrupted by the world. Need I recall the original image of\\nthe philosopher? Did we not say of him just now, that he loved truth\\nand hated falsehood, and that he could not rest in the multiplicity of\\nphenomena, but was led by a sympathy in his own nature to the\\ncontemplation of the absolute? All the virtues as well as truth, who is\\nthe leader of them, took up their abode in his soul. But as you were\\nobserving, if we turn aside to view the reality, we see that the\\npersons who were thus described, with the exception of a small and\\nuseless class, are utter rogues.\\n\\nThe point which has to be considered, is the origin of this corruption\\nin nature. Every one will admit that the philosopher, in our\\ndescription of him, is a rare being. But what numberless causes tend to\\ndestroy these rare beings! There is no good thing which may not be a\\ncause of evil—health, wealth, strength, rank, and the virtues\\nthemselves, when placed under unfavourable circumstances. For as in the\\nanimal or vegetable world the strongest seeds most need the\\naccompaniment of good air and soil, so the best of human characters\\nturn out the worst when they fall upon an unsuitable soil; whereas weak\\nnatures hardly ever do any considerable good or harm; they are not the\\nstuff out of which either great criminals or great heroes are made. The\\nphilosopher follows the same analogy: he is either the best or the\\nworst of all men. Some persons say that the Sophists are the corrupters\\nof youth; but is not public opinion the real Sophist who is everywhere\\npresent—in those very persons, in the assembly, in the courts, in the\\ncamp, in the applauses and hisses of the theatre re-echoed by the\\nsurrounding hills? Will not a young man’s heart leap amid these\\ndiscordant sounds? and will any education save him from being carried\\naway by the torrent? Nor is this all. For if he will not yield to\\nopinion, there follows the gentle compulsion of exile or death. What\\nprinciple of rival Sophists or anybody else can overcome in such an\\nunequal contest? Characters there may be more than human, who are\\nexceptions—God may save a man, but not his own strength. Further, I\\nwould have you consider that the hireling Sophist only gives back to\\nthe world their own opinions; he is the keeper of the monster, who\\nknows how to flatter or anger him, and observes the meaning of his\\ninarticulate grunts. Good is what pleases him, evil what he dislikes;\\ntruth and beauty are determined only by the taste of the brute. Such is\\nthe Sophist’s wisdom, and such is the condition of those who make\\npublic opinion the test of truth, whether in art or in morals. The\\ncurse is laid upon them of being and doing what it approves, and when\\nthey attempt first principles the failure is ludicrous. Think of all\\nthis and ask yourself whether the world is more likely to be a believer\\nin the unity of the idea, or in the multiplicity of phenomena. And the\\nworld if not a believer in the idea cannot be a philosopher, and must\\ntherefore be a persecutor of philosophers. There is another evil:—the\\nworld does not like to lose the gifted nature, and so they flatter the\\nyoung (Alcibiades) into a magnificent opinion of his own capacity; the\\ntall, proper youth begins to expand, and is dreaming of kingdoms and\\nempires. If at this instant a friend whispers to him, ‘Now the gods\\nlighten thee; thou art a great fool’ and must be educated—do you think\\nthat he will listen? Or suppose a better sort of man who is attracted\\ntowards philosophy, will they not make Herculean efforts to spoil and\\ncorrupt him? Are we not right in saying that the love of knowledge, no\\nless than riches, may divert him? Men of this class (Critias) often\\nbecome politicians—they are the authors of great mischief in states,\\nand sometimes also of great good. And thus philosophy is deserted by\\nher natural protectors, and others enter in and dishonour her. Vulgar\\nlittle minds see the land open and rush from the prisons of the arts\\ninto her temple. A clever mechanic having a soul coarse as his body,\\nthinks that he will gain caste by becoming her suitor. For philosophy,\\neven in her fallen estate, has a dignity of her own—and he, like a bald\\nlittle blacksmith’s apprentice as he is, having made some money and got\\nout of durance, washes and dresses himself as a bridegroom and marries\\nhis master’s daughter. What will be the issue of such marriages? Will\\nthey not be vile and bastard, devoid of truth and nature? ‘They will.’\\nSmall, then, is the remnant of genuine philosophers; there may be a few\\nwho are citizens of small states, in which politics are not worth\\nthinking of, or who have been detained by Theages’ bridle of ill\\nhealth; for my own case of the oracular sign is almost unique, and too\\nrare to be worth mentioning. And these few when they have tasted the\\npleasures of philosophy, and have taken a look at that den of thieves\\nand place of wild beasts, which is human life, will stand aside from\\nthe storm under the shelter of a wall, and try to preserve their own\\ninnocence and to depart in peace. ‘A great work, too, will have been\\naccomplished by them.’ Great, yes, but not the greatest; for man is a\\nsocial being, and can only attain his highest development in the\\nsociety which is best suited to him.\\n\\nEnough, then, of the causes why philosophy has such an evil name.\\nAnother question is, Which of existing states is suited to her? Not one\\nof them; at present she is like some exotic seed which degenerates in a\\nstrange soil; only in her proper state will she be shown to be of\\nheavenly growth. ‘And is her proper state ours or some other?’ Ours in\\nall points but one, which was left undetermined. You may remember our\\nsaying that some living mind or witness of the legislator was needed in\\nstates. But we were afraid to enter upon a subject of such difficulty,\\nand now the question recurs and has not grown easier:—How may\\nphilosophy be safely studied? Let us bring her into the light of day,\\nand make an end of the inquiry.\\n\\nIn the first place, I say boldly that nothing can be worse than the\\npresent mode of study. Persons usually pick up a little philosophy in\\nearly youth, and in the intervals of business, but they never master\\nthe real difficulty, which is dialectic. Later, perhaps, they\\noccasionally go to a lecture on philosophy. Years advance, and the sun\\nof philosophy, unlike that of Heracleitus, sets never to rise again.\\nThis order of education should be reversed; it should begin with\\ngymnastics in youth, and as the man strengthens, he should increase the\\ngymnastics of his soul. Then, when active life is over, let him finally\\nreturn to philosophy. ‘You are in earnest, Socrates, but the world will\\nbe equally earnest in withstanding you—no more than Thrasymachus.’ Do\\nnot make a quarrel between Thrasymachus and me, who were never enemies\\nand are now good friends enough. And I shall do my best to convince him\\nand all mankind of the truth of my words, or at any rate to prepare for\\nthe future when, in another life, we may again take part in similar\\ndiscussions. ‘That will be a long time hence.’ Not long in comparison\\nwith eternity. The many will probably remain incredulous, for they have\\nnever seen the natural unity of ideas, but only artificial\\njuxtapositions; not free and generous thoughts, but tricks of\\ncontroversy and quips of law;—a perfect man ruling in a perfect state,\\neven a single one they have not known. And we foresaw that there was no\\nchance of perfection either in states or individuals until a necessity\\nwas laid upon philosophers—not the rogues, but those whom we called the\\nuseless class—of holding office; or until the sons of kings were\\ninspired with a true love of philosophy. Whether in the infinity of\\npast time there has been, or is in some distant land, or ever will be\\nhereafter, an ideal such as we have described, we stoutly maintain that\\nthere has been, is, and will be such a state whenever the Muse of\\nphilosophy rules. Will you say that the world is of another mind? O, my\\nfriend, do not revile the world! They will soon change their opinion if\\nthey are gently entreated, and are taught the true nature of the\\nphilosopher. Who can hate a man who loves him? Or be jealous of one who\\nhas no jealousy? Consider, again, that the many hate not the true but\\nthe false philosophers—the pretenders who force their way in without\\ninvitation, and are always speaking of persons and not of principles,\\nwhich is unlike the spirit of philosophy. For the true philosopher\\ndespises earthly strife; his eye is fixed on the eternal order in\\naccordance with which he moulds himself into the Divine image (and not\\nhimself only, but other men), and is the creator of the virtues private\\nas well as public. When mankind see that the happiness of states is\\nonly to be found in that image, will they be angry with us for\\nattempting to delineate it? ‘Certainly not. But what will be the\\nprocess of delineation?’ The artist will do nothing until he has made a\\ntabula rasa; on this he will inscribe the constitution of a state,\\nglancing often at the divine truth of nature, and from that deriving\\nthe godlike among men, mingling the two elements, rubbing out and\\npainting in, until there is a perfect harmony or fusion of the divine\\nand human. But perhaps the world will doubt the existence of such an\\nartist. What will they doubt? That the philosopher is a lover of truth,\\nhaving a nature akin to the best?—and if they admit this will they\\nstill quarrel with us for making philosophers our kings? ‘They will be\\nless disposed to quarrel.’ Let us assume then that they are pacified.\\nStill, a person may hesitate about the probability of the son of a king\\nbeing a philosopher. And we do not deny that they are very liable to be\\ncorrupted; but yet surely in the course of ages there might be one\\nexception—and one is enough. If one son of a king were a philosopher,\\nand had obedient citizens, he might bring the ideal polity into being.\\nHence we conclude that our laws are not only the best, but that they\\nare also possible, though not free from difficulty.\\n\\nI gained nothing by evading the troublesome questions which arose\\nconcerning women and children. I will be wiser now and acknowledge that\\nwe must go to the bottom of another question: What is to be the\\neducation of our guardians? It was agreed that they were to be lovers\\nof their country, and were to be tested in the refiner’s fire of\\npleasures and pains, and those who came forth pure and remained fixed\\nin their principles were to have honours and rewards in life and after\\ndeath. But at this point, the argument put on her veil and turned into\\nanother path. I hesitated to make the assertion which I now\\nhazard,—that our guardians must be philosophers. You remember all the\\ncontradictory elements, which met in the philosopher—how difficult to\\nfind them all in a single person! Intelligence and spirit are not often\\ncombined with steadiness; the stolid, fearless, nature is averse to\\nintellectual toil. And yet these opposite elements are all necessary,\\nand therefore, as we were saying before, the aspirant must be tested in\\npleasures and dangers; and also, as we must now further add, in the\\nhighest branches of knowledge. You will remember, that when we spoke of\\nthe virtues mention was made of a longer road, which you were satisfied\\nto leave unexplored. ‘Enough seemed to have been said.’ Enough, my\\nfriend; but what is enough while anything remains wanting? Of all men\\nthe guardian must not faint in the search after truth; he must be\\nprepared to take the longer road, or he will never reach that higher\\nregion which is above the four virtues; and of the virtues too he must\\nnot only get an outline, but a clear and distinct vision. (Strange that\\nwe should be so precise about trifles, so careless about the highest\\ntruths!) ‘And what are the highest?’ You to pretend unconsciousness,\\nwhen you have so often heard me speak of the idea of good, about which\\nwe know so little, and without which though a man gain the world he has\\nno profit of it! Some people imagine that the good is wisdom; but this\\ninvolves a circle,—the good, they say, is wisdom, wisdom has to do with\\nthe good. According to others the good is pleasure; but then comes the\\nabsurdity that good is bad, for there are bad pleasures as well as\\ngood. Again, the good must have reality; a man may desire the\\nappearance of virtue, but he will not desire the appearance of good.\\nOught our guardians then to be ignorant of this supreme principle, of\\nwhich every man has a presentiment, and without which no man has any\\nreal knowledge of anything? ‘But, Socrates, what is this supreme\\nprinciple, knowledge or pleasure, or what? You may think me\\ntroublesome, but I say that you have no business to be always repeating\\nthe doctrines of others instead of giving us your own.’ Can I say what\\nI do not know? ‘You may offer an opinion.’ And will the blindness and\\ncrookedness of opinion content you when you might have the light and\\ncertainty of science? ‘I will only ask you to give such an explanation\\nof the good as you have given already of temperance and justice.’ I\\nwish that I could, but in my present mood I cannot reach to the height\\nof the knowledge of the good. To the parent or principal I cannot\\nintroduce you, but to the child begotten in his image, which I may\\ncompare with the interest on the principal, I will. (Audit the account,\\nand do not let me give you a false statement of the debt.) You remember\\nour old distinction of the many beautiful and the one beautiful, the\\nparticular and the universal, the objects of sight and the objects of\\nthought? Did you ever consider that the objects of sight imply a\\nfaculty of sight which is the most complex and costly of our senses,\\nrequiring not only objects of sense, but also a medium, which is light;\\nwithout which the sight will not distinguish between colours and all\\nwill be a blank? For light is the noble bond between the perceiving\\nfaculty and the thing perceived, and the god who gives us light is the\\nsun, who is the eye of the day, but is not to be confounded with the\\neye of man. This eye of the day or sun is what I call the child of the\\ngood, standing in the same relation to the visible world as the good to\\nthe intellectual. When the sun shines the eye sees, and in the\\nintellectual world where truth is, there is sight and light. Now that\\nwhich is the sun of intelligent natures, is the idea of good, the cause\\nof knowledge and truth, yet other and fairer than they are, and\\nstanding in the same relation to them in which the sun stands to light.\\nO inconceivable height of beauty, which is above knowledge and above\\ntruth! (‘You cannot surely mean pleasure,’ he said. Peace, I replied.)\\nAnd this idea of good, like the sun, is also the cause of growth, and\\nthe author not of knowledge only, but of being, yet greater far than\\neither in dignity and power. ‘That is a reach of thought more than\\nhuman; but, pray, go on with the image, for I suspect that there is\\nmore behind.’ There is, I said; and bearing in mind our two suns or\\nprinciples, imagine further their corresponding worlds—one of the\\nvisible, the other of the intelligible; you may assist your fancy by\\nfiguring the distinction under the image of a line divided into two\\nunequal parts, and may again subdivide each part into two lesser\\nsegments representative of the stages of knowledge in either sphere.\\nThe lower portion of the lower or visible sphere will consist of\\nshadows and reflections, and its upper and smaller portion will contain\\nreal objects in the world of nature or of art. The sphere of the\\nintelligible will also have two divisions,—one of mathematics, in which\\nthere is no ascent but all is descent; no inquiring into premises, but\\nonly drawing of inferences. In this division the mind works with\\nfigures and numbers, the images of which are taken not from the\\nshadows, but from the objects, although the truth of them is seen only\\nwith the mind’s eye; and they are used as hypotheses without being\\nanalysed. Whereas in the other division reason uses the hypotheses as\\nstages or steps in the ascent to the idea of good, to which she fastens\\nthem, and then again descends, walking firmly in the region of ideas,\\nand of ideas only, in her ascent as well as descent, and finally\\nresting in them. ‘I partly understand,’ he replied; ‘you mean that the\\nideas of science are superior to the hypothetical, metaphorical\\nconceptions of geometry and the other arts or sciences, whichever is to\\nbe the name of them; and the latter conceptions you refuse to make\\nsubjects of pure intellect, because they have no first principle,\\nalthough when resting on a first principle, they pass into the higher\\nsphere.’ You understand me very well, I said. And now to those four\\ndivisions of knowledge you may assign four corresponding faculties—pure\\nintelligence to the highest sphere; active intelligence to the second;\\nto the third, faith; to the fourth, the perception of shadows—and the\\nclearness of the several faculties will be in the same ratio as the\\ntruth of the objects to which they are related...\\n\\nLike Socrates, we may recapitulate the virtues of the philosopher. In\\nlanguage which seems to reach beyond the horizon of that age and\\ncountry, he is described as ‘the spectator of all time and all\\nexistence.’ He has the noblest gifts of nature, and makes the highest\\nuse of them. All his desires are absorbed in the love of wisdom, which\\nis the love of truth. None of the graces of a beautiful soul are\\nwanting in him; neither can he fear death, or think much of human life.\\nThe ideal of modern times hardly retains the simplicity of the antique;\\nthere is not the same originality either in truth or error which\\ncharacterized the Greeks. The philosopher is no longer living in the\\nunseen, nor is he sent by an oracle to convince mankind of ignorance;\\nnor does he regard knowledge as a system of ideas leading upwards by\\nregular stages to the idea of good. The eagerness of the pursuit has\\nabated; there is more division of labour and less of comprehensive\\nreflection upon nature and human life as a whole; more of exact\\nobservation and less of anticipation and inspiration. Still, in the\\naltered conditions of knowledge, the parallel is not wholly lost; and\\nthere may be a use in translating the conception of Plato into the\\nlanguage of our own age. The philosopher in modern times is one who\\nfixes his mind on the laws of nature in their sequence and connexion,\\nnot on fragments or pictures of nature; on history, not on controversy;\\non the truths which are acknowledged by the few, not on the opinions of\\nthe many. He is aware of the importance of ‘classifying according to\\nnature,’ and will try to ‘separate the limbs of science without\\nbreaking them’ (Phaedr.). There is no part of truth, whether great or\\nsmall, which he will dishonour; and in the least things he will discern\\nthe greatest (Parmen.). Like the ancient philosopher he sees the world\\npervaded by analogies, but he can also tell ‘why in some cases a single\\ninstance is sufficient for an induction’ (Mill’s Logic), while in other\\ncases a thousand examples would prove nothing. He inquires into a\\nportion of knowledge only, because the whole has grown too vast to be\\nembraced by a single mind or life. He has a clearer conception of the\\ndivisions of science and of their relation to the mind of man than was\\npossible to the ancients. Like Plato, he has a vision of the unity of\\nknowledge, not as the beginning of philosophy to be attained by a study\\nof elementary mathematics, but as the far-off result of the working of\\nmany minds in many ages. He is aware that mathematical studies are\\npreliminary to almost every other; at the same time, he will not reduce\\nall varieties of knowledge to the type of mathematics. He too must have\\na nobility of character, without which genius loses the better half of\\ngreatness. Regarding the world as a point in immensity, and each\\nindividual as a link in a never-ending chain of existence, he will not\\nthink much of his own life, or be greatly afraid of death.\\n\\nAdeimantus objects first of all to the form of the Socratic reasoning,\\nthus showing that Plato is aware of the imperfection of his own method.\\nHe brings the accusation against himself which might be brought against\\nhim by a modern logician—that he extracts the answer because he knows\\nhow to put the question. In a long argument words are apt to change\\ntheir meaning slightly, or premises may be assumed or conclusions\\ninferred with rather too much certainty or universality; the variation\\nat each step may be unobserved, and yet at last the divergence becomes\\nconsiderable. Hence the failure of attempts to apply arithmetical or\\nalgebraic formulae to logic. The imperfection, or rather the higher and\\nmore elastic nature of language, does not allow words to have the\\nprecision of numbers or of symbols. And this quality in language\\nimpairs the force of an argument which has many steps.\\n\\nThe objection, though fairly met by Socrates in this particular\\ninstance, may be regarded as implying a reflection upon the Socratic\\nmode of reasoning. And here, as elsewhere, Plato seems to intimate that\\nthe time had come when the negative and interrogative method of\\nSocrates must be superseded by a positive and constructive one, of\\nwhich examples are given in some of the later dialogues. Adeimantus\\nfurther argues that the ideal is wholly at variance with facts; for\\nexperience proves philosophers to be either useless or rogues. Contrary\\nto all expectation Socrates has no hesitation in admitting the truth of\\nthis, and explains the anomaly in an allegory, first characteristically\\ndepreciating his own inventive powers. In this allegory the people are\\ndistinguished from the professional politicians, and, as elsewhere, are\\nspoken of in a tone of pity rather than of censure under the image of\\n‘the noble captain who is not very quick in his perceptions.’\\n\\nThe uselessness of philosophers is explained by the circumstance that\\nmankind will not use them. The world in all ages has been divided\\nbetween contempt and fear of those who employ the power of ideas and\\nknow no other weapons. Concerning the false philosopher, Socrates\\nargues that the best is most liable to corruption; and that the finer\\nnature is more likely to suffer from alien conditions. We too observe\\nthat there are some kinds of excellence which spring from a peculiar\\ndelicacy of constitution; as is evidently true of the poetical and\\nimaginative temperament, which often seems to depend on impressions,\\nand hence can only breathe or live in a certain atmosphere. The man of\\ngenius has greater pains and greater pleasures, greater powers and\\ngreater weaknesses, and often a greater play of character than is to be\\nfound in ordinary men. He can assume the disguise of virtue or\\ndisinterestedness without having them, or veil personal enmity in the\\nlanguage of patriotism and philosophy,—he can say the word which all\\nmen are thinking, he has an insight which is terrible into the follies\\nand weaknesses of his fellow-men. An Alcibiades, a Mirabeau, or a\\nNapoleon the First, are born either to be the authors of great evils in\\nstates, or ‘of great good, when they are drawn in that direction.’\\n\\nYet the thesis, ‘corruptio optimi pessima,’ cannot be maintained\\ngenerally or without regard to the kind of excellence which is\\ncorrupted. The alien conditions which are corrupting to one nature, may\\nbe the elements of culture to another. In general a man can only\\nreceive his highest development in a congenial state or family, among\\nfriends or fellow-workers. But also he may sometimes be stirred by\\nadverse circumstances to such a degree that he rises up against them\\nand reforms them. And while weaker or coarser characters will extract\\ngood out of evil, say in a corrupt state of the church or of society,\\nand live on happily, allowing the evil to remain, the finer or stronger\\nnatures may be crushed or spoiled by surrounding influences—may become\\nmisanthrope and philanthrope by turns; or in a few instances, like the\\nfounders of the monastic orders, or the Reformers, owing to some\\npeculiarity in themselves or in their age, may break away entirely from\\nthe world and from the church, sometimes into great good, sometimes\\ninto great evil, sometimes into both. And the same holds in the lesser\\nsphere of a convent, a school, a family.\\n\\nPlato would have us consider how easily the best natures are\\noverpowered by public opinion, and what efforts the rest of mankind\\nwill make to get possession of them. The world, the church, their own\\nprofession, any political or party organization, are always carrying\\nthem off their legs and teaching them to apply high and holy names to\\ntheir own prejudices and interests. The ‘monster’ corporation to which\\nthey belong judges right and truth to be the pleasure of the community.\\nThe individual becomes one with his order; or, if he resists, the world\\nis too much for him, and will sooner or later be revenged on him. This\\nis, perhaps, a one-sided but not wholly untrue picture of the maxims\\nand practice of mankind when they ‘sit down together at an assembly,’\\neither in ancient or modern times.\\n\\nWhen the higher natures are corrupted by politics, the lower take\\npossession of the vacant place of philosophy. This is described in one\\nof those continuous images in which the argument, to use a Platonic\\nexpression, ‘veils herself,’ and which is dropped and reappears at\\nintervals. The question is asked,—Why are the citizens of states so\\nhostile to philosophy? The answer is, that they do not know her. And\\nyet there is also a better mind of the many; they would believe if they\\nwere taught. But hitherto they have only known a conventional imitation\\nof philosophy, words without thoughts, systems which have no life in\\nthem; a (divine) person uttering the words of beauty and freedom, the\\nfriend of man holding communion with the Eternal, and seeking to frame\\nthe state in that image, they have never known. The same double feeling\\nrespecting the mass of mankind has always existed among men. The first\\nthought is that the people are the enemies of truth and right; the\\nsecond, that this only arises out of an accidental error and confusion,\\nand that they do not really hate those who love them, if they could be\\neducated to know them.\\n\\nIn the latter part of the sixth book, three questions have to be\\nconsidered: 1st, the nature of the longer and more circuitous way,\\nwhich is contrasted with the shorter and more imperfect method of Book\\nIV; 2nd, the heavenly pattern or idea of the state; 3rd, the relation\\nof the divisions of knowledge to one another and to the corresponding\\nfaculties of the soul:\\n\\n1. Of the higher method of knowledge in Plato we have only a glimpse.\\nNeither here nor in the Phaedrus or Symposium, nor yet in the Philebus\\nor Sophist, does he give any clear explanation of his meaning. He would\\nprobably have described his method as proceeding by regular steps to a\\nsystem of universal knowledge, which inferred the parts from the whole\\nrather than the whole from the parts. This ideal logic is not practised\\nby him in the search after justice, or in the analysis of the parts of\\nthe soul; there, like Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics, he argues\\nfrom experience and the common use of language. But at the end of the\\nsixth book he conceives another and more perfect method, in which all\\nideas are only steps or grades or moments of thought, forming a\\nconnected whole which is self-supporting, and in which consistency is\\nthe test of truth. He does not explain to us in detail the nature of\\nthe process. Like many other thinkers both in ancient and modern times\\nhis mind seems to be filled with a vacant form which he is unable to\\nrealize. He supposes the sciences to have a natural order and connexion\\nin an age when they can hardly be said to exist. He is hastening on to\\nthe ‘end of the intellectual world’ without even making a beginning of\\nthem.\\n\\nIn modern times we hardly need to be reminded that the process of\\nacquiring knowledge is here confused with the contemplation of absolute\\nknowledge. In all science a priori and a posteriori truths mingle in\\nvarious proportions. The a priori part is that which is derived from\\nthe most universal experience of men, or is universally accepted by\\nthem; the a posteriori is that which grows up around the more general\\nprinciples and becomes imperceptibly one with them. But Plato\\nerroneously imagines that the synthesis is separable from the analysis,\\nand that the method of science can anticipate science. In entertaining\\nsuch a vision of a priori knowledge he is sufficiently justified, or at\\nleast his meaning may be sufficiently explained by the similar attempts\\nof Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and even of Bacon himself, in modern\\nphilosophy. Anticipations or divinations, or prophetic glimpses of\\ntruths whether concerning man or nature, seem to stand in the same\\nrelation to ancient philosophy which hypotheses bear to modern\\ninductive science. These ‘guesses at truth’ were not made at random;\\nthey arose from a superficial impression of uniformities and first\\nprinciples in nature which the genius of the Greek, contemplating the\\nexpanse of heaven and earth, seemed to recognize in the distance. Nor\\ncan we deny that in ancient times knowledge must have stood still, and\\nthe human mind been deprived of the very instruments of thought, if\\nphilosophy had been strictly confined to the results of experience.\\n\\n2. Plato supposes that when the tablet has been made blank the artist\\nwill fill in the lineaments of the ideal state. Is this a pattern laid\\nup in heaven, or mere vacancy on which he is supposed to gaze with\\nwondering eye? The answer is, that such ideals are framed partly by the\\nomission of particulars, partly by imagination perfecting the form\\nwhich experience supplies (Phaedo). Plato represents these ideals in a\\nfigure as belonging to another world; and in modern times the idea will\\nsometimes seem to precede, at other times to co-operate with the hand\\nof the artist. As in science, so also in creative art, there is a\\nsynthetical as well as an analytical method. One man will have the\\nwhole in his mind before he begins; to another the processes of mind\\nand hand will be simultaneous.\\n\\n3. There is no difficulty in seeing that Plato’s divisions of knowledge\\nare based, first, on the fundamental antithesis of sensible and\\nintellectual which pervades the whole pre-Socratic philosophy; in which\\nis implied also the opposition of the permanent and transient, of the\\nuniversal and particular. But the age of philosophy in which he lived\\nseemed to require a further distinction;—numbers and figures were\\nbeginning to separate from ideas. The world could no longer regard\\njustice as a cube, and was learning to see, though imperfectly, that\\nthe abstractions of sense were distinct from the abstractions of mind.\\nBetween the Eleatic being or essence and the shadows of phenomena, the\\nPythagorean principle of number found a place, and was, as Aristotle\\nremarks, a conducting medium from one to the other. Hence Plato is led\\nto introduce a third term which had not hitherto entered into the\\nscheme of his philosophy. He had observed the use of mathematics in\\neducation; they were the best preparation for higher studies. The\\nsubjective relation between them further suggested an objective one;\\nalthough the passage from one to the other is really imaginary\\n(Metaph.). For metaphysical and moral philosophy has no connexion with\\nmathematics; number and figure are the abstractions of time and space,\\nnot the expressions of purely intellectual conceptions. When divested\\nof metaphor, a straight line or a square has no more to do with right\\nand justice than a crooked line with vice. The figurative association\\nwas mistaken for a real one; and thus the three latter divisions of the\\nPlatonic proportion were constructed.\\n\\nThere is more difficulty in comprehending how he arrived at the first\\nterm of the series, which is nowhere else mentioned, and has no\\nreference to any other part of his system. Nor indeed does the relation\\nof shadows to objects correspond to the relation of numbers to ideas.\\nProbably Plato has been led by the love of analogy (Timaeus) to make\\nfour terms instead of three, although the objects perceived in both\\ndivisions of the lower sphere are equally objects of sense. He is also\\npreparing the way, as his manner is, for the shadows of images at the\\nbeginning of the seventh book, and the imitation of an imitation in the\\ntenth. The line may be regarded as reaching from unity to infinity, and\\nis divided into two unequal parts, and subdivided into two more; each\\nlower sphere is the multiplication of the preceding. Of the four\\nfaculties, faith in the lower division has an intermediate position\\n(cp. for the use of the word faith or belief, (Greek), Timaeus),\\ncontrasting equally with the vagueness of the perception of shadows\\n(Greek) and the higher certainty of understanding (Greek) and reason\\n(Greek).\\n\\nThe difference between understanding and mind or reason (Greek) is\\nanalogous to the difference between acquiring knowledge in the parts\\nand the contemplation of the whole. True knowledge is a whole, and is\\nat rest; consistency and universality are the tests of truth. To this\\nself-evidencing knowledge of the whole the faculty of mind is supposed\\nto correspond. But there is a knowledge of the understanding which is\\nincomplete and in motion always, because unable to rest in the\\nsubordinate ideas. Those ideas are called both images and\\nhypotheses—images because they are clothed in sense, hypotheses because\\nthey are assumptions only, until they are brought into connexion with\\nthe idea of good.\\n\\nThe general meaning of the passage, ‘Noble, then, is the bond which\\nlinks together sight...And of this kind I spoke as the intelligible...’\\nso far as the thought contained in it admits of being translated into\\nthe terms of modern philosophy, may be described or explained as\\nfollows:—There is a truth, one and self-existent, to which by the help\\nof a ladder let down from above, the human intelligence may ascend.\\nThis unity is like the sun in the heavens, the light by which all\\nthings are seen, the being by which they are created and sustained. It\\nis the IDEA of good. And the steps of the ladder leading up to this\\nhighest or universal existence are the mathematical sciences, which\\nalso contain in themselves an element of the universal. These, too, we\\nsee in a new manner when we connect them with the idea of good. They\\nthen cease to be hypotheses or pictures, and become essential parts of\\na higher truth which is at once their first principle and their final\\ncause.\\n\\nWe cannot give any more precise meaning to this remarkable passage, but\\nwe may trace in it several rudiments or vestiges of thought which are\\ncommon to us and to Plato: such as (1) the unity and correlation of the\\nsciences, or rather of science, for in Plato’s time they were not yet\\nparted off or distinguished; (2) the existence of a Divine Power, or\\nlife or idea or cause or reason, not yet conceived or no longer\\nconceived as in the Timaeus and elsewhere under the form of a person;\\n(3) the recognition of the hypothetical and conditional character of\\nthe mathematical sciences, and in a measure of every science when\\nisolated from the rest; (4) the conviction of a truth which is\\ninvisible, and of a law, though hardly a law of nature, which permeates\\nthe intellectual rather than the visible world.\\n\\nThe method of Socrates is hesitating and tentative, awaiting the fuller\\nexplanation of the idea of good, and of the nature of dialectic in the\\nseventh book. The imperfect intelligence of Glaucon, and the reluctance\\nof Socrates to make a beginning, mark the difficulty of the subject.\\nThe allusion to Theages’ bridle, and to the internal oracle, or demonic\\nsign, of Socrates, which here, as always in Plato, is only prohibitory;\\nthe remark that the salvation of any remnant of good in the present\\nevil state of the world is due to God only; the reference to a future\\nstate of existence, which is unknown to Glaucon in the tenth book, and\\nin which the discussions of Socrates and his disciples would be\\nresumed; the surprise in the answers; the fanciful irony of Socrates,\\nwhere he pretends that he can only describe the strange position of the\\nphilosopher in a figure of speech; the original observation that the\\nSophists, after all, are only the representatives and not the leaders\\nof public opinion; the picture of the philosopher standing aside in the\\nshower of sleet under a wall; the figure of ‘the great beast’ followed\\nby the expression of good-will towards the common people who would not\\nhave rejected the philosopher if they had known him; the ‘right noble\\nthought’ that the highest truths demand the greatest exactness; the\\nhesitation of Socrates in returning once more to his well-worn theme of\\nthe idea of good; the ludicrous earnestness of Glaucon; the comparison\\nof philosophy to a deserted maiden who marries beneath her—are some of\\nthe most interesting characteristics of the sixth book.\\n\\nYet a few more words may be added, on the old theme, which was so oft\\ndiscussed in the Socratic circle, of which we, like Glaucon and\\nAdeimantus, would fain, if possible, have a clearer notion. Like them,\\nwe are dissatisfied when we are told that the idea of good can only be\\nrevealed to a student of the mathematical sciences, and we are inclined\\nto think that neither we nor they could have been led along that path\\nto any satisfactory goal. For we have learned that differences of\\nquantity cannot pass into differences of quality, and that the\\nmathematical sciences can never rise above themselves into the sphere\\nof our higher thoughts, although they may sometimes furnish symbols and\\nexpressions of them, and may train the mind in habits of abstraction\\nand self-concentration. The illusion which was natural to an ancient\\nphilosopher has ceased to be an illusion to us. But if the process by\\nwhich we are supposed to arrive at the idea of good be really\\nimaginary, may not the idea itself be also a mere abstraction? We\\nremark, first, that in all ages, and especially in primitive\\nphilosophy, words such as being, essence, unity, good, have exerted an\\nextraordinary influence over the minds of men. The meagreness or\\nnegativeness of their content has been in an inverse ratio to their\\npower. They have become the forms under which all things were\\ncomprehended. There was a need or instinct in the human soul which they\\nsatisfied; they were not ideas, but gods, and to this new mythology the\\nmen of a later generation began to attach the powers and associations\\nof the elder deities.\\n\\nThe idea of good is one of those sacred words or forms of thought,\\nwhich were beginning to take the place of the old mythology. It meant\\nunity, in which all time and all existence were gathered up. It was the\\ntruth of all things, and also the light in which they shone forth, and\\nbecame evident to intelligences human and divine. It was the cause of\\nall things, the power by which they were brought into being. It was the\\nuniversal reason divested of a human personality. It was the life as\\nwell as the light of the world, all knowledge and all power were\\ncomprehended in it. The way to it was through the mathematical\\nsciences, and these too were dependent on it. To ask whether God was\\nthe maker of it, or made by it, would be like asking whether God could\\nbe conceived apart from goodness, or goodness apart from God. The God\\nof the Timaeus is not really at variance with the idea of good; they\\nare aspects of the same, differing only as the personal from the\\nimpersonal, or the masculine from the neuter, the one being the\\nexpression or language of mythology, the other of philosophy.\\n\\nThis, or something like this, is the meaning of the idea of good as\\nconceived by Plato. Ideas of number, order, harmony, development may\\nalso be said to enter into it. The paraphrase which has just been given\\nof it goes beyond the actual words of Plato. We have perhaps arrived at\\nthe stage of philosophy which enables us to understand what he is\\naiming at, better than he did himself. We are beginning to realize what\\nhe saw darkly and at a distance. But if he could have been told that\\nthis, or some conception of the same kind, but higher than this, was\\nthe truth at which he was aiming, and the need which he sought to\\nsupply, he would gladly have recognized that more was contained in his\\nown thoughts than he himself knew. As his words are few and his manner\\nreticent and tentative, so must the style of his interpreter be. We\\nshould not approach his meaning more nearly by attempting to define it\\nfurther. In translating him into the language of modern thought, we\\nmight insensibly lose the spirit of ancient philosophy. It is\\nremarkable that although Plato speaks of the idea of good as the first\\nprinciple of truth and being, it is nowhere mentioned in his writings\\nexcept in this passage. Nor did it retain any hold upon the minds of\\nhis disciples in a later generation; it was probably unintelligible to\\nthem. Nor does the mention of it in Aristotle appear to have any\\nreference to this or any other passage in his extant writings.\\n\\nBOOK VII. And now I will describe in a figure the enlightenment or\\nunenlightenment of our nature:—Imagine human beings living in an\\nunderground den which is open towards the light; they have been there\\nfrom childhood, having their necks and legs chained, and can only see\\ninto the den. At a distance there is a fire, and between the fire and\\nthe prisoners a raised way, and a low wall is built along the way, like\\nthe screen over which marionette players show their puppets. Behind the\\nwall appear moving figures, who hold in their hands various works of\\nart, and among them images of men and animals, wood and stone, and some\\nof the passers-by are talking and others silent. ‘A strange parable,’\\nhe said, ‘and strange captives.’ They are ourselves, I replied; and\\nthey see only the shadows of the images which the fire throws on the\\nwall of the den; to these they give names, and if we add an echo which\\nreturns from the wall, the voices of the passengers will seem to\\nproceed from the shadows. Suppose now that you suddenly turn them round\\nand make them look with pain and grief to themselves at the real\\nimages; will they believe them to be real? Will not their eyes be\\ndazzled, and will they not try to get away from the light to something\\nwhich they are able to behold without blinking? And suppose further,\\nthat they are dragged up a steep and rugged ascent into the presence of\\nthe sun himself, will not their sight be darkened with the excess of\\nlight? Some time will pass before they get the habit of perceiving at\\nall; and at first they will be able to perceive only shadows and\\nreflections in the water; then they will recognize the moon and the\\nstars, and will at length behold the sun in his own proper place as he\\nis. Last of all they will conclude:—This is he who gives us the year\\nand the seasons, and is the author of all that we see. How will they\\nrejoice in passing from darkness to light! How worthless to them will\\nseem the honours and glories of the den! But now imagine further, that\\nthey descend into their old habitations;—in that underground dwelling\\nthey will not see as well as their fellows, and will not be able to\\ncompete with them in the measurement of the shadows on the wall; there\\nwill be many jokes about the man who went on a visit to the sun and\\nlost his eyes, and if they find anybody trying to set free and\\nenlighten one of their number, they will put him to death, if they can\\ncatch him. Now the cave or den is the world of sight, the fire is the\\nsun, the way upwards is the way to knowledge, and in the world of\\nknowledge the idea of good is last seen and with difficulty, but when\\nseen is inferred to be the author of good and right—parent of the lord\\nof light in this world, and of truth and understanding in the other. He\\nwho attains to the beatific vision is always going upwards; he is\\nunwilling to descend into political assemblies and courts of law; for\\nhis eyes are apt to blink at the images or shadows of images which they\\nbehold in them—he cannot enter into the ideas of those who have never\\nin their lives understood the relation of the shadow to the substance.\\nBut blindness is of two kinds, and may be caused either by passing out\\nof darkness into light or out of light into darkness, and a man of\\nsense will distinguish between them, and will not laugh equally at both\\nof them, but the blindness which arises from fulness of light he will\\ndeem blessed, and pity the other; or if he laugh at the puzzled soul\\nlooking at the sun, he will have more reason to laugh than the\\ninhabitants of the den at those who descend from above. There is a\\nfurther lesson taught by this parable of ours. Some persons fancy that\\ninstruction is like giving eyes to the blind, but we say that the\\nfaculty of sight was always there, and that the soul only requires to\\nbe turned round towards the light. And this is conversion; other\\nvirtues are almost like bodily habits, and may be acquired in the same\\nmanner, but intelligence has a diviner life, and is indestructible,\\nturning either to good or evil according to the direction given. Did\\nyou never observe how the mind of a clever rogue peers out of his eyes,\\nand the more clearly he sees, the more evil he does? Now if you take\\nsuch an one, and cut away from him those leaden weights of pleasure and\\ndesire which bind his soul to earth, his intelligence will be turned\\nround, and he will behold the truth as clearly as he now discerns his\\nmeaner ends. And have we not decided that our rulers must neither be so\\nuneducated as to have no fixed rule of life, nor so over-educated as to\\nbe unwilling to leave their paradise for the business of the world? We\\nmust choose out therefore the natures who are most likely to ascend to\\nthe light and knowledge of the good; but we must not allow them to\\nremain in the region of light; they must be forced down again among the\\ncaptives in the den to partake of their labours and honours. ‘Will they\\nnot think this a hardship?’ You should remember that our purpose in\\nframing the State was not that our citizens should do what they like,\\nbut that they should serve the State for the common good of all. May we\\nnot fairly say to our philosopher,—Friend, we do you no wrong; for in\\nother States philosophy grows wild, and a wild plant owes nothing to\\nthe gardener, but you have been trained by us to be the rulers and\\nkings of our hive, and therefore we must insist on your descending into\\nthe den. You must, each of you, take your turn, and become able to use\\nyour eyes in the dark, and with a little practice you will see far\\nbetter than those who quarrel about the shadows, whose knowledge is a\\ndream only, whilst yours is a waking reality. It may be that the saint\\nor philosopher who is best fitted, may also be the least inclined to\\nrule, but necessity is laid upon him, and he must no longer live in the\\nheaven of ideas. And this will be the salvation of the State. For those\\nwho rule must not be those who are desirous to rule; and, if you can\\noffer to our citizens a better life than that of rulers generally is,\\nthere will be a chance that the rich, not only in this world’s goods,\\nbut in virtue and wisdom, may bear rule. And the only life which is\\nbetter than the life of political ambition is that of philosophy, which\\nis also the best preparation for the government of a State.\\n\\nThen now comes the question,—How shall we create our rulers; what way\\nis there from darkness to light? The change is effected by philosophy;\\nit is not the turning over of an oyster-shell, but the conversion of a\\nsoul from night to day, from becoming to being. And what training will\\ndraw the soul upwards? Our former education had two branches,\\ngymnastic, which was occupied with the body, and music, the sister art,\\nwhich infused a natural harmony into mind and literature; but neither\\nof these sciences gave any promise of doing what we want. Nothing\\nremains to us but that universal or primary science of which all the\\narts and sciences are partakers, I mean number or calculation. ‘Very\\ntrue.’ Including the art of war? ‘Yes, certainly.’ Then there is\\nsomething ludicrous about Palamedes in the tragedy, coming in and\\nsaying that he had invented number, and had counted the ranks and set\\nthem in order. For if Agamemnon could not count his feet (and without\\nnumber how could he?) he must have been a pretty sort of general\\nindeed. No man should be a soldier who cannot count, and indeed he is\\nhardly to be called a man. But I am not speaking of these practical\\napplications of arithmetic, for number, in my view, is rather to be\\nregarded as a conductor to thought and being. I will explain what I\\nmean by the last expression:—Things sensible are of two kinds; the one\\nclass invite or stimulate the mind, while in the other the mind\\nacquiesces. Now the stimulating class are the things which suggest\\ncontrast and relation. For example, suppose that I hold up to the eyes\\nthree fingers—a fore finger, a middle finger, a little finger—the sight\\nequally recognizes all three fingers, but without number cannot further\\ndistinguish them. Or again, suppose two objects to be relatively great\\nand small, these ideas of greatness and smallness are supplied not by\\nthe sense, but by the mind. And the perception of their contrast or\\nrelation quickens and sets in motion the mind, which is puzzled by the\\nconfused intimations of sense, and has recourse to number in order to\\nfind out whether the things indicated are one or more than one. Number\\nreplies that they are two and not one, and are to be distinguished from\\none another. Again, the sight beholds great and small, but only in a\\nconfused chaos, and not until they are distinguished does the question\\narise of their respective natures; we are thus led on to the\\ndistinction between the visible and intelligible. That was what I meant\\nwhen I spoke of stimulants to the intellect; I was thinking of the\\ncontradictions which arise in perception. The idea of unity, for\\nexample, like that of a finger, does not arouse thought unless\\ninvolving some conception of plurality; but when the one is also the\\nopposite of one, the contradiction gives rise to reflection; an example\\nof this is afforded by any object of sight. All number has also an\\nelevating effect; it raises the mind out of the foam and flux of\\ngeneration to the contemplation of being, having lesser military and\\nretail uses also. The retail use is not required by us; but as our\\nguardian is to be a soldier as well as a philosopher, the military one\\nmay be retained. And to our higher purpose no science can be better\\nadapted; but it must be pursued in the spirit of a philosopher, not of\\na shopkeeper. It is concerned, not with visible objects, but with\\nabstract truth; for numbers are pure abstractions—the true\\narithmetician indignantly denies that his unit is capable of division.\\nWhen you divide, he insists that you are only multiplying; his ‘one’ is\\nnot material or resolvable into fractions, but an unvarying and\\nabsolute equality; and this proves the purely intellectual character of\\nhis study. Note also the great power which arithmetic has of sharpening\\nthe wits; no other discipline is equally severe, or an equal test of\\ngeneral ability, or equally improving to a stupid person.\\n\\nLet our second branch of education be geometry. ‘I can easily see,’\\nreplied Glaucon, ‘that the skill of the general will be doubled by his\\nknowledge of geometry.’ That is a small matter; the use of geometry, to\\nwhich I refer, is the assistance given by it in the contemplation of\\nthe idea of good, and the compelling the mind to look at true being,\\nand not at generation only. Yet the present mode of pursuing these\\nstudies, as any one who is the least of a mathematician is aware, is\\nmean and ridiculous; they are made to look downwards to the arts, and\\nnot upwards to eternal existence. The geometer is always talking of\\nsquaring, subtending, apposing, as if he had in view action; whereas\\nknowledge is the real object of the study. It should elevate the soul,\\nand create the mind of philosophy; it should raise up what has fallen\\ndown, not to speak of lesser uses in war and military tactics, and in\\nthe improvement of the faculties.\\n\\nShall we propose, as a third branch of our education, astronomy? ‘Very\\ngood,’ replied Glaucon; ‘the knowledge of the heavens is necessary at\\nonce for husbandry, navigation, military tactics.’ I like your way of\\ngiving useful reasons for everything in order to make friends of the\\nworld. And there is a difficulty in proving to mankind that education\\nis not only useful information but a purification of the eye of the\\nsoul, which is better than the bodily eye, for by this alone is truth\\nseen. Now, will you appeal to mankind in general or to the philosopher?\\nor would you prefer to look to yourself only? ‘Every man is his own\\nbest friend.’ Then take a step backward, for we are out of order, and\\ninsert the third dimension which is of solids, after the second which\\nis of planes, and then you may proceed to solids in motion. But solid\\ngeometry is not popular and has not the patronage of the State, nor is\\nthe use of it fully recognized; the difficulty is great, and the\\nvotaries of the study are conceited and impatient. Still the charm of\\nthe pursuit wins upon men, and, if government would lend a little\\nassistance, there might be great progress made. ‘Very true,’ replied\\nGlaucon; ‘but do I understand you now to begin with plane geometry, and\\nto place next geometry of solids, and thirdly, astronomy, or the motion\\nof solids?’ Yes, I said; my hastiness has only hindered us.\\n\\n‘Very good, and now let us proceed to astronomy, about which I am\\nwilling to speak in your lofty strain. No one can fail to see that the\\ncontemplation of the heavens draws the soul upwards.’ I am an\\nexception, then; astronomy as studied at present appears to me to draw\\nthe soul not upwards, but downwards. Star-gazing is just looking up at\\nthe ceiling—no better; a man may lie on his back on land or on water—he\\nmay look up or look down, but there is no science in that. The vision\\nof knowledge of which I speak is seen not with the eyes, but with the\\nmind. All the magnificence of the heavens is but the embroidery of a\\ncopy which falls far short of the divine Original, and teaches nothing\\nabout the absolute harmonies or motions of things. Their beauty is like\\nthe beauty of figures drawn by the hand of Daedalus or any other great\\nartist, which may be used for illustration, but no mathematician would\\nseek to obtain from them true conceptions of equality or numerical\\nrelations. How ridiculous then to look for these in the map of the\\nheavens, in which the imperfection of matter comes in everywhere as a\\ndisturbing element, marring the symmetry of day and night, of months\\nand years, of the sun and stars in their courses. Only by problems can\\nwe place astronomy on a truly scientific basis. Let the heavens alone,\\nand exert the intellect.\\n\\nStill, mathematics admit of other applications, as the Pythagoreans\\nsay, and we agree. There is a sister science of harmonical motion,\\nadapted to the ear as astronomy is to the eye, and there may be other\\napplications also. Let us inquire of the Pythagoreans about them, not\\nforgetting that we have an aim higher than theirs, which is the\\nrelation of these sciences to the idea of good. The error which\\npervades astronomy also pervades harmonics. The musicians put their\\nears in the place of their minds. ‘Yes,’ replied Glaucon, ‘I like to\\nsee them laying their ears alongside of their neighbours’ faces—some\\nsaying, “That’s a new note,” others declaring that the two notes are\\nthe same.’ Yes, I said; but you mean the empirics who are always\\ntwisting and torturing the strings of the lyre, and quarrelling about\\nthe tempers of the strings; I am referring rather to the Pythagorean\\nharmonists, who are almost equally in error. For they investigate only\\nthe numbers of the consonances which are heard, and ascend no\\nhigher,—of the true numerical harmony which is unheard, and is only to\\nbe found in problems, they have not even a conception. ‘That last,’ he\\nsaid, ‘must be a marvellous thing.’ A thing, I replied, which is only\\nuseful if pursued with a view to the good.\\n\\nAll these sciences are the prelude of the strain, and are profitable if\\nthey are regarded in their natural relations to one another. ‘I dare\\nsay, Socrates,’ said Glaucon; ‘but such a study will be an endless\\nbusiness.’ What study do you mean—of the prelude, or what? For all\\nthese things are only the prelude, and you surely do not suppose that a\\nmere mathematician is also a dialectician? ‘Certainly not. I have\\nhardly ever known a mathematician who could reason.’ And yet, Glaucon,\\nis not true reasoning that hymn of dialectic which is the music of the\\nintellectual world, and which was by us compared to the effort of\\nsight, when from beholding the shadows on the wall we arrived at last\\nat the images which gave the shadows? Even so the dialectical faculty\\nwithdrawing from sense arrives by the pure intellect at the\\ncontemplation of the idea of good, and never rests but at the very end\\nof the intellectual world. And the royal road out of the cave into the\\nlight, and the blinking of the eyes at the sun and turning to\\ncontemplate the shadows of reality, not the shadows of an image\\nonly—this progress and gradual acquisition of a new faculty of sight by\\nthe help of the mathematical sciences, is the elevation of the soul to\\nthe contemplation of the highest ideal of being.\\n\\n‘So far, I agree with you. But now, leaving the prelude, let us proceed\\nto the hymn. What, then, is the nature of dialectic, and what are the\\npaths which lead thither?’ Dear Glaucon, you cannot follow me here.\\nThere can be no revelation of the absolute truth to one who has not\\nbeen disciplined in the previous sciences. But that there is a science\\nof absolute truth, which is attained in some way very different from\\nthose now practised, I am confident. For all other arts or sciences are\\nrelative to human needs and opinions; and the mathematical sciences are\\nbut a dream or hypothesis of true being, and never analyse their own\\nprinciples. Dialectic alone rises to the principle which is above\\nhypotheses, converting and gently leading the eye of the soul out of\\nthe barbarous slough of ignorance into the light of the upper world,\\nwith the help of the sciences which we have been describing—sciences,\\nas they are often termed, although they require some other name,\\nimplying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than\\nscience, and this in our previous sketch was understanding. And so we\\nget four names—two for intellect, and two for opinion,—reason or mind,\\nunderstanding, faith, perception of shadows—which make a proportion—\\nbeing:becoming::intellect:opinion—and science:belief::understanding:\\nperception of shadows. Dialectic may be further described as that\\nscience which defines and explains the essence or being of each nature,\\nwhich distinguishes and abstracts the good, and is ready to do battle\\nagainst all opponents in the cause of good. To him who is not a\\ndialectician life is but a sleepy dream; and many a man is in his grave\\nbefore his is well waked up. And would you have the future rulers of\\nyour ideal State intelligent beings, or stupid as posts? ‘Certainly not\\nthe latter.’ Then you must train them in dialectic, which will teach\\nthem to ask and answer questions, and is the coping-stone of the\\nsciences.\\n\\nI dare say that you have not forgotten how our rulers were chosen; and\\nthe process of selection may be carried a step further:—As before, they\\nmust be constant and valiant, good-looking, and of noble manners, but\\nnow they must also have natural ability which education will improve;\\nthat is to say, they must be quick at learning, capable of mental toil,\\nretentive, solid, diligent natures, who combine intellectual with moral\\nvirtues; not lame and one-sided, diligent in bodily exercise and\\nindolent in mind, or conversely; not a maimed soul, which hates\\nfalsehood and yet unintentionally is always wallowing in the mire of\\nignorance; not a bastard or feeble person, but sound in wind and limb,\\nand in perfect condition for the great gymnastic trial of the mind.\\nJustice herself can find no fault with natures such as these; and they\\nwill be the saviours of our State; disciples of another sort would only\\nmake philosophy more ridiculous than she is at present. Forgive my\\nenthusiasm; I am becoming excited; but when I see her trampled\\nunderfoot, I am angry at the authors of her disgrace. ‘I did not notice\\nthat you were more excited than you ought to have been.’ But I felt\\nthat I was. Now do not let us forget another point in the selection of\\nour disciples—that they must be young and not old. For Solon is\\nmistaken in saying that an old man can be always learning; youth is the\\ntime of study, and here we must remember that the mind is free and\\ndainty, and, unlike the body, must not be made to work against the\\ngrain. Learning should be at first a sort of play, in which the natural\\nbent is detected. As in training them for war, the young dogs should at\\nfirst only taste blood; but when the necessary gymnastics are over\\nwhich during two or three years divide life between sleep and bodily\\nexercise, then the education of the soul will become a more serious\\nmatter. At twenty years of age, a selection must be made of the more\\npromising disciples, with whom a new epoch of education will begin. The\\nsciences which they have hitherto learned in fragments will now be\\nbrought into relation with each other and with true being; for the\\npower of combining them is the test of speculative and dialectical\\nability. And afterwards at thirty a further selection shall be made of\\nthose who are able to withdraw from the world of sense into the\\nabstraction of ideas. But at this point, judging from present\\nexperience, there is a danger that dialectic may be the source of many\\nevils. The danger may be illustrated by a parallel case:—Imagine a\\nperson who has been brought up in wealth and luxury amid a crowd of\\nflatterers, and who is suddenly informed that he is a supposititious\\nson. He has hitherto honoured his reputed parents and disregarded the\\nflatterers, and now he does the reverse. This is just what happens with\\na man’s principles. There are certain doctrines which he learnt at home\\nand which exercised a parental authority over him. Presently he finds\\nthat imputations are cast upon them; a troublesome querist comes and\\nasks, ‘What is the just and good?’ or proves that virtue is vice and\\nvice virtue, and his mind becomes unsettled, and he ceases to love,\\nhonour, and obey them as he has hitherto done. He is seduced into the\\nlife of pleasure, and becomes a lawless person and a rogue. The case of\\nsuch speculators is very pitiable, and, in order that our thirty years’\\nold pupils may not require this pity, let us take every possible care\\nthat young persons do not study philosophy too early. For a young man\\nis a sort of puppy who only plays with an argument; and is reasoned\\ninto and out of his opinions every day; he soon begins to believe\\nnothing, and brings himself and philosophy into discredit. A man of\\nthirty does not run on in this way; he will argue and not merely\\ncontradict, and adds new honour to philosophy by the sobriety of his\\nconduct. What time shall we allow for this second gymnastic training of\\nthe soul?—say, twice the time required for the gymnastics of the body;\\nsix, or perhaps five years, to commence at thirty, and then for fifteen\\nyears let the student go down into the den, and command armies, and\\ngain experience of life. At fifty let him return to the end of all\\nthings, and have his eyes uplifted to the idea of good, and order his\\nlife after that pattern; if necessary, taking his turn at the helm of\\nState, and training up others to be his successors. When his time comes\\nhe shall depart in peace to the islands of the blest. He shall be\\nhonoured with sacrifices, and receive such worship as the Pythian\\noracle approves.\\n\\n‘You are a statuary, Socrates, and have made a perfect image of our\\ngovernors.’ Yes, and of our governesses, for the women will share in\\nall things with the men. And you will admit that our State is not a\\nmere aspiration, but may really come into being when there shall arise\\nphilosopher-kings, one or more, who will despise earthly vanities, and\\nwill be the servants of justice only. ‘And how will they begin their\\nwork?’ Their first act will be to send away into the country all those\\nwho are more than ten years of age, and to proceed with those who are\\nleft...\\n\\nAt the commencement of the sixth book, Plato anticipated his\\nexplanation of the relation of the philosopher to the world in an\\nallegory, in this, as in other passages, following the order which he\\nprescribes in education, and proceeding from the concrete to the\\nabstract. At the commencement of Book VII, under the figure of a cave\\nhaving an opening towards a fire and a way upwards to the true light,\\nhe returns to view the divisions of knowledge, exhibiting familiarly,\\nas in a picture, the result which had been hardly won by a great effort\\nof thought in the previous discussion; at the same time casting a\\nglance onward at the dialectical process, which is represented by the\\nway leading from darkness to light. The shadows, the images, the\\nreflection of the sun and stars in the water, the stars and sun\\nthemselves, severally correspond,—the first, to the realm of fancy and\\npoetry,—the second, to the world of sense,—the third, to the\\nabstractions or universals of sense, of which the mathematical sciences\\nfurnish the type,—the fourth and last to the same abstractions, when\\nseen in the unity of the idea, from which they derive a new meaning and\\npower. The true dialectical process begins with the contemplation of\\nthe real stars, and not mere reflections of them, and ends with the\\nrecognition of the sun, or idea of good, as the parent not only of\\nlight but of warmth and growth. To the divisions of knowledge the\\nstages of education partly answer:—first, there is the early education\\nof childhood and youth in the fancies of the poets, and in the laws and\\ncustoms of the State;—then there is the training of the body to be a\\nwarrior athlete, and a good servant of the mind;—and thirdly, after an\\ninterval follows the education of later life, which begins with\\nmathematics and proceeds to philosophy in general.\\n\\nThere seem to be two great aims in the philosophy of Plato,—first, to\\nrealize abstractions; secondly, to connect them. According to him, the\\ntrue education is that which draws men from becoming to being, and to a\\ncomprehensive survey of all being. He desires to develop in the human\\nmind the faculty of seeing the universal in all things; until at last\\nthe particulars of sense drop away and the universal alone remains. He\\nthen seeks to combine the universals which he has disengaged from\\nsense, not perceiving that the correlation of them has no other basis\\nbut the common use of language. He never understands that abstractions,\\nas Hegel says, are ‘mere abstractions’—of use when employed in the\\narrangement of facts, but adding nothing to the sum of knowledge when\\npursued apart from them, or with reference to an imaginary idea of\\ngood. Still the exercise of the faculty of abstraction apart from facts\\nhas enlarged the mind, and played a great part in the education of the\\nhuman race. Plato appreciated the value of this faculty, and saw that\\nit might be quickened by the study of number and relation. All things\\nin which there is opposition or proportion are suggestive of\\nreflection. The mere impression of sense evokes no power of thought or\\nof mind, but when sensible objects ask to be compared and\\ndistinguished, then philosophy begins. The science of arithmetic first\\nsuggests such distinctions. The follow in order the other sciences of\\nplain and solid geometry, and of solids in motion, one branch of which\\nis astronomy or the harmony of the spheres,—to this is appended the\\nsister science of the harmony of sounds. Plato seems also to hint at\\nthe possibility of other applications of arithmetical or mathematical\\nproportions, such as we employ in chemistry and natural philosophy,\\nsuch as the Pythagoreans and even Aristotle make use of in Ethics and\\nPolitics, e.g. his distinction between arithmetical and geometrical\\nproportion in the Ethics (Book V), or between numerical and\\nproportional equality in the Politics.\\n\\nThe modern mathematician will readily sympathise with Plato’s delight\\nin the properties of pure mathematics. He will not be disinclined to\\nsay with him:—Let alone the heavens, and study the beauties of number\\nand figure in themselves. He too will be apt to depreciate their\\napplication to the arts. He will observe that Plato has a conception of\\ngeometry, in which figures are to be dispensed with; thus in a distant\\nand shadowy way seeming to anticipate the possibility of working\\ngeometrical problems by a more general mode of analysis. He will remark\\nwith interest on the backward state of solid geometry, which, alas! was\\nnot encouraged by the aid of the State in the age of Plato; and he will\\nrecognize the grasp of Plato’s mind in his ability to conceive of one\\nscience of solids in motion including the earth as well as the\\nheavens,—not forgetting to notice the intimation to which allusion has\\nbeen already made, that besides astronomy and harmonics the science of\\nsolids in motion may have other applications. Still more will he be\\nstruck with the comprehensiveness of view which led Plato, at a time\\nwhen these sciences hardly existed, to say that they must be studied in\\nrelation to one another, and to the idea of good, or common principle\\nof truth and being. But he will also see (and perhaps without surprise)\\nthat in that stage of physical and mathematical knowledge, Plato has\\nfallen into the error of supposing that he can construct the heavens a\\npriori by mathematical problems, and determine the principles of\\nharmony irrespective of the adaptation of sounds to the human ear. The\\nillusion was a natural one in that age and country. The simplicity and\\ncertainty of astronomy and harmonics seemed to contrast with the\\nvariation and complexity of the world of sense; hence the circumstance\\nthat there was some elementary basis of fact, some measurement of\\ndistance or time or vibrations on which they must ultimately rest, was\\noverlooked by him. The modern predecessors of Newton fell into errors\\nequally great; and Plato can hardly be said to have been very far\\nwrong, or may even claim a sort of prophetic insight into the subject,\\nwhen we consider that the greater part of astronomy at the present day\\nconsists of abstract dynamics, by the help of which most astronomical\\ndiscoveries have been made.\\n\\nThe metaphysical philosopher from his point of view recognizes\\nmathematics as an instrument of education,—which strengthens the power\\nof attention, developes the sense of order and the faculty of\\nconstruction, and enables the mind to grasp under simple formulae the\\nquantitative differences of physical phenomena. But while acknowledging\\ntheir value in education, he sees also that they have no connexion with\\nour higher moral and intellectual ideas. In the attempt which Plato\\nmakes to connect them, we easily trace the influences of ancient\\nPythagorean notions. There is no reason to suppose that he is speaking\\nof the ideal numbers; but he is describing numbers which are pure\\nabstractions, to which he assigns a real and separate existence, which,\\nas ‘the teachers of the art’ (meaning probably the Pythagoreans) would\\nhave affirmed, repel all attempts at subdivision, and in which unity\\nand every other number are conceived of as absolute. The truth and\\ncertainty of numbers, when thus disengaged from phenomena, gave them a\\nkind of sacredness in the eyes of an ancient philosopher. Nor is it\\neasy to say how far ideas of order and fixedness may have had a moral\\nand elevating influence on the minds of men, ‘who,’ in the words of the\\nTimaeus, ‘might learn to regulate their erring lives according to\\nthem.’ It is worthy of remark that the old Pythagorean ethical symbols\\nstill exist as figures of speech among ourselves. And those who in\\nmodern times see the world pervaded by universal law, may also see an\\nanticipation of this last word of modern philosophy in the Platonic\\nidea of good, which is the source and measure of all things, and yet\\nonly an abstraction (Philebus).\\n\\nTwo passages seem to require more particular explanations. First, that\\nwhich relates to the analysis of vision. The difficulty in this passage\\nmay be explained, like many others, from differences in the modes of\\nconception prevailing among ancient and modern thinkers. To us, the\\nperceptions of sense are inseparable from the act of the mind which\\naccompanies them. The consciousness of form, colour, distance, is\\nindistinguishable from the simple sensation, which is the medium of\\nthem. Whereas to Plato sense is the Heraclitean flux of sense, not the\\nvision of objects in the order in which they actually present\\nthemselves to the experienced sight, but as they may be imagined to\\nappear confused and blurred to the half-awakened eye of the infant. The\\nfirst action of the mind is aroused by the attempt to set in order this\\nchaos, and the reason is required to frame distinct conceptions under\\nwhich the confused impressions of sense may be arranged. Hence arises\\nthe question, ‘What is great, what is small?’ and thus begins the\\ndistinction of the visible and the intelligible.\\n\\nThe second difficulty relates to Plato’s conception of harmonics. Three\\nclasses of harmonists are distinguished by him:—first, the\\nPythagoreans, whom he proposes to consult as in the previous discussion\\non music he was to consult Damon—they are acknowledged to be masters in\\nthe art, but are altogether deficient in the knowledge of its higher\\nimport and relation to the good; secondly, the mere empirics, whom\\nGlaucon appears to confuse with them, and whom both he and Socrates\\nludicrously describe as experimenting by mere auscultation on the\\nintervals of sounds. Both of these fall short in different degrees of\\nthe Platonic idea of harmony, which must be studied in a purely\\nabstract way, first by the method of problems, and secondly as a part\\nof universal knowledge in relation to the idea of good.\\n\\nThe allegory has a political as well as a philosophical meaning. The\\nden or cave represents the narrow sphere of politics or law (compare\\nthe description of the philosopher and lawyer in the Theaetetus), and\\nthe light of the eternal ideas is supposed to exercise a disturbing\\ninfluence on the minds of those who return to this lower world. In\\nother words, their principles are too wide for practical application;\\nthey are looking far away into the past and future, when their business\\nis with the present. The ideal is not easily reduced to the conditions\\nof actual life, and may often be at variance with them. And at first,\\nthose who return are unable to compete with the inhabitants of the den\\nin the measurement of the shadows, and are derided and persecuted by\\nthem; but after a while they see the things below in far truer\\nproportions than those who have never ascended into the upper world.\\nThe difference between the politician turned into a philosopher and the\\nphilosopher turned into a politician, is symbolized by the two kinds of\\ndisordered eyesight, the one which is experienced by the captive who is\\ntransferred from darkness to day, the other, of the heavenly messenger\\nwho voluntarily for the good of his fellow-men descends into the den.\\nIn what way the brighter light is to dawn on the inhabitants of the\\nlower world, or how the idea of good is to become the guiding principle\\nof politics, is left unexplained by Plato. Like the nature and\\ndivisions of dialectic, of which Glaucon impatiently demands to be\\ninformed, perhaps he would have said that the explanation could not be\\ngiven except to a disciple of the previous sciences. (Symposium.)\\n\\nMany illustrations of this part of the Republic may be found in modern\\nPolitics and in daily life. For among ourselves, too, there have been\\ntwo sorts of Politicians or Statesmen, whose eyesight has become\\ndisordered in two different ways. First, there have been great men who,\\nin the language of Burke, ‘have been too much given to general maxims,’\\nwho, like J.S. Mill or Burke himself, have been theorists or\\nphilosophers before they were politicians, or who, having been students\\nof history, have allowed some great historical parallel, such as the\\nEnglish Revolution of 1688, or possibly Athenian democracy or Roman\\nImperialism, to be the medium through which they viewed contemporary\\nevents. Or perhaps the long projecting shadow of some existing\\ninstitution may have darkened their vision. The Church of the future,\\nthe Commonwealth of the future, the Society of the future, have so\\nabsorbed their minds, that they are unable to see in their true\\nproportions the Politics of to-day. They have been intoxicated with\\ngreat ideas, such as liberty, or equality, or the greatest happiness of\\nthe greatest number, or the brotherhood of humanity, and they no longer\\ncare to consider how these ideas must be limited in practice or\\nharmonized with the conditions of human life. They are full of light,\\nbut the light to them has become only a sort of luminous mist or\\nblindness. Almost every one has known some enthusiastic half-educated\\nperson, who sees everything at false distances, and in erroneous\\nproportions.\\n\\nWith this disorder of eyesight may be contrasted another—of those who\\nsee not far into the distance, but what is near only; who have been\\nengaged all their lives in a trade or a profession; who are limited to\\na set or sect of their own. Men of this kind have no universal except\\ntheir own interests or the interests of their class, no principle but\\nthe opinion of persons like themselves, no knowledge of affairs beyond\\nwhat they pick up in the streets or at their club. Suppose them to be\\nsent into a larger world, to undertake some higher calling, from being\\ntradesmen to turn generals or politicians, from being schoolmasters to\\nbecome philosophers:—or imagine them on a sudden to receive an inward\\nlight which reveals to them for the first time in their lives a higher\\nidea of God and the existence of a spiritual world, by this sudden\\nconversion or change is not their daily life likely to be upset; and on\\nthe other hand will not many of their old prejudices and narrownesses\\nstill adhere to them long after they have begun to take a more\\ncomprehensive view of human things? From familiar examples like these\\nwe may learn what Plato meant by the eyesight which is liable to two\\nkinds of disorders.\\n\\nNor have we any difficulty in drawing a parallel between the young\\nAthenian in the fifth century before Christ who became unsettled by new\\nideas, and the student of a modern University who has been the subject\\nof a similar ‘aufklärung.’ We too observe that when young men begin to\\ncriticise customary beliefs, or to analyse the constitution of human\\nnature, they are apt to lose hold of solid principle (ἅπαν τὸ βέβαιον\\nαὐτῶν ἐξοίχεται). They are like trees which have been frequently\\ntransplanted. The earth about them is loose, and they have no roots\\nreaching far into the soil. They ‘light upon every flower,’ following\\ntheir own wayward wills, or because the wind blows them. They catch\\nopinions, as diseases are caught—when they are in the air. Borne hither\\nand thither, ‘they speedily fall into beliefs’ the opposite of those in\\nwhich they were brought up. They hardly retain the distinction of right\\nand wrong; they seem to think one thing as good as another. They\\nsuppose themselves to be searching after truth when they are playing\\nthe game of ‘follow my leader.’ They fall in love ‘at first sight’ with\\nparadoxes respecting morality, some fancy about art, some novelty or\\neccentricity in religion, and like lovers they are so absorbed for a\\ntime in their new notion that they can think of nothing else. The\\nresolution of some philosophical or theological question seems to them\\nmore interesting and important than any substantial knowledge of\\nliterature or science or even than a good life. Like the youth in the\\nPhilebus, they are ready to discourse to any one about a new\\nphilosophy. They are generally the disciples of some eminent professor\\nor sophist, whom they rather imitate than understand. They may be\\ncounted happy if in later years they retain some of the simple truths\\nwhich they acquired in early education, and which they may, perhaps,\\nfind to be worth all the rest. Such is the picture which Plato draws\\nand which we only reproduce, partly in his own words, of the dangers\\nwhich beset youth in times of transition, when old opinions are fading\\naway and the new are not yet firmly established. Their condition is\\ningeniously compared by him to that of a supposititious son, who has\\nmade the discovery that his reputed parents are not his real ones, and,\\nin consequence, they have lost their authority over him.\\n\\nThe distinction between the mathematician and the dialectician is also\\nnoticeable. Plato is very well aware that the faculty of the\\nmathematician is quite distinct from the higher philosophical sense\\nwhich recognizes and combines first principles. The contempt which he\\nexpresses for distinctions of words, the danger of involuntary\\nfalsehood, the apology which Socrates makes for his earnestness of\\nspeech, are highly characteristic of the Platonic style and mode of\\nthought. The quaint notion that if Palamedes was the inventor of number\\nAgamemnon could not have counted his feet; the art by which we are made\\nto believe that this State of ours is not a dream only; the gravity\\nwith which the first step is taken in the actual creation of the State,\\nnamely, the sending out of the city all who had arrived at ten years of\\nage, in order to expedite the business of education by a generation,\\nare also truly Platonic. (For the last, compare the passage at the end\\nof the third book, in which he expects the lie about the earthborn men\\nto be believed in the second generation.)\\n\\nBOOK VIII. And so we have arrived at the conclusion, that in the\\nperfect State wives and children are to be in common; and the education\\nand pursuits of men and women, both in war and peace, are to be common,\\nand kings are to be philosophers and warriors, and the soldiers of the\\nState are to live together, having all things in common; and they are\\nto be warrior athletes, receiving no pay but only their food, from the\\nother citizens. Now let us return to the point at which we digressed.\\n‘That is easily done,’ he replied: ‘You were speaking of the State\\nwhich you had constructed, and of the individual who answered to this,\\nboth of whom you affirmed to be good; and you said that of inferior\\nStates there were four forms and four individuals corresponding to\\nthem, which although deficient in various degrees, were all of them\\nworth inspecting with a view to determining the relative happiness or\\nmisery of the best or worst man. Then Polemarchus and Adeimantus\\ninterrupted you, and this led to another argument,—and so here we are.’\\nSuppose that we put ourselves again in the same position, and do you\\nrepeat your question. ‘I should like to know of what constitutions you\\nwere speaking?’ Besides the perfect State there are only four of any\\nnote in Hellas:—first, the famous Lacedaemonian or Cretan commonwealth;\\nsecondly, oligarchy, a State full of evils; thirdly, democracy, which\\nfollows next in order; fourthly, tyranny, which is the disease or death\\nof all government. Now, States are not made of ‘oak and rock,’ but of\\nflesh and blood; and therefore as there are five States there must be\\nfive human natures in individuals, which correspond to them. And first,\\nthere is the ambitious nature, which answers to the Lacedaemonian\\nState; secondly, the oligarchical nature; thirdly, the democratical;\\nand fourthly, the tyrannical. This last will have to be compared with\\nthe perfectly just, which is the fifth, that we may know which is the\\nhappier, and then we shall be able to determine whether the argument of\\nThrasymachus or our own is the more convincing. And as before we began\\nwith the State and went on to the individual, so now, beginning with\\ntimocracy, let us go on to the timocratical man, and then proceed to\\nthe other forms of government, and the individuals who answer to them.\\n\\nBut how did timocracy arise out of the perfect State? Plainly, like all\\nchanges of government, from division in the rulers. But whence came\\ndivision? ‘Sing, heavenly Muses,’ as Homer says;—let them condescend to\\nanswer us, as if we were children, to whom they put on a solemn face in\\njest. ‘And what will they say?’ They will say that human things are\\nfated to decay, and even the perfect State will not escape from this\\nlaw of destiny, when ‘the wheel comes full circle’ in a period short or\\nlong. Plants or animals have times of fertility and sterility, which\\nthe intelligence of rulers because alloyed by sense will not enable\\nthem to ascertain, and children will be born out of season. For whereas\\ndivine creations are in a perfect cycle or number, the human creation\\nis in a number which declines from perfection, and has four terms and\\nthree intervals of numbers, increasing, waning, assimilating,\\ndissimilating, and yet perfectly commensurate with each other. The base\\nof the number with a fourth added (or which is 3:4), multiplied by five\\nand cubed, gives two harmonies:—the first a square number, which is a\\nhundred times the base (or a hundred times a hundred); the second, an\\noblong, being a hundred squares of the rational diameter of a figure\\nthe side of which is five, subtracting one from each square or two\\nperfect squares from all, and adding a hundred cubes of three. This\\nentire number is geometrical and contains the rule or law of\\ngeneration. When this law is neglected marriages will be unpropitious;\\nthe inferior offspring who are then born will in time become the\\nrulers; the State will decline, and education fall into decay;\\ngymnastic will be preferred to music, and the gold and silver and brass\\nand iron will form a chaotic mass—thus division will arise. Such is the\\nMuses’ answer to our question. ‘And a true answer, of course:—but what\\nmore have they to say?’ They say that the two races, the iron and\\nbrass, and the silver and gold, will draw the State different ways;—the\\none will take to trade and moneymaking, and the others, having the true\\nriches and not caring for money, will resist them: the contest will end\\nin a compromise; they will agree to have private property, and will\\nenslave their fellow-citizens who were once their friends and\\nnurturers. But they will retain their warlike character, and will be\\nchiefly occupied in fighting and exercising rule. Thus arises\\ntimocracy, which is intermediate between aristocracy and oligarchy.\\n\\nThe new form of government resembles the ideal in obedience to rulers\\nand contempt for trade, and having common meals, and in devotion to\\nwarlike and gymnastic exercises. But corruption has crept into\\nphilosophy, and simplicity of character, which was once her note, is\\nnow looked for only in the military class. Arts of war begin to prevail\\nover arts of peace; the ruler is no longer a philosopher; as in\\noligarchies, there springs up among them an extravagant love of\\ngain—get another man’s and save your own, is their principle; and they\\nhave dark places in which they hoard their gold and silver, for the use\\nof their women and others; they take their pleasures by stealth, like\\nboys who are running away from their father—the law; and their\\neducation is not inspired by the Muse, but imposed by the strong arm of\\npower. The leading characteristic of this State is party spirit and\\nambition.\\n\\nAnd what manner of man answers to such a State? ‘In love of\\ncontention,’ replied Adeimantus, ‘he will be like our friend Glaucon.’\\nIn that respect, perhaps, but not in others. He is self-asserting and\\nill-educated, yet fond of literature, although not himself a\\nspeaker,—fierce with slaves, but obedient to rulers, a lover of power\\nand honour, which he hopes to gain by deeds of arms,—fond, too, of\\ngymnastics and of hunting. As he advances in years he grows avaricious,\\nfor he has lost philosophy, which is the only saviour and guardian of\\nmen. His origin is as follows:—His father is a good man dwelling in an\\nill-ordered State, who has retired from politics in order that he may\\nlead a quiet life. His mother is angry at her loss of precedence among\\nother women; she is disgusted at her husband’s selfishness, and she\\nexpatiates to her son on the unmanliness and indolence of his father.\\nThe old family servant takes up the tale, and says to the youth:—‘When\\nyou grow up you must be more of a man than your father.’ All the world\\nare agreed that he who minds his own business is an idiot, while a\\nbusybody is highly honoured and esteemed. The young man compares this\\nspirit with his father’s words and ways, and as he is naturally well\\ndisposed, although he has suffered from evil influences, he rests at a\\nmiddle point and becomes ambitious and a lover of honour.\\n\\nAnd now let us set another city over against another man. The next form\\nof government is oligarchy, in which the rule is of the rich only; nor\\nis it difficult to see how such a State arises. The decline begins with\\nthe possession of gold and silver; illegal modes of expenditure are\\ninvented; one draws another on, and the multitude are infected; riches\\noutweigh virtue; lovers of money take the place of lovers of honour;\\nmisers of politicians; and, in time, political privileges are confined\\nby law to the rich, who do not shrink from violence in order to effect\\ntheir purposes.\\n\\nThus much of the origin,—let us next consider the evils of oligarchy.\\nWould a man who wanted to be safe on a voyage take a bad pilot because\\nhe was rich, or refuse a good one because he was poor? And does not the\\nanalogy apply still more to the State? And there are yet greater evils:\\ntwo nations are struggling together in one—the rich and the poor; and\\nthe rich dare not put arms into the hands of the poor, and are\\nunwilling to pay for defenders out of their own money. And have we not\\nalready condemned that State in which the same persons are warriors as\\nwell as shopkeepers? The greatest evil of all is that a man may sell\\nhis property and have no place in the State; while there is one class\\nwhich has enormous wealth, the other is entirely destitute. But observe\\nthat these destitutes had not really any more of the governing nature\\nin them when they were rich than now that they are poor; they were\\nmiserable spendthrifts always. They are the drones of the hive; only\\nwhereas the actual drone is unprovided by nature with a sting, the\\ntwo-legged things whom we call drones are some of them without stings\\nand some of them have dreadful stings; in other words, there are\\npaupers and there are rogues. These are never far apart; and in\\noligarchical cities, where nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a\\nruler, you will find abundance of both. And this evil state of society\\noriginates in bad education and bad government.\\n\\nLike State, like man,—the change in the latter begins with the\\nrepresentative of timocracy; he walks at first in the ways of his\\nfather, who may have been a statesman, or general, perhaps; and\\npresently he sees him ‘fallen from his high estate,’ the victim of\\ninformers, dying in prison or exile, or by the hand of the executioner.\\nThe lesson which he thus receives, makes him cautious; he leaves\\npolitics, represses his pride, and saves pence. Avarice is enthroned as\\nhis bosom’s lord, and assumes the style of the Great King; the rational\\nand spirited elements sit humbly on the ground at either side, the one\\nimmersed in calculation, the other absorbed in the admiration of\\nwealth. The love of honour turns to love of money; the conversion is\\ninstantaneous. The man is mean, saving, toiling, the slave of one\\npassion which is the master of the rest: Is he not the very image of\\nthe State? He has had no education, or he would never have allowed the\\nblind god of riches to lead the dance within him. And being uneducated\\nhe will have many slavish desires, some beggarly, some knavish,\\nbreeding in his soul. If he is the trustee of an orphan, and has the\\npower to defraud, he will soon prove that he is not without the will,\\nand that his passions are only restrained by fear and not by reason.\\nHence he leads a divided existence; in which the better desires mostly\\nprevail. But when he is contending for prizes and other distinctions,\\nhe is afraid to incur a loss which is to be repaid only by barren\\nhonour; in time of war he fights with a small part of his resources,\\nand usually keeps his money and loses the victory.\\n\\nNext comes democracy and the democratic man, out of oligarchy and the\\noligarchical man. Insatiable avarice is the ruling passion of an\\noligarchy; and they encourage expensive habits in order that they may\\ngain by the ruin of extravagant youth. Thus men of family often lose\\ntheir property or rights of citizenship; but they remain in the city,\\nfull of hatred against the new owners of their estates and ripe for\\nrevolution. The usurer with stooping walk pretends not to see them; he\\npasses by, and leaves his sting—that is, his money—in some other\\nvictim; and many a man has to pay the parent or principal sum\\nmultiplied into a family of children, and is reduced into a state of\\ndronage by him. The only way of diminishing the evil is either to limit\\na man in his use of his property, or to insist that he shall lend at\\nhis own risk. But the ruling class do not want remedies; they care only\\nfor money, and are as careless of virtue as the poorest of the\\ncitizens. Now there are occasions on which the governors and the\\ngoverned meet together,—at festivals, on a journey, voyaging or\\nfighting. The sturdy pauper finds that in the hour of danger he is not\\ndespised; he sees the rich man puffing and panting, and draws the\\nconclusion which he privately imparts to his companions,—‘that our\\npeople are not good for much;’ and as a sickly frame is made ill by a\\nmere touch from without, or sometimes without external impulse is ready\\nto fall to pieces of itself, so from the least cause, or with none at\\nall, the city falls ill and fights a battle for life or death. And\\ndemocracy comes into power when the poor are the victors, killing some\\nand exiling some, and giving equal shares in the government to all the\\nrest.\\n\\nThe manner of life in such a State is that of democrats; there is\\nfreedom and plainness of speech, and every man does what is right in\\nhis own eyes, and has his own way of life. Hence arise the most various\\ndevelopments of character; the State is like a piece of embroidery of\\nwhich the colours and figures are the manners of men, and there are\\nmany who, like women and children, prefer this variety to real beauty\\nand excellence. The State is not one but many, like a bazaar at which\\nyou can buy anything. The great charm is, that you may do as you like;\\nyou may govern if you like, let it alone if you like; go to war and\\nmake peace if you feel disposed, and all quite irrespective of anybody\\nelse. When you condemn men to death they remain alive all the same; a\\ngentleman is desired to go into exile, and he stalks about the streets\\nlike a hero; and nobody sees him or cares for him. Observe, too, how\\ngrandly Democracy sets her foot upon all our fine theories of\\neducation,—how little she cares for the training of her statesmen! The\\nonly qualification which she demands is the profession of patriotism.\\nSuch is democracy;—a pleasing, lawless, various sort of government,\\ndistributing equality to equals and unequals alike.\\n\\nLet us now inspect the individual democrat; and first, as in the case\\nof the State, we will trace his antecedents. He is the son of a miserly\\noligarch, and has been taught by him to restrain the love of\\nunnecessary pleasures. Perhaps I ought to explain this latter\\nterm:—Necessary pleasures are those which are good, and which we cannot\\ndo without; unnecessary pleasures are those which do no good, and of\\nwhich the desire might be eradicated by early training. For example,\\nthe pleasures of eating and drinking are necessary and healthy, up to a\\ncertain point; beyond that point they are alike hurtful to body and\\nmind, and the excess may be avoided. When in excess, they may be\\nrightly called expensive pleasures, in opposition to the useful ones.\\nAnd the drone, as we called him, is the slave of these unnecessary\\npleasures and desires, whereas the miserly oligarch is subject only to\\nthe necessary.\\n\\nThe oligarch changes into the democrat in the following manner:—The\\nyouth who has had a miserly bringing up, gets a taste of the drone’s\\nhoney; he meets with wild companions, who introduce him to every new\\npleasure. As in the State, so in the individual, there are allies on\\nboth sides, temptations from without and passions from within; there is\\nreason also and external influences of parents and friends in alliance\\nwith the oligarchical principle; and the two factions are in violent\\nconflict with one another. Sometimes the party of order prevails, but\\nthen again new desires and new disorders arise, and the whole mob of\\npassions gets possession of the Acropolis, that is to say, the soul,\\nwhich they find void and unguarded by true words and works. Falsehoods\\nand illusions ascend to take their place; the prodigal goes back into\\nthe country of the Lotophagi or drones, and openly dwells there. And if\\nany offer of alliance or parley of individual elders comes from home,\\nthe false spirits shut the gates of the castle and permit no one to\\nenter,—there is a battle, and they gain the victory; and straightway\\nmaking alliance with the desires, they banish modesty, which they call\\nfolly, and send temperance over the border. When the house has been\\nswept and garnished, they dress up the exiled vices, and, crowning them\\nwith garlands, bring them back under new names. Insolence they call\\ngood breeding, anarchy freedom, waste magnificence, impudence courage.\\nSuch is the process by which the youth passes from the necessary\\npleasures to the unnecessary. After a while he divides his time\\nimpartially between them; and perhaps, when he gets older and the\\nviolence of passion has abated, he restores some of the exiles and\\nlives in a sort of equilibrium, indulging first one pleasure and then\\nanother; and if reason comes and tells him that some pleasures are good\\nand honourable, and others bad and vile, he shakes his head and says\\nthat he can make no distinction between them. Thus he lives in the\\nfancy of the hour; sometimes he takes to drink, and then he turns\\nabstainer; he practises in the gymnasium or he does nothing at all;\\nthen again he would be a philosopher or a politician; or again, he\\nwould be a warrior or a man of business; he is\\n\\n‘Every thing by starts and nothing long.’\\n\\n\\nThere remains still the finest and fairest of all men and all\\nStates—tyranny and the tyrant. Tyranny springs from democracy much as\\ndemocracy springs from oligarchy. Both arise from excess; the one from\\nexcess of wealth, the other from excess of freedom. ‘The great natural\\ngood of life,’ says the democrat, ‘is freedom.’ And this exclusive love\\nof freedom and regardlessness of everything else, is the cause of the\\nchange from democracy to tyranny. The State demands the strong wine of\\nfreedom, and unless her rulers give her a plentiful draught, punishes\\nand insults them; equality and fraternity of governors and governed is\\nthe approved principle. Anarchy is the law, not of the State only, but\\nof private houses, and extends even to the animals. Father and son,\\ncitizen and foreigner, teacher and pupil, old and young, are all on a\\nlevel; fathers and teachers fear their sons and pupils, and the wisdom\\nof the young man is a match for the elder, and the old imitate the\\njaunty manners of the young because they are afraid of being thought\\nmorose. Slaves are on a level with their masters and mistresses, and\\nthere is no difference between men and women. Nay, the very animals in\\na democratic State have a freedom which is unknown in other places. The\\nshe-dogs are as good as their she-mistresses, and horses and asses\\nmarch along with dignity and run their noses against anybody who comes\\nin their way. ‘That has often been my experience.’ At last the citizens\\nbecome so sensitive that they cannot endure the yoke of laws, written\\nor unwritten; they would have no man call himself their master. Such is\\nthe glorious beginning of things out of which tyranny springs.\\n‘Glorious, indeed; but what is to follow?’ The ruin of oligarchy is the\\nruin of democracy; for there is a law of contraries; the excess of\\nfreedom passes into the excess of slavery, and the greater the freedom\\nthe greater the slavery. You will remember that in the oligarchy were\\nfound two classes—rogues and paupers, whom we compared to drones with\\nand without stings. These two classes are to the State what phlegm and\\nbile are to the human body; and the State-physician, or legislator,\\nmust get rid of them, just as the bee-master keeps the drones out of\\nthe hive. Now in a democracy, too, there are drones, but they are more\\nnumerous and more dangerous than in the oligarchy; there they are inert\\nand unpractised, here they are full of life and animation; and the\\nkeener sort speak and act, while the others buzz about the bema and\\nprevent their opponents from being heard. And there is another class in\\ndemocratic States, of respectable, thriving individuals, who can be\\nsqueezed when the drones have need of their possessions; there is\\nmoreover a third class, who are the labourers and the artisans, and\\nthey make up the mass of the people. When the people meet, they are\\nomnipotent, but they cannot be brought together unless they are\\nattracted by a little honey; and the rich are made to supply the honey,\\nof which the demagogues keep the greater part themselves, giving a\\ntaste only to the mob. Their victims attempt to resist; they are driven\\nmad by the stings of the drones, and so become downright oligarchs in\\nself-defence. Then follow informations and convictions for treason. The\\npeople have some protector whom they nurse into greatness, and from\\nthis root the tree of tyranny springs. The nature of the change is\\nindicated in the old fable of the temple of Zeus Lycaeus, which tells\\nhow he who tastes human flesh mixed up with the flesh of other victims\\nwill turn into a wolf. Even so the protector, who tastes human blood,\\nand slays some and exiles others with or without law, who hints at\\nabolition of debts and division of lands, must either perish or become\\na wolf—that is, a tyrant. Perhaps he is driven out, but he soon comes\\nback from exile; and then if his enemies cannot get rid of him by\\nlawful means, they plot his assassination. Thereupon the friend of the\\npeople makes his well-known request to them for a body-guard, which\\nthey readily grant, thinking only of his danger and not of their own.\\nNow let the rich man make to himself wings, for he will never run away\\nagain if he does not do so then. And the Great Protector, having\\ncrushed all his rivals, stands proudly erect in the chariot of State, a\\nfull-blown tyrant: Let us enquire into the nature of his happiness.\\n\\nIn the early days of his tyranny he smiles and beams upon everybody; he\\nis not a ‘dominus,’ no, not he: he has only come to put an end to debt\\nand the monopoly of land. Having got rid of foreign enemies, he makes\\nhimself necessary to the State by always going to war. He is thus\\nenabled to depress the poor by heavy taxes, and so keep them at work;\\nand he can get rid of bolder spirits by handing them over to the enemy.\\nThen comes unpopularity; some of his old associates have the courage to\\noppose him. The consequence is, that he has to make a purgation of the\\nState; but, unlike the physician who purges away the bad, he must get\\nrid of the high-spirited, the wise and the wealthy; for he has no\\nchoice between death and a life of shame and dishonour. And the more\\nhated he is, the more he will require trusty guards; but how will he\\nobtain them? ‘They will come flocking like birds—for pay.’ Will he not\\nrather obtain them on the spot? He will take the slaves from their\\nowners and make them his body-guard; these are his trusted friends, who\\nadmire and look up to him. Are not the tragic poets wise who magnify\\nand exalt the tyrant, and say that he is wise by association with the\\nwise? And are not their praises of tyranny alone a sufficient reason\\nwhy we should exclude them from our State? They may go to other cities,\\nand gather the mob about them with fine words, and change commonwealths\\ninto tyrannies and democracies, receiving honours and rewards for their\\nservices; but the higher they and their friends ascend constitution\\nhill, the more their honour will fail and become ‘too asthmatic to\\nmount.’ To return to the tyrant—How will he support that rare army of\\nhis? First, by robbing the temples of their treasures, which will\\nenable him to lighten the taxes; then he will take all his father’s\\nproperty, and spend it on his companions, male or female. Now his\\nfather is the demus, and if the demus gets angry, and says that a great\\nhulking son ought not to be a burden on his parents, and bids him and\\nhis riotous crew begone, then will the parent know what a monster he\\nhas been nurturing, and that the son whom he would fain expel is too\\nstrong for him. ‘You do not mean to say that he will beat his father?’\\nYes, he will, after having taken away his arms. ‘Then he is a parricide\\nand a cruel, unnatural son.’ And the people have jumped from the fear\\nof slavery into slavery, out of the smoke into the fire. Thus liberty,\\nwhen out of all order and reason, passes into the worst form of\\nservitude...\\n\\nIn the previous books Plato has described the ideal State; now he\\nreturns to the perverted or declining forms, on which he had lightly\\ntouched at the end of Book IV. These he describes in a succession of\\nparallels between the individuals and the States, tracing the origin of\\neither in the State or individual which has preceded them. He begins by\\nasking the point at which he digressed; and is thus led shortly to\\nrecapitulate the substance of the three former books, which also\\ncontain a parallel of the philosopher and the State.\\n\\nOf the first decline he gives no intelligible account; he would not\\nhave liked to admit the most probable causes of the fall of his ideal\\nState, which to us would appear to be the impracticability of communism\\nor the natural antagonism of the ruling and subject classes. He throws\\na veil of mystery over the origin of the decline, which he attributes\\nto ignorance of the law of population. Of this law the famous\\ngeometrical figure or number is the expression. Like the ancients in\\ngeneral, he had no idea of the gradual perfectibility of man or of the\\neducation of the human race. His ideal was not to be attained in the\\ncourse of ages, but was to spring in full armour from the head of the\\nlegislator. When good laws had been given, he thought only of the\\nmanner in which they were likely to be corrupted, or of how they might\\nbe filled up in detail or restored in accordance with their original\\nspirit. He appears not to have reflected upon the full meaning of his\\nown words, ‘In the brief space of human life, nothing great can be\\naccomplished’; or again, as he afterwards says in the Laws, ‘Infinite\\ntime is the maker of cities.’ The order of constitutions which is\\nadopted by him represents an order of thought rather than a succession\\nof time, and may be considered as the first attempt to frame a\\nphilosophy of history.\\n\\nThe first of these declining States is timocracy, or the government of\\nsoldiers and lovers of honour, which answers to the Spartan State; this\\nis a government of force, in which education is not inspired by the\\nMuses, but imposed by the law, and in which all the finer elements of\\norganization have disappeared. The philosopher himself has lost the\\nlove of truth, and the soldier, who is of a simpler and honester\\nnature, rules in his stead. The individual who answers to timocracy has\\nsome noticeable qualities. He is described as ill educated, but, like\\nthe Spartan, a lover of literature; and although he is a harsh master\\nto his servants he has no natural superiority over them. His character\\nis based upon a reaction against the circumstances of his father, who\\nin a troubled city has retired from politics; and his mother, who is\\ndissatisfied at her own position, is always urging him towards the life\\nof political ambition. Such a character may have had this origin, and\\nindeed Livy attributes the Licinian laws to a feminine jealousy of a\\nsimilar kind. But there is obviously no connection between the manner\\nin which the timocratic State springs out of the ideal, and the mere\\naccident by which the timocratic man is the son of a retired statesman.\\n\\nThe two next stages in the decline of constitutions have even less\\nhistorical foundation. For there is no trace in Greek history of a\\npolity like the Spartan or Cretan passing into an oligarchy of wealth,\\nor of the oligarchy of wealth passing into a democracy. The order of\\nhistory appears to be different; first, in the Homeric times there is\\nthe royal or patriarchal form of government, which a century or two\\nlater was succeeded by an oligarchy of birth rather than of wealth, and\\nin which wealth was only the accident of the hereditary possession of\\nland and power. Sometimes this oligarchical government gave way to a\\ngovernment based upon a qualification of property, which, according to\\nAristotle’s mode of using words, would have been called a timocracy;\\nand this in some cities, as at Athens, became the conducting medium to\\ndemocracy. But such was not the necessary order of succession in\\nStates; nor, indeed, can any order be discerned in the endless\\nfluctuation of Greek history (like the tides in the Euripus), except,\\nperhaps, in the almost uniform tendency from monarchy to aristocracy in\\nthe earliest times. At first sight there appears to be a similar\\ninversion in the last step of the Platonic succession; for tyranny,\\ninstead of being the natural end of democracy, in early Greek history\\nappears rather as a stage leading to democracy; the reign of\\nPeisistratus and his sons is an episode which comes between the\\nlegislation of Solon and the constitution of Cleisthenes; and some\\nsecret cause common to them all seems to have led the greater part of\\nHellas at her first appearance in the dawn of history, e.g. Athens,\\nArgos, Corinth, Sicyon, and nearly every State with the exception of\\nSparta, through a similar stage of tyranny which ended either in\\noligarchy or democracy. But then we must remember that Plato is\\ndescribing rather the contemporary governments of the Sicilian States,\\nwhich alternated between democracy and tyranny, than the ancient\\nhistory of Athens or Corinth.\\n\\nThe portrait of the tyrant himself is just such as the later Greek\\ndelighted to draw of Phalaris and Dionysius, in which, as in the lives\\nof mediaeval saints or mythic heroes, the conduct and actions of one\\nwere attributed to another in order to fill up the outline. There was\\nno enormity which the Greek was not today to believe of them; the\\ntyrant was the negation of government and law; his assassination was\\nglorious; there was no crime, however unnatural, which might not with\\nprobability be attributed to him. In this, Plato was only following the\\ncommon thought of his countrymen, which he embellished and exaggerated\\nwith all the power of his genius. There is no need to suppose that he\\ndrew from life; or that his knowledge of tyrants is derived from a\\npersonal acquaintance with Dionysius. The manner in which he speaks of\\nthem would rather tend to render doubtful his ever having ‘consorted’\\nwith them, or entertained the schemes, which are attributed to him in\\nthe Epistles, of regenerating Sicily by their help.\\n\\nPlato in a hyperbolical and serio-comic vein exaggerates the follies of\\ndemocracy which he also sees reflected in social life. To him democracy\\nis a state of individualism or dissolution; in which every one is doing\\nwhat is right in his own eyes. Of a people animated by a common spirit\\nof liberty, rising as one man to repel the Persian host, which is the\\nleading idea of democracy in Herodotus and Thucydides, he never seems\\nto think. But if he is not a believer in liberty, still less is he a\\nlover of tyranny. His deeper and more serious condemnation is reserved\\nfor the tyrant, who is the ideal of wickedness and also of weakness,\\nand who in his utter helplessness and suspiciousness is leading an\\nalmost impossible existence, without that remnant of good which, in\\nPlato’s opinion, was required to give power to evil (Book I). This\\nideal of wickedness living in helpless misery, is the reverse of that\\nother portrait of perfect injustice ruling in happiness and splendour,\\nwhich first of all Thrasymachus, and afterwards the sons of Ariston had\\ndrawn, and is also the reverse of the king whose rule of life is the\\ngood of his subjects.\\n\\nEach of these governments and individuals has a corresponding ethical\\ngradation: the ideal State is under the rule of reason, not\\nextinguishing but harmonizing the passions, and training them in\\nvirtue; in the timocracy and the timocratic man the constitution,\\nwhether of the State or of the individual, is based, first, upon\\ncourage, and secondly, upon the love of honour; this latter virtue,\\nwhich is hardly to be esteemed a virtue, has superseded all the rest.\\nIn the second stage of decline the virtues have altogether disappeared,\\nand the love of gain has succeeded to them; in the third stage, or\\ndemocracy, the various passions are allowed to have free play, and the\\nvirtues and vices are impartially cultivated. But this freedom, which\\nleads to many curious extravagances of character, is in reality only a\\nstate of weakness and dissipation. At last, one monster passion takes\\npossession of the whole nature of man—this is tyranny. In all of them\\nexcess—the excess first of wealth and then of freedom, is the element\\nof decay.\\n\\nThe eighth book of the Republic abounds in pictures of life and\\nfanciful allusions; the use of metaphorical language is carried to a\\ngreater extent than anywhere else in Plato. We may remark,\\n\\n(1), the description of the two nations in one, which become more and\\nmore divided in the Greek Republics, as in feudal times, and perhaps\\nalso in our own;\\n\\n(2), the notion of democracy expressed in a sort of Pythagorean formula\\nas equality among unequals;\\n\\n(3), the free and easy ways of men and animals, which are\\ncharacteristic of liberty, as foreign mercenaries and universal\\nmistrust are of the tyrant;\\n\\n(4), the proposal that mere debts should not be recoverable by law is a\\nspeculation which has often been entertained by reformers of the law in\\nmodern times, and is in harmony with the tendencies of modern\\nlegislation. Debt and land were the two great difficulties of the\\nancient lawgiver: in modern times we may be said to have almost, if not\\nquite, solved the first of these difficulties, but hardly the second.\\n\\nStill more remarkable are the corresponding portraits of individuals:\\nthere is the family picture of the father and mother and the old\\nservant of the timocratical man, and the outward respectability and\\ninherent meanness of the oligarchical; the uncontrolled licence and\\nfreedom of the democrat, in which the young Alcibiades seems to be\\ndepicted, doing right or wrong as he pleases, and who at last, like the\\nprodigal, goes into a far country (note here the play of language by\\nwhich the democratic man is himself represented under the image of a\\nState having a citadel and receiving embassies); and there is the\\nwild-beast nature, which breaks loose in his successor. The hit about\\nthe tyrant being a parricide; the representation of the tyrant’s life\\nas an obscene dream; the rhetorical surprise of a more miserable than\\nthe most miserable of men in Book IX; the hint to the poets that if\\nthey are the friends of tyrants there is no place for them in a\\nconstitutional State, and that they are too clever not to see the\\npropriety of their own expulsion; the continuous image of the drones\\nwho are of two kinds, swelling at last into the monster drone having\\nwings (Book IX),—are among Plato’s happiest touches.\\n\\nThere remains to be considered the great difficulty of this book of the\\nRepublic, the so-called number of the State. This is a puzzle almost as\\ngreat as the Number of the Beast in the Book of Revelation, and though\\napparently known to Aristotle, is referred to by Cicero as a proverb of\\nobscurity (Ep. ad Att.). And some have imagined that there is no answer\\nto the puzzle, and that Plato has been practising upon his readers. But\\nsuch a deception as this is inconsistent with the manner in which\\nAristotle speaks of the number (Pol.), and would have been ridiculous\\nto any reader of the Republic who was acquainted with Greek\\nmathematics. As little reason is there for supposing that Plato\\nintentionally used obscure expressions; the obscurity arises from our\\nwant of familiarity with the subject. On the other hand, Plato himself\\nindicates that he is not altogether serious, and in describing his\\nnumber as a solemn jest of the Muses, he appears to imply some degree\\nof satire on the symbolical use of number. (Compare Cratylus; Protag.)\\n\\nOur hope of understanding the passage depends principally on an\\naccurate study of the words themselves; on which a faint light is\\nthrown by the parallel passage in the ninth book. Another help is the\\nallusion in Aristotle, who makes the important remark that the latter\\npart of the passage (Greek) describes a solid figure. (Pol.—‘He only\\nsays that nothing is abiding, but that all things change in a certain\\ncycle; and that the origin of the change is a base of numbers which are\\nin the ratio of 4:3; and this when combined with a figure of five gives\\ntwo harmonies; he means when the number of this figure becomes solid.’)\\nSome further clue may be gathered from the appearance of the\\nPythagorean triangle, which is denoted by the numbers 3, 4, 5, and in\\nwhich, as in every right-angled triangle, the squares of the two lesser\\nsides equal the square of the hypotenuse (9 + 16 = 25).\\n\\nPlato begins by speaking of a perfect or cyclical number (Tim.), i.e. a\\nnumber in which the sum of the divisors equals the whole; this is the\\ndivine or perfect number in which all lesser cycles or revolutions are\\ncomplete. He also speaks of a human or imperfect number, having four\\nterms and three intervals of numbers which are related to one another\\nin certain proportions; these he converts into figures, and finds in\\nthem when they have been raised to the third power certain elements of\\nnumber, which give two ‘harmonies,’ the one square, the other oblong;\\nbut he does not say that the square number answers to the divine, or\\nthe oblong number to the human cycle; nor is any intimation given that\\nthe first or divine number represents the period of the world, the\\nsecond the period of the state, or of the human race as Zeller\\nsupposes; nor is the divine number afterwards mentioned (Arist.). The\\nsecond is the number of generations or births, and presides over them\\nin the same mysterious manner in which the stars preside over them, or\\nin which, according to the Pythagoreans, opportunity, justice,\\nmarriage, are represented by some number or figure. This is probably\\nthe number 216.\\n\\nThe explanation given in the text supposes the two harmonies to make up\\nthe number 8000. This explanation derives a certain plausibility from\\nthe circumstance that 8000 is the ancient number of the Spartan\\ncitizens (Herod.), and would be what Plato might have called ‘a number\\nwhich nearly concerns the population of a city’; the mysterious\\ndisappearance of the Spartan population may possibly have suggested to\\nhim the first cause of his decline of States. The lesser or square\\n‘harmony,’ of 400, might be a symbol of the guardians,—the larger or\\noblong ‘harmony,’ of the people, and the numbers 3, 4, 5 might refer\\nrespectively to the three orders in the State or parts of the soul, the\\nfour virtues, the five forms of government. The harmony of the musical\\nscale, which is elsewhere used as a symbol of the harmony of the state,\\nis also indicated. For the numbers 3, 4, 5, which represent the sides\\nof the Pythagorean triangle, also denote the intervals of the scale.\\n\\nThe terms used in the statement of the problem may be explained as\\nfollows. A perfect number (Greek), as already stated, is one which is\\nequal to the sum of its divisors. Thus 6, which is the first perfect or\\ncyclical number, = 1 + 2 + 3. The words (Greek), ‘terms’ or ‘notes,’\\nand (Greek), ‘intervals,’ are applicable to music as well as to number\\nand figure. (Greek) is the ‘base’ on which the whole calculation\\ndepends, or the ‘lowest term’ from which it can be worked out. The\\nwords (Greek) have been variously translated—‘squared and cubed’\\n(Donaldson), ‘equalling and equalled in power’ (Weber), ‘by involution\\nand evolution,’ i.e. by raising the power and extracting the root (as\\nin the translation). Numbers are called ‘like and unlike’ (Greek) when\\nthe factors or the sides of the planes and cubes which they represent\\nare or are not in the same ratio: e.g. 8 and 27 = 2 cubed and 3 cubed;\\nand conversely. ‘Waxing’ (Greek) numbers, called also ‘increasing’\\n(Greek), are those which are exceeded by the sum of their divisors:\\ne.g. 12 and 18 are less than 16 and 21. ‘Waning’ (Greek) numbers,\\ncalled also ‘decreasing’ (Greek) are those which succeed the sum of\\ntheir divisors: e.g. 8 and 27 exceed 7 and 13. The words translated\\n‘commensurable and agreeable to one another’ (Greek) seem to be\\ndifferent ways of describing the same relation, with more or less\\nprecision. They are equivalent to ‘expressible in terms having the same\\nrelation to one another,’ like the series 8, 12, 18, 27, each of which\\nnumbers is in the relation of (1 and 1/2) to the preceding. The ‘base,’\\nor ‘fundamental number, which has 1/3 added to it’ (1 and 1/3) = 4/3 or\\na musical fourth. (Greek) is a ‘proportion’ of numbers as of musical\\nnotes, applied either to the parts or factors of a single number or to\\nthe relation of one number to another. The first harmony is a ‘square’\\nnumber (Greek); the second harmony is an ‘oblong’ number (Greek), i.e.\\na number representing a figure of which the opposite sides only are\\nequal. (Greek) = ‘numbers squared from’ or ‘upon diameters’; (Greek) =\\n‘rational,’ i.e. omitting fractions, (Greek), ‘irrational,’ i.e.\\nincluding fractions; e.g. 49 is a square of the rational diameter of a\\nfigure the side of which = 5: 50, of an irrational diameter of the\\nsame. For several of the explanations here given and for a good deal\\nbesides I am indebted to an excellent article on the Platonic Number by\\nDr. Donaldson (Proc. of the Philol. Society).\\n\\nThe conclusions which he draws from these data are summed up by him as\\nfollows. Having assumed that the number of the perfect or divine cycle\\nis the number of the world, and the number of the imperfect cycle the\\nnumber of the state, he proceeds: ‘The period of the world is defined\\nby the perfect number 6, that of the state by the cube of that number\\nor 216, which is the product of the last pair of terms in the Platonic\\nTetractys (a series of seven terms, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27); and if we\\ntake this as the basis of our computation, we shall have two cube\\nnumbers (Greek), viz. 8 and 27; and the mean proportionals between\\nthese, viz. 12 and 18, will furnish three intervals and four terms, and\\nthese terms and intervals stand related to one another in the\\nsesqui-altera ratio, i.e. each term is to the preceding as 3/2. Now if\\nwe remember that the number 216 = 8 x 27 = 3 cubed + 4 cubed + 5 cubed,\\nand 3 squared + 4 squared = 5 squared, we must admit that this number\\nimplies the numbers 3, 4, 5, to which musicians attach so much\\nimportance. And if we combine the ratio 4/3 with the number 5, or\\nmultiply the ratios of the sides by the hypotenuse, we shall by first\\nsquaring and then cubing obtain two expressions, which denote the ratio\\nof the two last pairs of terms in the Platonic Tetractys, the former\\nmultiplied by the square, the latter by the cube of the number 10, the\\nsum of the first four digits which constitute the Platonic Tetractys.’\\nThe two (Greek) he elsewhere explains as follows: ‘The first (Greek) is\\n(Greek), in other words (4/3 x 5) all squared = 100 x 2 squared over 3\\nsquared. The second (Greek), a cube of the same root, is described as\\n100 multiplied (alpha) by the rational diameter of 5 diminished by\\nunity, i.e., as shown above, 48: (beta) by two incommensurable\\ndiameters, i.e. the two first irrationals, or 2 and 3: and (gamma) by\\nthe cube of 3, or 27. Thus we have (48 + 5 + 27) 100 = 1000 x 2 cubed.\\nThis second harmony is to be the cube of the number of which the former\\nharmony is the square, and therefore must be divided by the cube of 3.\\nIn other words, the whole expression will be: (1), for the first\\nharmony, 400/9: (2), for the second harmony, 8000/27.’\\n\\nThe reasons which have inclined me to agree with Dr. Donaldson and also\\nwith Schleiermacher in supposing that 216 is the Platonic number of\\nbirths are: (1) that it coincides with the description of the number\\ngiven in the first part of the passage (Greek...): (2) that the number\\n216 with its permutations would have been familiar to a Greek\\nmathematician, though unfamiliar to us: (3) that 216 is the cube of 6,\\nand also the sum of 3 cubed, 4 cubed, 5 cubed, the numbers 3, 4, 5\\nrepresenting the Pythagorean triangle, of which the sides when squared\\nequal the square of the hypotenuse (9 + 16 = 25): (4) that it is also\\nthe period of the Pythagorean Metempsychosis: (5) the three ultimate\\nterms or bases (3, 4, 5) of which 216 is composed answer to the third,\\nfourth, fifth in the musical scale: (6) that the number 216 is the\\nproduct of the cubes of 2 and 3, which are the two last terms in the\\nPlatonic Tetractys: (7) that the Pythagorean triangle is said by\\nPlutarch (de Is. et Osir.), Proclus (super prima Eucl.), and Quintilian\\n(de Musica) to be contained in this passage, so that the tradition of\\nthe school seems to point in the same direction: (8) that the\\nPythagorean triangle is called also the figure of marriage (Greek).\\n\\nBut though agreeing with Dr. Donaldson thus far, I see no reason for\\nsupposing, as he does, that the first or perfect number is the world,\\nthe human or imperfect number the state; nor has he given any proof\\nthat the second harmony is a cube. Nor do I think that (Greek) can mean\\n‘two incommensurables,’ which he arbitrarily assumes to be 2 and 3, but\\nrather, as the preceding clause implies, (Greek), i.e. two square\\nnumbers based upon irrational diameters of a figure the side of which\\nis 5 = 50 x 2.\\n\\nThe greatest objection to the translation is the sense given to the\\nwords (Greek), ‘a base of three with a third added to it, multiplied by\\n5.’ In this somewhat forced manner Plato introduces once more the\\nnumbers of the Pythagorean triangle. But the coincidences in the\\nnumbers which follow are in favour of the explanation. The first\\nharmony of 400, as has been already remarked, probably represents the\\nrulers; the second and oblong harmony of 7600, the people.\\n\\nAnd here we take leave of the difficulty. The discovery of the riddle\\nwould be useless, and would throw no light on ancient mathematics. The\\npoint of interest is that Plato should have used such a symbol, and\\nthat so much of the Pythagorean spirit should have prevailed in him.\\nHis general meaning is that divine creation is perfect, and is\\nrepresented or presided over by a perfect or cyclical number; human\\ngeneration is imperfect, and represented or presided over by an\\nimperfect number or series of numbers. The number 5040, which is the\\nnumber of the citizens in the Laws, is expressly based by him on\\nutilitarian grounds, namely, the convenience of the number for\\ndivision; it is also made up of the first seven digits multiplied by\\none another. The contrast of the perfect and imperfect number may have\\nbeen easily suggested by the corrections of the cycle, which were made\\nfirst by Meton and secondly by Callippus; (the latter is said to have\\nbeen a pupil of Plato). Of the degree of importance or of exactness to\\nbe attributed to the problem, the number of the tyrant in Book IX (729\\n= 365 x 2), and the slight correction of the error in the number\\n5040/12 (Laws), may furnish a criterion. There is nothing surprising in\\nthe circumstance that those who were seeking for order in nature and\\nhad found order in number, should have imagined one to give law to the\\nother. Plato believes in a power of number far beyond what he could see\\nrealized in the world around him, and he knows the great influence\\nwhich ‘the little matter of 1, 2, 3’ exercises upon education. He may\\neven be thought to have a prophetic anticipation of the discoveries of\\nQuetelet and others, that numbers depend upon numbers; e.g.—in\\npopulation, the numbers of births and the respective numbers of\\nchildren born of either sex, on the respective ages of parents, i.e. on\\nother numbers.\\n\\nBOOK IX. Last of all comes the tyrannical man, about whom we have to\\nenquire, Whence is he, and how does he live—in happiness or in misery?\\nThere is, however, a previous question of the nature and number of the\\nappetites, which I should like to consider first. Some of them are\\nunlawful, and yet admit of being chastened and weakened in various\\ndegrees by the power of reason and law. ‘What appetites do you mean?’ I\\nmean those which are awake when the reasoning powers are asleep, which\\nget up and walk about naked without any self-respect or shame; and\\nthere is no conceivable folly or crime, however cruel or unnatural, of\\nwhich, in imagination, they may not be guilty. ‘True,’ he said; ‘very\\ntrue.’ But when a man’s pulse beats temperately; and he has supped on a\\nfeast of reason and come to a knowledge of himself before going to\\nrest, and has satisfied his desires just enough to prevent their\\nperturbing his reason, which remains clear and luminous, and when he is\\nfree from quarrel and heat,—the visions which he has on his bed are\\nleast irregular and abnormal. Even in good men there is such an\\nirregular wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep.\\n\\nTo return:—You remember what was said of the democrat; that he was the\\nson of a miserly father, who encouraged the saving desires and\\nrepressed the ornamental and expensive ones; presently the youth got\\ninto fine company, and began to entertain a dislike to his father’s\\nnarrow ways; and being a better man than the corrupters of his youth,\\nhe came to a mean, and led a life, not of lawless or slavish passion,\\nbut of regular and successive indulgence. Now imagine that the youth\\nhas become a father, and has a son who is exposed to the same\\ntemptations, and has companions who lead him into every sort of\\niniquity, and parents and friends who try to keep him right. The\\ncounsellors of evil find that their only chance of retaining him is to\\nimplant in his soul a monster drone, or love; while other desires buzz\\naround him and mystify him with sweet sounds and scents, this monster\\nlove takes possession of him, and puts an end to every true or modest\\nthought or wish. Love, like drunkenness and madness, is a tyranny; and\\nthe tyrannical man, whether made by nature or habit, is just a\\ndrinking, lusting, furious sort of animal.\\n\\nAnd how does such an one live? ‘Nay, that you must tell me.’ Well then,\\nI fancy that he will live amid revelries and harlotries, and love will\\nbe the lord and master of the house. Many desires require much money,\\nand so he spends all that he has and borrows more; and when he has\\nnothing the young ravens are still in the nest in which they were\\nhatched, crying for food. Love urges them on; and they must be\\ngratified by force or fraud, or if not, they become painful and\\ntroublesome; and as the new pleasures succeed the old ones, so will the\\nson take possession of the goods of his parents; if they show signs of\\nrefusing, he will defraud and deceive them; and if they openly resist,\\nwhat then? ‘I can only say, that I should not much like to be in their\\nplace.’ But, O heavens, Adeimantus, to think that for some new-fangled\\nand unnecessary love he will give up his old father and mother, best\\nand dearest of friends, or enslave them to the fancies of the hour!\\nTruly a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother! When\\nthere is no more to be got out of them, he turns burglar or pickpocket,\\nor robs a temple. Love overmasters the thoughts of his youth, and he\\nbecomes in sober reality the monster that he was sometimes in sleep. He\\nwaxes strong in all violence and lawlessness; and is ready for any deed\\nof daring that will supply the wants of his rabble-rout. In a\\nwell-ordered State there are only a few such, and these in time of war\\ngo out and become the mercenaries of a tyrant. But in time of peace\\nthey stay at home and do mischief; they are the thieves, footpads,\\ncut-purses, man-stealers of the community; or if they are able to\\nspeak, they turn false-witnesses and informers. ‘No small catalogue of\\ncrimes truly, even if the perpetrators are few.’ Yes, I said; but small\\nand great are relative terms, and no crimes which are committed by them\\napproach those of the tyrant, whom this class, growing strong and\\nnumerous, create out of themselves. If the people yield, well and good,\\nbut, if they resist, then, as before he beat his father and mother, so\\nnow he beats his fatherland and motherland, and places his mercenaries\\nover them. Such men in their early days live with flatterers, and they\\nthemselves flatter others, in order to gain their ends; but they soon\\ndiscard their followers when they have no longer any need of them; they\\nare always either masters or servants,—the joys of friendship are\\nunknown to them. And they are utterly treacherous and unjust, if the\\nnature of justice be at all understood by us. They realize our dream;\\nand he who is the most of a tyrant by nature, and leads the life of a\\ntyrant for the longest time, will be the worst of them, and being the\\nworst of them, will also be the most miserable.\\n\\nLike man, like State,—the tyrannical man will answer to tyranny, which\\nis the extreme opposite of the royal State; for one is the best and the\\nother the worst. But which is the happier? Great and terrible as the\\ntyrant may appear enthroned amid his satellites, let us not be afraid\\nto go in and ask; and the answer is, that the monarchical is the\\nhappiest, and the tyrannical the most miserable of States. And may we\\nnot ask the same question about the men themselves, requesting some one\\nto look into them who is able to penetrate the inner nature of man, and\\nwill not be panic-struck by the vain pomp of tyranny? I will suppose\\nthat he is one who has lived with him, and has seen him in family life,\\nor perhaps in the hour of trouble and danger.\\n\\nAssuming that we ourselves are the impartial judge for whom we seek,\\nlet us begin by comparing the individual and State, and ask first of\\nall, whether the State is likely to be free or enslaved—Will there not\\nbe a little freedom and a great deal of slavery? And the freedom is of\\nthe bad, and the slavery of the good; and this applies to the man as\\nwell as to the State; for his soul is full of meanness and slavery, and\\nthe better part is enslaved to the worse. He cannot do what he would,\\nand his mind is full of confusion; he is the very reverse of a freeman.\\nThe State will be poor and full of misery and sorrow; and the man’s\\nsoul will also be poor and full of sorrows, and he will be the most\\nmiserable of men. No, not the most miserable, for there is yet a more\\nmiserable. ‘Who is that?’ The tyrannical man who has the misfortune\\nalso to become a public tyrant. ‘There I suspect that you are right.’\\nSay rather, ‘I am sure;’ conjecture is out of place in an enquiry of\\nthis nature. He is like a wealthy owner of slaves, only he has more of\\nthem than any private individual. You will say, ‘The owners of slaves\\nare not generally in any fear of them.’ But why? Because the whole city\\nis in a league which protects the individual. Suppose however that one\\nof these owners and his household is carried off by a god into a\\nwilderness, where there are no freemen to help him—will he not be in an\\nagony of terror?—will he not be compelled to flatter his slaves and to\\npromise them many things sore against his will? And suppose the same\\ngod who carried him off were to surround him with neighbours who\\ndeclare that no man ought to have slaves, and that the owners of them\\nshould be punished with death. ‘Still worse and worse! He will be in\\nthe midst of his enemies.’ And is not our tyrant such a captive soul,\\nwho is tormented by a swarm of passions which he cannot indulge; living\\nindoors always like a woman, and jealous of those who can go out and\\nsee the world?\\n\\nHaving so many evils, will not the most miserable of men be still more\\nmiserable in a public station? Master of others when he is not master\\nof himself; like a sick man who is compelled to be an athlete; the\\nmeanest of slaves and the most abject of flatterers; wanting all\\nthings, and never able to satisfy his desires; always in fear and\\ndistraction, like the State of which he is the representative. His\\njealous, hateful, faithless temper grows worse with command; he is more\\nand more faithless, envious, unrighteous,—the most wretched of men, a\\nmisery to himself and to others. And so let us have a final trial and\\nproclamation; need we hire a herald, or shall I proclaim the result?\\n‘Made the proclamation yourself.’ The son of Ariston (the best) is of\\nopinion that the best and justest of men is also the happiest, and that\\nthis is he who is the most royal master of himself; and that the unjust\\nman is he who is the greatest tyrant of himself and of his State. And I\\nadd further—‘seen or unseen by gods or men.’\\n\\nThis is our first proof. The second is derived from the three kinds of\\npleasure, which answer to the three elements of the soul—reason,\\npassion, desire; under which last is comprehended avarice as well as\\nsensual appetite, while passion includes ambition, party-feeling, love\\nof reputation. Reason, again, is solely directed to the attainment of\\ntruth, and careless of money and reputation. In accordance with the\\ndifference of men’s natures, one of these three principles is in the\\nascendant, and they have their several pleasures corresponding to them.\\nInterrogate now the three natures, and each one will be found praising\\nhis own pleasures and depreciating those of others. The money-maker\\nwill contrast the vanity of knowledge with the solid advantages of\\nwealth. The ambitious man will despise knowledge which brings no\\nhonour; whereas the philosopher will regard only the fruition of truth,\\nand will call other pleasures necessary rather than good. Now, how\\nshall we decide between them? Is there any better criterion than\\nexperience and knowledge? And which of the three has the truest\\nknowledge and the widest experience? The experience of youth makes the\\nphilosopher acquainted with the two kinds of desire, but the avaricious\\nand the ambitious man never taste the pleasures of truth and wisdom.\\nHonour he has equally with them; they are ‘judged of him,’ but he is\\n‘not judged of them,’ for they never attain to the knowledge of true\\nbeing. And his instrument is reason, whereas their standard is only\\nwealth and honour; and if by reason we are to judge, his good will be\\nthe truest. And so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the\\nrational part of the soul, and a life passed in such pleasure is the\\npleasantest. He who has a right to judge judges thus. Next comes the\\nlife of ambition, and, in the third place, that of money-making.\\n\\nTwice has the just man overthrown the unjust—once more, as in an\\nOlympian contest, first offering up a prayer to the saviour Zeus, let\\nhim try a fall. A wise man whispers to me that the pleasures of the\\nwise are true and pure; all others are a shadow only. Let us examine\\nthis: Is not pleasure opposed to pain, and is there not a mean state\\nwhich is neither? When a man is sick, nothing is more pleasant to him\\nthan health. But this he never found out while he was well. In pain he\\ndesires only to cease from pain; on the other hand, when he is in an\\necstasy of pleasure, rest is painful to him. Thus rest or cessation is\\nboth pleasure and pain. But can that which is neither become both?\\nAgain, pleasure and pain are motions, and the absence of them is rest;\\nbut if so, how can the absence of either of them be the other? Thus we\\nare led to infer that the contradiction is an appearance only, and\\nwitchery of the senses. And these are not the only pleasures, for there\\nare others which have no preceding pains. Pure pleasure then is not the\\nabsence of pain, nor pure pain the absence of pleasure; although most\\nof the pleasures which reach the mind through the body are reliefs of\\npain, and have not only their reactions when they depart, but their\\nanticipations before they come. They can be best described in a simile.\\nThere is in nature an upper, lower, and middle region, and he who\\npasses from the lower to the middle imagines that he is going up and is\\nalready in the upper world; and if he were taken back again would\\nthink, and truly think, that he was descending. All this arises out of\\nhis ignorance of the true upper, middle, and lower regions. And a like\\nconfusion happens with pleasure and pain, and with many other things.\\nThe man who compares grey with black, calls grey white; and the man who\\ncompares absence of pain with pain, calls the absence of pain pleasure.\\nAgain, hunger and thirst are inanitions of the body, ignorance and\\nfolly of the soul; and food is the satisfaction of the one, knowledge\\nof the other. Now which is the purer satisfaction—that of eating and\\ndrinking, or that of knowledge? Consider the matter thus: The\\nsatisfaction of that which has more existence is truer than of that\\nwhich has less. The invariable and immortal has a more real existence\\nthan the variable and mortal, and has a corresponding measure of\\nknowledge and truth. The soul, again, has more existence and truth and\\nknowledge than the body, and is therefore more really satisfied and has\\na more natural pleasure. Those who feast only on earthly food, are\\nalways going at random up to the middle and down again; but they never\\npass into the true upper world, or have a taste of true pleasure. They\\nare like fatted beasts, full of gluttony and sensuality, and ready to\\nkill one another by reason of their insatiable lust; for they are not\\nfilled with true being, and their vessel is leaky (Gorgias). Their\\npleasures are mere shadows of pleasure, mixed with pain, coloured and\\nintensified by contrast, and therefore intensely desired; and men go\\nfighting about them, as Stesichorus says that the Greeks fought about\\nthe shadow of Helen at Troy, because they know not the truth.\\n\\nThe same may be said of the passionate element:—the desires of the\\nambitious soul, as well as of the covetous, have an inferior\\nsatisfaction. Only when under the guidance of reason do either of the\\nother principles do their own business or attain the pleasure which is\\nnatural to them. When not attaining, they compel the other parts of the\\nsoul to pursue a shadow of pleasure which is not theirs. And the more\\ndistant they are from philosophy and reason, the more distant they will\\nbe from law and order, and the more illusive will be their pleasures.\\nThe desires of love and tyranny are the farthest from law, and those of\\nthe king are nearest to it. There is one genuine pleasure, and two\\nspurious ones: the tyrant goes beyond even the latter; he has run away\\naltogether from law and reason. Nor can the measure of his inferiority\\nbe told, except in a figure. The tyrant is the third removed from the\\noligarch, and has therefore, not a shadow of his pleasure, but the\\nshadow of a shadow only. The oligarch, again, is thrice removed from\\nthe king, and thus we get the formula 3 x 3, which is the number of a\\nsurface, representing the shadow which is the tyrant’s pleasure, and if\\nyou like to cube this ‘number of the beast,’ you will find that the\\nmeasure of the difference amounts to 729; the king is 729 times more\\nhappy than the tyrant. And this extraordinary number is NEARLY equal to\\nthe number of days and nights in a year (365 x 2 = 730); and is\\ntherefore concerned with human life. This is the interval between a\\ngood and bad man in happiness only: what must be the difference between\\nthem in comeliness of life and virtue!\\n\\nPerhaps you may remember some one saying at the beginning of our\\ndiscussion that the unjust man was profited if he had the reputation of\\njustice. Now that we know the nature of justice and injustice, let us\\nmake an image of the soul, which will personify his words. First of\\nall, fashion a multitudinous beast, having a ring of heads of all\\nmanner of animals, tame and wild, and able to produce and change them\\nat pleasure. Suppose now another form of a lion, and another of a man;\\nthe second smaller than the first, the third than the second; join them\\ntogether and cover them with a human skin, in which they are completely\\nconcealed. When this has been done, let us tell the supporter of\\ninjustice that he is feeding up the beasts and starving the man. The\\nmaintainer of justice, on the other hand, is trying to strengthen the\\nman; he is nourishing the gentle principle within him, and making an\\nalliance with the lion heart, in order that he may be able to keep down\\nthe many-headed hydra, and bring all into unity with each other and\\nwith themselves. Thus in every point of view, whether in relation to\\npleasure, honour, or advantage, the just man is right, and the unjust\\nwrong.\\n\\nBut now, let us reason with the unjust, who is not intentionally in\\nerror. Is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man, or\\nrather to the God in man; the ignoble, that which subjects the man to\\nthe beast? And if so, who would receive gold on condition that he was\\nto degrade the noblest part of himself under the worst?—who would sell\\nhis son or daughter into the hands of brutal and evil men, for any\\namount of money? And will he sell his own fairer and diviner part\\nwithout any compunction to the most godless and foul? Would he not be\\nworse than Eriphyle, who sold her husband’s life for a necklace? And\\nintemperance is the letting loose of the multiform monster, and pride\\nand sullenness are the growth and increase of the lion and serpent\\nelement, while luxury and effeminacy are caused by a too great\\nrelaxation of spirit. Flattery and meanness again arise when the\\nspirited element is subjected to avarice, and the lion is habituated to\\nbecome a monkey. The real disgrace of handicraft arts is, that those\\nwho are engaged in them have to flatter, instead of mastering their\\ndesires; therefore we say that they should be placed under the control\\nof the better principle in another because they have none in\\nthemselves; not, as Thrasymachus imagined, to the injury of the\\nsubjects, but for their good. And our intention in educating the young,\\nis to give them self-control; the law desires to nurse up in them a\\nhigher principle, and when they have acquired this, they may go their\\nways.\\n\\n‘What, then, shall a man profit, if he gain the whole world’ and become\\nmore and more wicked? Or what shall he profit by escaping discovery, if\\nthe concealment of evil prevents the cure? If he had been punished, the\\nbrute within him would have been silenced, and the gentler element\\nliberated; and he would have united temperance, justice, and wisdom in\\nhis soul—a union better far than any combination of bodily gifts. The\\nman of understanding will honour knowledge above all; in the next place\\nhe will keep under his body, not only for the sake of health and\\nstrength, but in order to attain the most perfect harmony of body and\\nsoul. In the acquisition of riches, too, he will aim at order and\\nharmony; he will not desire to heap up wealth without measure, but he\\nwill fear that the increase of wealth will disturb the constitution of\\nhis own soul. For the same reason he will only accept such honours as\\nwill make him a better man; any others he will decline. ‘In that case,’\\nsaid he, ‘he will never be a politician.’ Yes, but he will, in his own\\ncity; though probably not in his native country, unless by some divine\\naccident. ‘You mean that he will be a citizen of the ideal city, which\\nhas no place upon earth.’ But in heaven, I replied, there is a pattern\\nof such a city, and he who wishes may order his life after that image.\\nWhether such a state is or ever will be matters not; he will act\\naccording to that pattern and no other...\\n\\nThe most noticeable points in the 9th Book of the Republic are:—(1) the\\naccount of pleasure; (2) the number of the interval which divides the\\nking from the tyrant; (3) the pattern which is in heaven.\\n\\n1. Plato’s account of pleasure is remarkable for moderation, and in\\nthis respect contrasts with the later Platonists and the views which\\nare attributed to them by Aristotle. He is not, like the Cynics,\\nopposed to all pleasure, but rather desires that the several parts of\\nthe soul shall have their natural satisfaction; he even agrees with the\\nEpicureans in describing pleasure as something more than the absence of\\npain. This is proved by the circumstance that there are pleasures which\\nhave no antecedent pains (as he also remarks in the Philebus), such as\\nthe pleasures of smell, and also the pleasures of hope and\\nanticipation. In the previous book he had made the distinction between\\nnecessary and unnecessary pleasure, which is repeated by Aristotle, and\\nhe now observes that there are a further class of ‘wild beast’\\npleasures, corresponding to Aristotle’s (Greek). He dwells upon the\\nrelative and unreal character of sensual pleasures and the illusion\\nwhich arises out of the contrast of pleasure and pain, pointing out the\\nsuperiority of the pleasures of reason, which are at rest, over the\\nfleeting pleasures of sense and emotion. The pre-eminence of royal\\npleasure is shown by the fact that reason is able to form a judgment of\\nthe lower pleasures, while the two lower parts of the soul are\\nincapable of judging the pleasures of reason. Thus, in his treatment of\\npleasure, as in many other subjects, the philosophy of Plato is ‘sawn\\nup into quantities’ by Aristotle; the analysis which was originally\\nmade by him became in the next generation the foundation of further\\ntechnical distinctions. Both in Plato and Aristotle we note the\\nillusion under which the ancients fell of regarding the transience of\\npleasure as a proof of its unreality, and of confounding the permanence\\nof the intellectual pleasures with the unchangeableness of the\\nknowledge from which they are derived. Neither do we like to admit that\\nthe pleasures of knowledge, though more elevating, are not more lasting\\nthan other pleasures, and are almost equally dependent on the accidents\\nof our bodily state (Introduction to Philebus).\\n\\n2. The number of the interval which separates the king from the tyrant,\\nand royal from tyrannical pleasures, is 729, the cube of 9. Which Plato\\ncharacteristically designates as a number concerned with human life,\\nbecause NEARLY equivalent to the number of days and nights in the year.\\nHe is desirous of proclaiming that the interval between them is\\nimmeasurable, and invents a formula to give expression to his idea.\\nThose who spoke of justice as a cube, of virtue as an art of measuring\\n(Prot.), saw no inappropriateness in conceiving the soul under the\\nfigure of a line, or the pleasure of the tyrant as separated from the\\npleasure of the king by the numerical interval of 729. And in modern\\ntimes we sometimes use metaphorically what Plato employed as a\\nphilosophical formula. ‘It is not easy to estimate the loss of the\\ntyrant, except perhaps in this way,’ says Plato. So we might say, that\\nalthough the life of a good man is not to be compared to that of a bad\\nman, yet you may measure the difference between them by valuing one\\nminute of the one at an hour of the other (‘One day in thy courts is\\nbetter than a thousand’), or you might say that ‘there is an infinite\\ndifference.’ But this is not so much as saying, in homely phrase, ‘They\\nare a thousand miles asunder.’ And accordingly Plato finds the natural\\nvehicle of his thoughts in a progression of numbers; this arithmetical\\nformula he draws out with the utmost seriousness, and both here and in\\nthe number of generation seems to find an additional proof of the truth\\nof his speculation in forming the number into a geometrical figure;\\njust as persons in our own day are apt to fancy that a statement is\\nverified when it has been only thrown into an abstract form. In\\nspeaking of the number 729 as proper to human life, he probably\\nintended to intimate that one year of the tyrannical = 12 hours of the\\nroyal life.\\n\\nThe simple observation that the comparison of two similar solids is\\neffected by the comparison of the cubes of their sides, is the\\nmathematical groundwork of this fanciful expression. There is some\\ndifficulty in explaining the steps by which the number 729 is obtained;\\nthe oligarch is removed in the third degree from the royal and\\naristocratical, and the tyrant in the third degree from the\\noligarchical; but we have to arrange the terms as the sides of a square\\nand to count the oligarch twice over, thus reckoning them not as = 5\\nbut as = 9. The square of 9 is passed lightly over as only a step\\ntowards the cube.\\n\\n3. Towards the close of the Republic, Plato seems to be more and more\\nconvinced of the ideal character of his own speculations. At the end of\\nthe 9th Book the pattern which is in heaven takes the place of the city\\nof philosophers on earth. The vision which has received form and\\nsubstance at his hands, is now discovered to be at a distance. And yet\\nthis distant kingdom is also the rule of man’s life. (‘Say not lo!\\nhere, or lo! there, for the kingdom of God is within you.’) Thus a note\\nis struck which prepares for the revelation of a future life in the\\nfollowing Book. But the future life is present still; the ideal of\\npolitics is to be realized in the individual.\\n\\nBOOK X. Many things pleased me in the order of our State, but there was\\nnothing which I liked better than the regulation about poetry. The\\ndivision of the soul throws a new light on our exclusion of imitation.\\nI do not mind telling you in confidence that all poetry is an outrage\\non the understanding, unless the hearers have that balm of knowledge\\nwhich heals error. I have loved Homer ever since I was a boy, and even\\nnow he appears to me to be the great master of tragic poetry. But much\\nas I love the man, I love truth more, and therefore I must speak out:\\nand first of all, will you explain what is imitation, for really I do\\nnot understand? ‘How likely then that I should understand!’ That might\\nvery well be, for the duller often sees better than the keener eye.\\n‘True, but in your presence I can hardly venture to say what I think.’\\nThen suppose that we begin in our old fashion, with the doctrine of\\nuniversals. Let us assume the existence of beds and tables. There is\\none idea of a bed, or of a table, which the maker of each had in his\\nmind when making them; he did not make the ideas of beds and tables,\\nbut he made beds and tables according to the ideas. And is there not a\\nmaker of the works of all workmen, who makes not only vessels but\\nplants and animals, himself, the earth and heaven, and things in heaven\\nand under the earth? He makes the Gods also. ‘He must be a wizard\\nindeed!’ But do you not see that there is a sense in which you could do\\nthe same? You have only to take a mirror, and catch the reflection of\\nthe sun, and the earth, or anything else—there now you have made them.\\n‘Yes, but only in appearance.’ Exactly so; and the painter is such a\\ncreator as you are with the mirror, and he is even more unreal than the\\ncarpenter; although neither the carpenter nor any other artist can be\\nsupposed to make the absolute bed. ‘Not if philosophers may be\\nbelieved.’ Nor need we wonder that his bed has but an imperfect\\nrelation to the truth. Reflect:—Here are three beds; one in nature,\\nwhich is made by God; another, which is made by the carpenter; and the\\nthird, by the painter. God only made one, nor could he have made more\\nthan one; for if there had been two, there would always have been a\\nthird—more absolute and abstract than either, under which they would\\nhave been included. We may therefore conceive God to be the natural\\nmaker of the bed, and in a lower sense the carpenter is also the maker;\\nbut the painter is rather the imitator of what the other two make; he\\nhas to do with a creation which is thrice removed from reality. And the\\ntragic poet is an imitator, and, like every other imitator, is thrice\\nremoved from the king and from the truth. The painter imitates not the\\noriginal bed, but the bed made by the carpenter. And this, without\\nbeing really different, appears to be different, and has many points of\\nview, of which only one is caught by the painter, who represents\\neverything because he represents a piece of everything, and that piece\\nan image. And he can paint any other artist, although he knows nothing\\nof their arts; and this with sufficient skill to deceive children or\\nsimple people. Suppose now that somebody came to us and told us, how he\\nhad met a man who knew all that everybody knows, and better than\\nanybody:—should we not infer him to be a simpleton who, having no\\ndiscernment of truth and falsehood, had met with a wizard or enchanter,\\nwhom he fancied to be all-wise? And when we hear persons saying that\\nHomer and the tragedians know all the arts and all the virtues, must we\\nnot infer that they are under a similar delusion? they do not see that\\nthe poets are imitators, and that their creations are only imitations.\\n‘Very true.’ But if a person could create as well as imitate, he would\\nrather leave some permanent work and not an imitation only; he would\\nrather be the receiver than the giver of praise? ‘Yes, for then he\\nwould have more honour and advantage.’\\n\\nLet us now interrogate Homer and the poets. Friend Homer, say I to him,\\nI am not going to ask you about medicine, or any art to which your\\npoems incidentally refer, but about their main subjects—war, military\\ntactics, politics. If you are only twice and not thrice removed from\\nthe truth—not an imitator or an image-maker, please to inform us what\\ngood you have ever done to mankind? Is there any city which professes\\nto have received laws from you, as Sicily and Italy have from\\nCharondas, Sparta from Lycurgus, Athens from Solon? Or was any war ever\\ncarried on by your counsels? or is any invention attributed to you, as\\nthere is to Thales and Anacharsis? Or is there any Homeric way of life,\\nsuch as the Pythagorean was, in which you instructed men, and which is\\ncalled after you? ‘No, indeed; and Creophylus (Flesh-child) was even\\nmore unfortunate in his breeding than he was in his name, if, as\\ntradition says, Homer in his lifetime was allowed by him and his other\\nfriends to starve.’ Yes, but could this ever have happened if Homer had\\nreally been the educator of Hellas? Would he not have had many devoted\\nfollowers? If Protagoras and Prodicus can persuade their contemporaries\\nthat no one can manage house or State without them, is it likely that\\nHomer and Hesiod would have been allowed to go about as beggars—I mean\\nif they had really been able to do the world any good?—would not men\\nhave compelled them to stay where they were, or have followed them\\nabout in order to get education? But they did not; and therefore we may\\ninfer that Homer and all the poets are only imitators, who do but\\nimitate the appearances of things. For as a painter by a knowledge of\\nfigure and colour can paint a cobbler without any practice in cobbling,\\nso the poet can delineate any art in the colours of language, and give\\nharmony and rhythm to the cobbler and also to the general; and you know\\nhow mere narration, when deprived of the ornaments of metre, is like a\\nface which has lost the beauty of youth and never had any other. Once\\nmore, the imitator has no knowledge of reality, but only of appearance.\\nThe painter paints, and the artificer makes a bridle and reins, but\\nneither understands the use of them—the knowledge of this is confined\\nto the horseman; and so of other things. Thus we have three arts: one\\nof use, another of invention, a third of imitation; and the user\\nfurnishes the rule to the two others. The flute-player will know the\\ngood and bad flute, and the maker will put faith in him; but the\\nimitator will neither know nor have faith—neither science nor true\\nopinion can be ascribed to him. Imitation, then, is devoid of\\nknowledge, being only a kind of play or sport, and the tragic and epic\\npoets are imitators in the highest degree.\\n\\nAnd now let us enquire, what is the faculty in man which answers to\\nimitation. Allow me to explain my meaning: Objects are differently seen\\nwhen in the water and when out of the water, when near and when at a\\ndistance; and the painter or juggler makes use of this variation to\\nimpose upon us. And the art of measuring and weighing and calculating\\ncomes in to save our bewildered minds from the power of appearance;\\nfor, as we were saying, two contrary opinions of the same about the\\nsame and at the same time, cannot both of them be true. But which of\\nthem is true is determined by the art of calculation; and this is\\nallied to the better faculty in the soul, as the arts of imitation are\\nto the worse. And the same holds of the ear as well as of the eye, of\\npoetry as well as painting. The imitation is of actions voluntary or\\ninvoluntary, in which there is an expectation of a good or bad result,\\nand present experience of pleasure and pain. But is a man in harmony\\nwith himself when he is the subject of these conflicting influences? Is\\nthere not rather a contradiction in him? Let me further ask, whether he\\nis more likely to control sorrow when he is alone or when he is in\\ncompany. ‘In the latter case.’ Feeling would lead him to indulge his\\nsorrow, but reason and law control him and enjoin patience; since he\\ncannot know whether his affliction is good or evil, and no human thing\\nis of any great consequence, while sorrow is certainly a hindrance to\\ngood counsel. For when we stumble, we should not, like children, make\\nan uproar; we should take the measures which reason prescribes, not\\nraising a lament, but finding a cure. And the better part of us is\\nready to follow reason, while the irrational principle is full of\\nsorrow and distraction at the recollection of our troubles.\\nUnfortunately, however, this latter furnishes the chief materials of\\nthe imitative arts. Whereas reason is ever in repose and cannot easily\\nbe displayed, especially to a mixed multitude who have no experience of\\nher. Thus the poet is like the painter in two ways: first he paints an\\ninferior degree of truth, and secondly, he is concerned with an\\ninferior part of the soul. He indulges the feelings, while he enfeebles\\nthe reason; and we refuse to allow him to have authority over the mind\\nof man; for he has no measure of greater and less, and is a maker of\\nimages and very far gone from truth.\\n\\nBut we have not yet mentioned the heaviest count in the indictment—the\\npower which poetry has of injuriously exciting the feelings. When we\\nhear some passage in which a hero laments his sufferings at tedious\\nlength, you know that we sympathize with him and praise the poet; and\\nyet in our own sorrows such an exhibition of feeling is regarded as\\neffeminate and unmanly (Ion). Now, ought a man to feel pleasure in\\nseeing another do what he hates and abominates in himself? Is he not\\ngiving way to a sentiment which in his own case he would control?—he is\\noff his guard because the sorrow is another’s; and he thinks that he\\nmay indulge his feelings without disgrace, and will be the gainer by\\nthe pleasure. But the inevitable consequence is that he who begins by\\nweeping at the sorrows of others, will end by weeping at his own. The\\nsame is true of comedy,—you may often laugh at buffoonery which you\\nwould be ashamed to utter, and the love of coarse merriment on the\\nstage will at last turn you into a buffoon at home. Poetry feeds and\\nwaters the passions and desires; she lets them rule instead of ruling\\nthem. And therefore, when we hear the encomiasts of Homer affirming\\nthat he is the educator of Hellas, and that all life should be\\nregulated by his precepts, we may allow the excellence of their\\nintentions, and agree with them in thinking Homer a great poet and\\ntragedian. But we shall continue to prohibit all poetry which goes\\nbeyond hymns to the Gods and praises of famous men. Not pleasure and\\npain, but law and reason shall rule in our State.\\n\\nThese are our grounds for expelling poetry; but lest she should charge\\nus with discourtesy, let us also make an apology to her. We will remind\\nher that there is an ancient quarrel between poetry and philosophy, of\\nwhich there are many traces in the writings of the poets, such as the\\nsaying of ‘the she-dog, yelping at her mistress,’ and ‘the philosophers\\nwho are ready to circumvent Zeus,’ and ‘the philosophers who are\\npaupers.’ Nevertheless we bear her no ill-will, and will gladly allow\\nher to return upon condition that she makes a defence of herself in\\nverse; and her supporters who are not poets may speak in prose. We\\nconfess her charms; but if she cannot show that she is useful as well\\nas delightful, like rational lovers, we must renounce our love, though\\nendeared to us by early associations. Having come to years of\\ndiscretion, we know that poetry is not truth, and that a man should be\\ncareful how he introduces her to that state or constitution which he\\nhimself is; for there is a mighty issue at stake—no less than the good\\nor evil of a human soul. And it is not worth while to forsake justice\\nand virtue for the attractions of poetry, any more than for the sake of\\nhonour or wealth. ‘I agree with you.’\\n\\nAnd yet the rewards of virtue are greater far than I have described.\\n‘And can we conceive things greater still?’ Not, perhaps, in this brief\\nspan of life: but should an immortal being care about anything short of\\neternity? ‘I do not understand what you mean?’ Do you not know that the\\nsoul is immortal? ‘Surely you are not prepared to prove that?’ Indeed I\\nam. ‘Then let me hear this argument, of which you make so light.’\\n\\nYou would admit that everything has an element of good and of evil. In\\nall things there is an inherent corruption; and if this cannot destroy\\nthem, nothing else will. The soul too has her own corrupting\\nprinciples, which are injustice, intemperance, cowardice, and the like.\\nBut none of these destroy the soul in the same sense that disease\\ndestroys the body. The soul may be full of all iniquities, but is not,\\nby reason of them, brought any nearer to death. Nothing which was not\\ndestroyed from within ever perished by external affection of evil. The\\nbody, which is one thing, cannot be destroyed by food, which is\\nanother, unless the badness of the food is communicated to the body.\\nNeither can the soul, which is one thing, be corrupted by the body,\\nwhich is another, unless she herself is infected. And as no bodily evil\\ncan infect the soul, neither can any bodily evil, whether disease or\\nviolence, or any other destroy the soul, unless it can be shown to\\nrender her unholy and unjust. But no one will ever prove that the souls\\nof men become more unjust when they die. If a person has the audacity\\nto say the contrary, the answer is—Then why do criminals require the\\nhand of the executioner, and not die of themselves? ‘Truly,’ he said,\\n‘injustice would not be very terrible if it brought a cessation of\\nevil; but I rather believe that the injustice which murders others may\\ntend to quicken and stimulate the life of the unjust.’ You are quite\\nright. If sin which is her own natural and inherent evil cannot destroy\\nthe soul, hardly will anything else destroy her. But the soul which\\ncannot be destroyed either by internal or external evil must be\\nimmortal and everlasting. And if this be true, souls will always exist\\nin the same number. They cannot diminish, because they cannot be\\ndestroyed; nor yet increase, for the increase of the immortal must come\\nfrom something mortal, and so all would end in immortality. Neither is\\nthe soul variable and diverse; for that which is immortal must be of\\nthe fairest and simplest composition. If we would conceive her truly,\\nand so behold justice and injustice in their own nature, she must be\\nviewed by the light of reason pure as at birth, or as she is reflected\\nin philosophy when holding converse with the divine and immortal and\\neternal. In her present condition we see her only like the sea-god\\nGlaucus, bruised and maimed in the sea which is the world, and covered\\nwith shells and stones which are incrusted upon her from the\\nentertainments of earth.\\n\\nThus far, as the argument required, we have said nothing of the rewards\\nand honours which the poets attribute to justice; we have contented\\nourselves with showing that justice in herself is best for the soul in\\nherself, even if a man should put on a Gyges’ ring and have the helmet\\nof Hades too. And now you shall repay me what you borrowed; and I will\\nenumerate the rewards of justice in life and after death. I granted,\\nfor the sake of argument, as you will remember, that evil might perhaps\\nescape the knowledge of Gods and men, although this was really\\nimpossible. And since I have shown that justice has reality, you must\\ngrant me also that she has the palm of appearance. In the first place,\\nthe just man is known to the Gods, and he is therefore the friend of\\nthe Gods, and he will receive at their hands every good, always\\nexcepting such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins. All\\nthings end in good to him, either in life or after death, even what\\nappears to be evil; for the Gods have a care of him who desires to be\\nin their likeness. And what shall we say of men? Is not honesty the\\nbest policy? The clever rogue makes a great start at first, but breaks\\ndown before he reaches the goal, and slinks away in dishonour; whereas\\nthe true runner perseveres to the end, and receives the prize. And you\\nmust allow me to repeat all the blessings which you attributed to the\\nfortunate unjust—they bear rule in the city, they marry and give in\\nmarriage to whom they will; and the evils which you attributed to the\\nunfortunate just, do really fall in the end on the unjust, although, as\\nyou implied, their sufferings are better veiled in silence.\\n\\nBut all the blessings of this present life are as nothing when compared\\nwith those which await good men after death. ‘I should like to hear\\nabout them.’ Come, then, and I will tell you the story of Er, the son\\nof Armenius, a valiant man. He was supposed to have died in battle, but\\nten days afterwards his body was found untouched by corruption and sent\\nhome for burial. On the twelfth day he was placed on the funeral pyre\\nand there he came to life again, and told what he had seen in the world\\nbelow. He said that his soul went with a great company to a place, in\\nwhich there were two chasms near together in the earth beneath, and two\\ncorresponding chasms in the heaven above. And there were judges sitting\\nin the intermediate space, bidding the just ascend by the heavenly way\\non the right hand, having the seal of their judgment set upon them\\nbefore, while the unjust, having the seal behind, were bidden to\\ndescend by the way on the left hand. Him they told to look and listen,\\nas he was to be their messenger to men from the world below. And he\\nbeheld and saw the souls departing after judgment at either chasm; some\\nwho came from earth, were worn and travel-stained; others, who came\\nfrom heaven, were clean and bright. They seemed glad to meet and rest\\nawhile in the meadow; here they discoursed with one another of what\\nthey had seen in the other world. Those who came from earth wept at the\\nremembrance of their sorrows, but the spirits from above spoke of\\nglorious sights and heavenly bliss. He said that for every evil deed\\nthey were punished tenfold—now the journey was of a thousand years’\\nduration, because the life of man was reckoned as a hundred years—and\\nthe rewards of virtue were in the same proportion. He added something\\nhardly worth repeating about infants dying almost as soon as they were\\nborn. Of parricides and other murderers he had tortures still more\\nterrible to narrate. He was present when one of the spirits asked—Where\\nis Ardiaeus the Great? (This Ardiaeus was a cruel tyrant, who had\\nmurdered his father, and his elder brother, a thousand years before.)\\nAnother spirit answered, ‘He comes not hither, and will never come. And\\nI myself,’ he added, ‘actually saw this terrible sight. At the entrance\\nof the chasm, as we were about to reascend, Ardiaeus appeared, and some\\nother sinners—most of whom had been tyrants, but not all—and just as\\nthey fancied that they were returning to life, the chasm gave a roar,\\nand then wild, fiery-looking men who knew the meaning of the sound,\\nseized him and several others, and bound them hand and foot and threw\\nthem down, and dragged them along at the side of the road, lacerating\\nthem and carding them like wool, and explaining to the passers-by, that\\nthey were going to be cast into hell.’ The greatest terror of the\\npilgrims ascending was lest they should hear the voice, and when there\\nwas silence one by one they passed up with joy. To these sufferings\\nthere were corresponding delights.\\n\\nOn the eighth day the souls of the pilgrims resumed their journey, and\\nin four days came to a spot whence they looked down upon a line of\\nlight, in colour like a rainbow, only brighter and clearer. One day\\nmore brought them to the place, and they saw that this was the column\\nof light which binds together the whole universe. The ends of the\\ncolumn were fastened to heaven, and from them hung the distaff of\\nNecessity, on which all the heavenly bodies turned—the hook and spindle\\nwere of adamant, and the whorl of a mixed substance. The whorl was in\\nform like a number of boxes fitting into one another with their edges\\nturned upwards, making together a single whorl which was pierced by the\\nspindle. The outermost had the rim broadest, and the inner whorls were\\nsmaller and smaller, and had their rims narrower. The largest (the\\nfixed stars) was spangled—the seventh (the sun) was brightest—the\\neighth (the moon) shone by the light of the seventh—the second and\\nfifth (Saturn and Mercury) were most like one another and yellower than\\nthe eighth—the third (Jupiter) had the whitest light—the fourth (Mars)\\nwas red—the sixth (Venus) was in whiteness second. The whole had one\\nmotion, but while this was revolving in one direction the seven inner\\ncircles were moving in the opposite, with various degrees of swiftness\\nand slowness. The spindle turned on the knees of Necessity, and a Siren\\nstood hymning upon each circle, while Lachesis, Clotho, and Atropos,\\nthe daughters of Necessity, sat on thrones at equal intervals, singing\\nof past, present, and future, responsive to the music of the Sirens;\\nClotho from time to time guiding the outer circle with a touch of her\\nright hand; Atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner\\ncircles; Lachesis in turn putting forth her hand from time to time to\\nguide both of them. On their arrival the pilgrims went to Lachesis, and\\nthere was an interpreter who arranged them, and taking from her knees\\nlots, and samples of lives, got up into a pulpit and said: ‘Mortal\\nsouls, hear the words of Lachesis, the daughter of Necessity. A new\\nperiod of mortal life has begun, and you may choose what divinity you\\nplease; the responsibility of choosing is with you—God is blameless.’\\nAfter speaking thus, he cast the lots among them and each one took up\\nthe lot which fell near him. He then placed on the ground before them\\nthe samples of lives, many more than the souls present; and there were\\nall sorts of lives, of men and of animals. There were tyrannies ending\\nin misery and exile, and lives of men and women famous for their\\ndifferent qualities; and also mixed lives, made up of wealth and\\npoverty, sickness and health. Here, Glaucon, is the great risk of human\\nlife, and therefore the whole of education should be directed to the\\nacquisition of such a knowledge as will teach a man to refuse the evil\\nand choose the good. He should know all the combinations which occur in\\nlife—of beauty with poverty or with wealth,—of knowledge with external\\ngoods,—and at last choose with reference to the nature of the soul,\\nregarding that only as the better life which makes men better, and\\nleaving the rest. And a man must take with him an iron sense of truth\\nand right into the world below, that there too he may remain undazzled\\nby wealth or the allurements of evil, and be determined to avoid the\\nextremes and choose the mean. For this, as the messenger reported the\\ninterpreter to have said, is the true happiness of man; and any one, as\\nhe proclaimed, may, if he choose with understanding, have a good lot,\\neven though he come last. ‘Let not the first be careless in his choice,\\nnor the last despair.’ He spoke; and when he had spoken, he who had\\ndrawn the first lot chose a tyranny: he did not see that he was fated\\nto devour his own children—and when he discovered his mistake, he wept\\nand beat his breast, blaming chance and the Gods and anybody rather\\nthan himself. He was one of those who had come from heaven, and in his\\nprevious life had been a citizen of a well-ordered State, but he had\\nonly habit and no philosophy. Like many another, he made a bad choice,\\nbecause he had no experience of life; whereas those who came from earth\\nand had seen trouble were not in such a hurry to choose. But if a man\\nhad followed philosophy while upon earth, and had been moderately\\nfortunate in his lot, he might not only be happy here, but his\\npilgrimage both from and to this world would be smooth and heavenly.\\nNothing was more curious than the spectacle of the choice, at once sad\\nand laughable and wonderful; most of the souls only seeking to avoid\\ntheir own condition in a previous life. He saw the soul of Orpheus\\nchanging into a swan because he would not be born of a woman; there was\\nThamyras becoming a nightingale; musical birds, like the swan, choosing\\nto be men; the twentieth soul, which was that of Ajax, preferring the\\nlife of a lion to that of a man, in remembrance of the injustice which\\nwas done to him in the judgment of the arms; and Agamemnon, from a like\\nenmity to human nature, passing into an eagle. About the middle was the\\nsoul of Atalanta choosing the honours of an athlete, and next to her\\nEpeus taking the nature of a workwoman; among the last was Thersites,\\nwho was changing himself into a monkey. Thither, the last of all, came\\nOdysseus, and sought the lot of a private man, which lay neglected and\\ndespised, and when he found it he went away rejoicing, and said that if\\nhe had been first instead of last, his choice would have been the same.\\nMen, too, were seen passing into animals, and wild and tame animals\\nchanging into one another.\\n\\nWhen all the souls had chosen they went to Lachesis, who sent with each\\nof them their genius or attendant to fulfil their lot. He first of all\\nbrought them under the hand of Clotho, and drew them within the\\nrevolution of the spindle impelled by her hand; from her they were\\ncarried to Atropos, who made the threads irreversible; whence, without\\nturning round, they passed beneath the throne of Necessity; and when\\nthey had all passed, they moved on in scorching heat to the plain of\\nForgetfulness and rested at evening by the river Unmindful, whose water\\ncould not be retained in any vessel; of this they had all to drink a\\ncertain quantity—some of them drank more than was required, and he who\\ndrank forgot all things. Er himself was prevented from drinking. When\\nthey had gone to rest, about the middle of the night there were\\nthunderstorms and earthquakes, and suddenly they were all driven divers\\nways, shooting like stars to their birth. Concerning his return to the\\nbody, he only knew that awaking suddenly in the morning he found\\nhimself lying on the pyre.\\n\\nThus, Glaucon, the tale has been saved, and will be our salvation, if\\nwe believe that the soul is immortal, and hold fast to the heavenly way\\nof Justice and Knowledge. So shall we pass undefiled over the river of\\nForgetfulness, and be dear to ourselves and to the Gods, and have a\\ncrown of reward and happiness both in this world and also in the\\nmillennial pilgrimage of the other.\\n\\nThe Tenth Book of the Republic of Plato falls into two divisions:\\nfirst, resuming an old thread which has been interrupted, Socrates\\nassails the poets, who, now that the nature of the soul has been\\nanalyzed, are seen to be very far gone from the truth; and secondly,\\nhaving shown the reality of the happiness of the just, he demands that\\nappearance shall be restored to him, and then proceeds to prove the\\nimmortality of the soul. The argument, as in the Phaedo and Gorgias, is\\nsupplemented by the vision of a future life.\\n\\nWhy Plato, who was himself a poet, and whose dialogues are poems and\\ndramas, should have been hostile to the poets as a class, and\\nespecially to the dramatic poets; why he should not have seen that\\ntruth may be embodied in verse as well as in prose, and that there are\\nsome indefinable lights and shadows of human life which can only be\\nexpressed in poetry—some elements of imagination which always entwine\\nwith reason; why he should have supposed epic verse to be inseparably\\nassociated with the impurities of the old Hellenic mythology; why he\\nshould try Homer and Hesiod by the unfair and prosaic test of\\nutility,—are questions which have always been debated amongst students\\nof Plato. Though unable to give a complete answer to them, we may\\nshow—first, that his views arose naturally out of the circumstances of\\nhis age; and secondly, we may elicit the truth as well as the error\\nwhich is contained in them.\\n\\nHe is the enemy of the poets because poetry was declining in his own\\nlifetime, and a theatrocracy, as he says in the Laws, had taken the\\nplace of an intellectual aristocracy. Euripides exhibited the last\\nphase of the tragic drama, and in him Plato saw the friend and\\napologist of tyrants, and the Sophist of tragedy. The old comedy was\\nalmost extinct; the new had not yet arisen. Dramatic and lyric poetry,\\nlike every other branch of Greek literature, was falling under the\\npower of rhetoric. There was no ‘second or third’ to Aeschylus and\\nSophocles in the generation which followed them. Aristophanes, in one\\nof his later comedies (Frogs), speaks of ‘thousands of tragedy-making\\nprattlers,’ whose attempts at poetry he compares to the chirping of\\nswallows; ‘their garrulity went far beyond Euripides,’—‘they appeared\\nonce upon the stage, and there was an end of them.’ To a man of genius\\nwho had a real appreciation of the godlike Aeschylus and the noble and\\ngentle Sophocles, though disagreeing with some parts of their\\n‘theology’ (Rep.), these ‘minor poets’ must have been contemptible and\\nintolerable. There is no feeling stronger in the dialogues of Plato\\nthan a sense of the decline and decay both in literature and in\\npolitics which marked his own age. Nor can he have been expected to\\nlook with favour on the licence of Aristophanes, now at the end of his\\ncareer, who had begun by satirizing Socrates in the Clouds, and in a\\nsimilar spirit forty years afterwards had satirized the founders of\\nideal commonwealths in his Eccleziazusae, or Female Parliament (Laws).\\n\\nThere were other reasons for the antagonism of Plato to poetry. The\\nprofession of an actor was regarded by him as a degradation of human\\nnature, for ‘one man in his life’ cannot ‘play many parts;’ the\\ncharacters which the actor performs seem to destroy his own character,\\nand to leave nothing which can be truly called himself. Neither can any\\nman live his life and act it. The actor is the slave of his art, not\\nthe master of it. Taking this view Plato is more decided in his\\nexpulsion of the dramatic than of the epic poets, though he must have\\nknown that the Greek tragedians afforded noble lessons and examples of\\nvirtue and patriotism, to which nothing in Homer can be compared. But\\ngreat dramatic or even great rhetorical power is hardly consistent with\\nfirmness or strength of mind, and dramatic talent is often incidentally\\nassociated with a weak or dissolute character.\\n\\nIn the Tenth Book Plato introduces a new series of objections. First,\\nhe says that the poet or painter is an imitator, and in the third\\ndegree removed from the truth. His creations are not tested by rule and\\nmeasure; they are only appearances. In modern times we should say that\\nart is not merely imitation, but rather the expression of the ideal in\\nforms of sense. Even adopting the humble image of Plato, from which his\\nargument derives a colour, we should maintain that the artist may\\nennoble the bed which he paints by the folds of the drapery, or by the\\nfeeling of home which he introduces; and there have been modern\\npainters who have imparted such an ideal interest to a blacksmith’s or\\na carpenter’s shop. The eye or mind which feels as well as sees can\\ngive dignity and pathos to a ruined mill, or a straw-built shed\\n(Rembrandt), to the hull of a vessel ‘going to its last home’ (Turner).\\nStill more would this apply to the greatest works of art, which seem to\\nbe the visible embodiment of the divine. Had Plato been asked whether\\nthe Zeus or Athene of Pheidias was the imitation of an imitation only,\\nwould he not have been compelled to admit that something more was to be\\nfound in them than in the form of any mortal; and that the rule of\\nproportion to which they conformed was ‘higher far than any geometry or\\narithmetic could express?’ (Statesman.)\\n\\nAgain, Plato objects to the imitative arts that they express the\\nemotional rather than the rational part of human nature. He does not\\nadmit Aristotle’s theory, that tragedy or other serious imitations are\\na purgation of the passions by pity and fear; to him they appear only\\nto afford the opportunity of indulging them. Yet we must acknowledge\\nthat we may sometimes cure disordered emotions by giving expression to\\nthem; and that they often gain strength when pent up within our own\\nbreast. It is not every indulgence of the feelings which is to be\\ncondemned. For there may be a gratification of the higher as well as of\\nthe lower—thoughts which are too deep or too sad to be expressed by\\nourselves, may find an utterance in the words of poets. Every one would\\nacknowledge that there have been times when they were consoled and\\nelevated by beautiful music or by the sublimity of architecture or by\\nthe peacefulness of nature. Plato has himself admitted, in the earlier\\npart of the Republic, that the arts might have the effect of\\nharmonizing as well as of enervating the mind; but in the Tenth Book he\\nregards them through a Stoic or Puritan medium. He asks only ‘What good\\nhave they done?’ and is not satisfied with the reply, that ‘They have\\ngiven innocent pleasure to mankind.’\\n\\nHe tells us that he rejoices in the banishment of the poets, since he\\nhas found by the analysis of the soul that they are concerned with the\\ninferior faculties. He means to say that the higher faculties have to\\ndo with universals, the lower with particulars of sense. The poets are\\non a level with their own age, but not on a level with Socrates and\\nPlato; and he was well aware that Homer and Hesiod could not be made a\\nrule of life by any process of legitimate interpretation; his ironical\\nuse of them is in fact a denial of their authority; he saw, too, that\\nthe poets were not critics—as he says in the Apology, ‘Any one was a\\nbetter interpreter of their writings than they were themselves. He\\nhimself ceased to be a poet when he became a disciple of Socrates;\\nthough, as he tells us of Solon, ‘he might have been one of the\\ngreatest of them, if he had not been deterred by other pursuits’ (Tim.)\\nThus from many points of view there is an antagonism between Plato and\\nthe poets, which was foreshadowed to him in the old quarrel between\\nphilosophy and poetry. The poets, as he says in the Protagoras, were\\nthe Sophists of their day; and his dislike of the one class is\\nreflected on the other. He regards them both as the enemies of\\nreasoning and abstraction, though in the case of Euripides more with\\nreference to his immoral sentiments about tyrants and the like. For\\nPlato is the prophet who ‘came into the world to convince men’—first of\\nthe fallibility of sense and opinion, and secondly of the reality of\\nabstract ideas. Whatever strangeness there may be in modern times in\\nopposing philosophy to poetry, which to us seem to have so many\\nelements in common, the strangeness will disappear if we conceive of\\npoetry as allied to sense, and of philosophy as equivalent to thought\\nand abstraction. Unfortunately the very word ‘idea,’ which to Plato is\\nexpressive of the most real of all things, is associated in our minds\\nwith an element of subjectiveness and unreality. We may note also how\\nhe differs from Aristotle who declares poetry to be truer than history,\\nfor the opposite reason, because it is concerned with universals, not\\nlike history, with particulars (Poet).\\n\\nThe things which are seen are opposed in Scripture to the things which\\nare unseen—they are equally opposed in Plato to universals and ideas.\\nTo him all particulars appear to be floating about in a world of sense;\\nthey have a taint of error or even of evil. There is no difficulty in\\nseeing that this is an illusion; for there is no more error or\\nvariation in an individual man, horse, bed, etc., than in the class\\nman, horse, bed, etc.; nor is the truth which is displayed in\\nindividual instances less certain than that which is conveyed through\\nthe medium of ideas. But Plato, who is deeply impressed with the real\\nimportance of universals as instruments of thought, attributes to them\\nan essential truth which is imaginary and unreal; for universals may be\\noften false and particulars true. Had he attained to any clear\\nconception of the individual, which is the synthesis of the universal\\nand the particular; or had he been able to distinguish between opinion\\nand sensation, which the ambiguity of the words (Greek) and the like,\\ntended to confuse, he would not have denied truth to the particulars of\\nsense.\\n\\nBut the poets are also the representatives of falsehood and feigning in\\nall departments of life and knowledge, like the sophists and\\nrhetoricians of the Gorgias and Phaedrus; they are the false priests,\\nfalse prophets, lying spirits, enchanters of the world. There is\\nanother count put into the indictment against them by Plato, that they\\nare the friends of the tyrant, and bask in the sunshine of his\\npatronage. Despotism in all ages has had an apparatus of false ideas\\nand false teachers at its service—in the history of Modern Europe as\\nwell as of Greece and Rome. For no government of men depends solely\\nupon force; without some corruption of literature and morals—some\\nappeal to the imagination of the masses—some pretence to the favour of\\nheaven—some element of good giving power to evil, tyranny, even for a\\nshort time, cannot be maintained. The Greek tyrants were not insensible\\nto the importance of awakening in their cause a Pseudo-Hellenic\\nfeeling; they were proud of successes at the Olympic games; they were\\nnot devoid of the love of literature and art. Plato is thinking in the\\nfirst instance of Greek poets who had graced the courts of Dionysius or\\nArchelaus: and the old spirit of freedom is roused within him at their\\nprostitution of the Tragic Muse in the praises of tyranny. But his\\nprophetic eye extends beyond them to the false teachers of other ages\\nwho are the creatures of the government under which they live. He\\ncompares the corruption of his contemporaries with the idea of a\\nperfect society, and gathers up into one mass of evil the evils and\\nerrors of mankind; to him they are personified in the rhetoricians,\\nsophists, poets, rulers who deceive and govern the world.\\n\\nA further objection which Plato makes to poetry and the imitative arts\\nis that they excite the emotions. Here the modern reader will be\\ndisposed to introduce a distinction which appears to have escaped him.\\nFor the emotions are neither bad nor good in themselves, and are not\\nmost likely to be controlled by the attempt to eradicate them, but by\\nthe moderate indulgence of them. And the vocation of art is to present\\nthought in the form of feeling, to enlist the feelings on the side of\\nreason, to inspire even for a moment courage or resignation; perhaps to\\nsuggest a sense of infinity and eternity in a way which mere language\\nis incapable of attaining. True, the same power which in the purer age\\nof art embodies gods and heroes only, may be made to express the\\nvoluptuous image of a Corinthian courtezan. But this only shows that\\nart, like other outward things, may be turned to good and also to evil,\\nand is not more closely connected with the higher than with the lower\\npart of the soul. All imitative art is subject to certain limitations,\\nand therefore necessarily partakes of the nature of a compromise.\\nSomething of ideal truth is sacrificed for the sake of the\\nrepresentation, and something in the exactness of the representation is\\nsacrificed to the ideal. Still, works of art have a permanent element;\\nthey idealize and detain the passing thought, and are the intermediates\\nbetween sense and ideas.\\n\\nIn the present stage of the human mind, poetry and other forms of\\nfiction may certainly be regarded as a good. But we can also imagine\\nthe existence of an age in which a severer conception of truth has\\neither banished or transformed them. At any rate we must admit that\\nthey hold a different place at different periods of the world’s\\nhistory. In the infancy of mankind, poetry, with the exception of\\nproverbs, is the whole of literature, and the only instrument of\\nintellectual culture; in modern times she is the shadow or echo of her\\nformer self, and appears to have a precarious existence. Milton in his\\nday doubted whether an epic poem was any longer possible. At the same\\ntime we must remember, that what Plato would have called the charms of\\npoetry have been partly transferred to prose; he himself (Statesman)\\nadmits rhetoric to be the handmaiden of Politics, and proposes to find\\nin the strain of law (Laws) a substitute for the old poets. Among\\nourselves the creative power seems often to be growing weaker, and\\nscientific fact to be more engrossing and overpowering to the mind than\\nformerly. The illusion of the feelings commonly called love, has\\nhitherto been the inspiring influence of modern poetry and romance, and\\nhas exercised a humanizing if not a strengthening influence on the\\nworld. But may not the stimulus which love has given to fancy be some\\nday exhausted? The modern English novel which is the most popular of\\nall forms of reading is not more than a century or two old: will the\\ntale of love a hundred years hence, after so many thousand variations\\nof the same theme, be still received with unabated interest?\\n\\nArt cannot claim to be on a level with philosophy or religion, and may\\noften corrupt them. It is possible to conceive a mental state in which\\nall artistic representations are regarded as a false and imperfect\\nexpression, either of the religious ideal or of the philosophical\\nideal. The fairest forms may be revolting in certain moods of mind, as\\nis proved by the fact that the Mahometans, and many sects of\\nChristians, have renounced the use of pictures and images. The\\nbeginning of a great religion, whether Christian or Gentile, has not\\nbeen ‘wood or stone,’ but a spirit moving in the hearts of men. The\\ndisciples have met in a large upper room or in ‘holes and caves of the\\nearth’; in the second or third generation, they have had mosques,\\ntemples, churches, monasteries. And the revival or reform of religions,\\nlike the first revelation of them, has come from within and has\\ngenerally disregarded external ceremonies and accompaniments.\\n\\nBut poetry and art may also be the expression of the highest truth and\\nthe purest sentiment. Plato himself seems to waver between two opposite\\nviews—when, as in the third Book, he insists that youth should be\\nbrought up amid wholesome imagery; and again in Book X, when he\\nbanishes the poets from his Republic. Admitting that the arts, which\\nsome of us almost deify, have fallen short of their higher aim, we must\\nadmit on the other hand that to banish imagination wholly would be\\nsuicidal as well as impossible. For nature too is a form of art; and a\\nbreath of the fresh air or a single glance at the varying landscape\\nwould in an instant revive and reillumine the extinguished spark of\\npoetry in the human breast. In the lower stages of civilization\\nimagination more than reason distinguishes man from the animals; and to\\nbanish art would be to banish thought, to banish language, to banish\\nthe expression of all truth. No religion is wholly devoid of external\\nforms; even the Mahometan who renounces the use of pictures and images\\nhas a temple in which he worships the Most High, as solemn and\\nbeautiful as any Greek or Christian building. Feeling too and thought\\nare not really opposed; for he who thinks must feel before he can\\nexecute. And the highest thoughts, when they become familiarized to us,\\nare always tending to pass into the form of feeling.\\n\\nPlato does not seriously intend to expel poets from life and society.\\nBut he feels strongly the unreality of their writings; he is protesting\\nagainst the degeneracy of poetry in his own day as we might protest\\nagainst the want of serious purpose in modern fiction, against the\\nunseemliness or extravagance of some of our poets or novelists, against\\nthe time-serving of preachers or public writers, against the\\nregardlessness of truth which to the eye of the philosopher seems to\\ncharacterize the greater part of the world. For we too have reason to\\ncomplain that our poets and novelists ‘paint inferior truth’ and ‘are\\nconcerned with the inferior part of the soul’; that the readers of them\\nbecome what they read and are injuriously affected by them. And we look\\nin vain for that healthy atmosphere of which Plato speaks,—‘the beauty\\nwhich meets the sense like a breeze and imperceptibly draws the soul,\\neven in childhood, into harmony with the beauty of reason.’\\n\\nFor there might be a poetry which would be the hymn of divine\\nperfection, the harmony of goodness and truth among men: a strain which\\nshould renew the youth of the world, and bring back the ages in which\\nthe poet was man’s only teacher and best friend,—which would find\\nmaterials in the living present as well as in the romance of the past,\\nand might subdue to the fairest forms of speech and verse the\\nintractable materials of modern civilisation,—which might elicit the\\nsimple principles, or, as Plato would have called them, the essential\\nforms, of truth and justice out of the variety of opinion and the\\ncomplexity of modern society,—which would preserve all the good of each\\ngeneration and leave the bad unsung,—which should be based not on vain\\nlongings or faint imaginings, but on a clear insight into the nature of\\nman. Then the tale of love might begin again in poetry or prose, two in\\none, united in the pursuit of knowledge, or the service of God and man;\\nand feelings of love might still be the incentive to great thoughts and\\nheroic deeds as in the days of Dante or Petrarch; and many types of\\nmanly and womanly beauty might appear among us, rising above the\\nordinary level of humanity, and many lives which were like poems\\n(Laws), be not only written, but lived by us. A few such strains have\\nbeen heard among men in the tragedies of Aeschylus and Sophocles, whom\\nPlato quotes, not, as Homer is quoted by him, in irony, but with deep\\nand serious approval,—in the poetry of Milton and Wordsworth, and in\\npassages of other English poets,—first and above all in the Hebrew\\nprophets and psalmists. Shakespeare has taught us how great men should\\nspeak and act; he has drawn characters of a wonderful purity and depth;\\nhe has ennobled the human mind, but, like Homer (Rep.), he ‘has left no\\nway of life.’ The next greatest poet of modern times, Goethe, is\\nconcerned with ‘a lower degree of truth’; he paints the world as a\\nstage on which ‘all the men and women are merely players’; he\\ncultivates life as an art, but he furnishes no ideals of truth and\\naction. The poet may rebel against any attempt to set limits to his\\nfancy; and he may argue truly that moralizing in verse is not poetry.\\nPossibly, like Mephistopheles in Faust, he may retaliate on his\\nadversaries. But the philosopher will still be justified in asking,\\n‘How may the heavenly gift of poesy be devoted to the good of mankind?’\\n\\nReturning to Plato, we may observe that a similar mixture of truth and\\nerror appears in other parts of the argument. He is aware of the\\nabsurdity of mankind framing their whole lives according to Homer; just\\nas in the Phaedrus he intimates the absurdity of interpreting mythology\\nupon rational principles; both these were the modern tendencies of his\\nown age, which he deservedly ridicules. On the other hand, his argument\\nthat Homer, if he had been able to teach mankind anything worth\\nknowing, would not have been allowed by them to go about begging as a\\nrhapsodist, is both false and contrary to the spirit of Plato (Rep.).\\nIt may be compared with those other paradoxes of the Gorgias, that ‘No\\nstatesman was ever unjustly put to death by the city of which he was\\nthe head’; and that ‘No Sophist was ever defrauded by his pupils’\\n(Gorg.)...\\n\\nThe argument for immortality seems to rest on the absolute dualism of\\nsoul and body. Admitting the existence of the soul, we know of no force\\nwhich is able to put an end to her. Vice is her own proper evil; and if\\nshe cannot be destroyed by that, she cannot be destroyed by any other.\\nYet Plato has acknowledged that the soul may be so overgrown by the\\nincrustations of earth as to lose her original form; and in the Timaeus\\nhe recognizes more strongly than in the Republic the influence which\\nthe body has over the mind, denying even the voluntariness of human\\nactions, on the ground that they proceed from physical states (Tim.).\\nIn the Republic, as elsewhere, he wavers between the original soul\\nwhich has to be restored, and the character which is developed by\\ntraining and education...\\n\\nThe vision of another world is ascribed to Er, the son of Armenius, who\\nis said by Clement of Alexandria to have been Zoroaster. The tale has\\ncertainly an oriental character, and may be compared with the\\npilgrimages of the soul in the Zend Avesta (Haug, Avesta). But no trace\\nof acquaintance with Zoroaster is found elsewhere in Plato’s writings,\\nand there is no reason for giving him the name of Er the Pamphylian.\\nThe philosophy of Heracleitus cannot be shown to be borrowed from\\nZoroaster, and still less the myths of Plato.\\n\\nThe local arrangement of the vision is less distinct than that of the\\nPhaedrus and Phaedo. Astronomy is mingled with symbolism and mythology;\\nthe great sphere of heaven is represented under the symbol of a\\ncylinder or box, containing the seven orbits of the planets and the\\nfixed stars; this is suspended from an axis or spindle which turns on\\nthe knees of Necessity; the revolutions of the seven orbits contained\\nin the cylinder are guided by the fates, and their harmonious motion\\nproduces the music of the spheres. Through the innermost or eighth of\\nthese, which is the moon, is passed the spindle; but it is doubtful\\nwhether this is the continuation of the column of light, from which the\\npilgrims contemplate the heavens; the words of Plato imply that they\\nare connected, but not the same. The column itself is clearly not of\\nadamant. The spindle (which is of adamant) is fastened to the ends of\\nthe chains which extend to the middle of the column of light—this\\ncolumn is said to hold together the heaven; but whether it hangs from\\nthe spindle, or is at right angles to it, is not explained. The\\ncylinder containing the orbits of the stars is almost as much a symbol\\nas the figure of Necessity turning the spindle;—for the outermost rim\\nis the sphere of the fixed stars, and nothing is said about the\\nintervals of space which divide the paths of the stars in the heavens.\\nThe description is both a picture and an orrery, and therefore is\\nnecessarily inconsistent with itself. The column of light is not the\\nMilky Way—which is neither straight, nor like a rainbow—but the\\nimaginary axis of the earth. This is compared to the rainbow in respect\\nnot of form but of colour, and not to the undergirders of a trireme,\\nbut to the straight rope running from prow to stern in which the\\nundergirders meet.\\n\\nThe orrery or picture of the heavens given in the Republic differs in\\nits mode of representation from the circles of the same and of the\\nother in the Timaeus. In both the fixed stars are distinguished from\\nthe planets, and they move in orbits without them, although in an\\nopposite direction: in the Republic as in the Timaeus they are all\\nmoving round the axis of the world. But we are not certain that in the\\nformer they are moving round the earth. No distinct mention is made in\\nthe Republic of the circles of the same and other; although both in the\\nTimaeus and in the Republic the motion of the fixed stars is supposed\\nto coincide with the motion of the whole. The relative thickness of the\\nrims is perhaps designed to express the relative distances of the\\nplanets. Plato probably intended to represent the earth, from which Er\\nand his companions are viewing the heavens, as stationary in place; but\\nwhether or not herself revolving, unless this is implied in the\\nrevolution of the axis, is uncertain (Timaeus). The spectator may be\\nsupposed to look at the heavenly bodies, either from above or below.\\nThe earth is a sort of earth and heaven in one, like the heaven of the\\nPhaedrus, on the back of which the spectator goes out to take a peep at\\nthe stars and is borne round in the revolution. There is no distinction\\nbetween the equator and the ecliptic. But Plato is no doubt led to\\nimagine that the planets have an opposite motion to that of the fixed\\nstars, in order to account for their appearances in the heavens. In the\\ndescription of the meadow, and the retribution of the good and evil\\nafter death, there are traces of Homer.\\n\\nThe description of the axis as a spindle, and of the heavenly bodies as\\nforming a whole, partly arises out of the attempt to connect the\\nmotions of the heavenly bodies with the mythological image of the web,\\nor weaving of the Fates. The giving of the lots, the weaving of them,\\nand the making of them irreversible, which are ascribed to the three\\nFates—Lachesis, Clotho, Atropos, are obviously derived from their\\nnames. The element of chance in human life is indicated by the order of\\nthe lots. But chance, however adverse, may be overcome by the wisdom of\\nman, if he knows how to choose aright; there is a worse enemy to man\\nthan chance; this enemy is himself. He who was moderately fortunate in\\nthe number of the lot—even the very last comer—might have a good life\\nif he chose with wisdom. And as Plato does not like to make an\\nassertion which is unproven, he more than confirms this statement a few\\nsentences afterwards by the example of Odysseus, who chose last. But\\nthe virtue which is founded on habit is not sufficient to enable a man\\nto choose; he must add to virtue knowledge, if he is to act rightly\\nwhen placed in new circumstances. The routine of good actions and good\\nhabits is an inferior sort of goodness; and, as Coleridge says, ‘Common\\nsense is intolerable which is not based on metaphysics,’ so Plato would\\nhave said, ‘Habit is worthless which is not based upon philosophy.’\\n\\nThe freedom of the will to refuse the evil and to choose the good is\\ndistinctly asserted. ‘Virtue is free, and as a man honours or\\ndishonours her he will have more or less of her.’ The life of man is\\n‘rounded’ by necessity; there are circumstances prior to birth which\\naffect him (Pol.). But within the walls of necessity there is an open\\nspace in which he is his own master, and can study for himself the\\neffects which the variously compounded gifts of nature or fortune have\\nupon the soul, and act accordingly. All men cannot have the first\\nchoice in everything. But the lot of all men is good enough, if they\\nchoose wisely and will live diligently.\\n\\nThe verisimilitude which is given to the pilgrimage of a thousand\\nyears, by the intimation that Ardiaeus had lived a thousand years\\nbefore; the coincidence of Er coming to life on the twelfth day after\\nhe was supposed to have been dead with the seven days which the\\npilgrims passed in the meadow, and the four days during which they\\njourneyed to the column of light; the precision with which the soul is\\nmentioned who chose the twentieth lot; the passing remarks that there\\nwas no definite character among the souls, and that the souls which had\\nchosen ill blamed any one rather than themselves; or that some of the\\nsouls drank more than was necessary of the waters of Forgetfulness,\\nwhile Er himself was hindered from drinking; the desire of Odysseus to\\nrest at last, unlike the conception of him in Dante and Tennyson; the\\nfeigned ignorance of how Er returned to the body, when the other souls\\nwent shooting like stars to their birth,—add greatly to the probability\\nof the narrative. They are such touches of nature as the art of Defoe\\nmight have introduced when he wished to win credibility for marvels and\\napparitions.\\n\\n\\nThere still remain to be considered some points which have been\\nintentionally reserved to the end: (1) the Janus-like character of the\\nRepublic, which presents two faces—one an Hellenic state, the other a\\nkingdom of philosophers. Connected with the latter of the two aspects\\nare (2) the paradoxes of the Republic, as they have been termed by\\nMorgenstern: (a) the community of property; (b) of families; (c) the\\nrule of philosophers; (d) the analogy of the individual and the State,\\nwhich, like some other analogies in the Republic, is carried too far.\\nWe may then proceed to consider (3) the subject of education as\\nconceived by Plato, bringing together in a general view the education\\nof youth and the education of after-life; (4) we may note further some\\nessential differences between ancient and modern politics which are\\nsuggested by the Republic; (5) we may compare the Politicus and the\\nLaws; (6) we may observe the influence exercised by Plato on his\\nimitators; and (7) take occasion to consider the nature and value of\\npolitical, and (8) of religious ideals.\\n\\n1. Plato expressly says that he is intending to found an Hellenic State\\n(Book V). Many of his regulations are characteristically Spartan; such\\nas the prohibition of gold and silver, the common meals of the men, the\\nmilitary training of the youth, the gymnastic exercises of the women.\\nThe life of Sparta was the life of a camp (Laws), enforced even more\\nrigidly in time of peace than in war; the citizens of Sparta, like\\nPlato’s, were forbidden to trade—they were to be soldiers and not\\nshopkeepers. Nowhere else in Greece was the individual so completely\\nsubjected to the State; the time when he was to marry, the education of\\nhis children, the clothes which he was to wear, the food which he was\\nto eat, were all prescribed by law. Some of the best enactments in the\\nRepublic, such as the reverence to be paid to parents and elders, and\\nsome of the worst, such as the exposure of deformed children, are\\nborrowed from the practice of Sparta. The encouragement of friendships\\nbetween men and youths, or of men with one another, as affording\\nincentives to bravery, is also Spartan; in Sparta too a nearer approach\\nwas made than in any other Greek State to equality of the sexes, and to\\ncommunity of property; and while there was probably less of\\nlicentiousness in the sense of immorality, the tie of marriage was\\nregarded more lightly than in the rest of Greece. The ‘suprema lex’ was\\nthe preservation of the family, and the interest of the State. The\\ncoarse strength of a military government was not favourable to purity\\nand refinement; and the excessive strictness of some regulations seems\\nto have produced a reaction. Of all Hellenes the Spartans were most\\naccessible to bribery; several of the greatest of them might be\\ndescribed in the words of Plato as having a ‘fierce secret longing\\nafter gold and silver.’ Though not in the strict sense communists, the\\nprinciple of communism was maintained among them in their division of\\nlands, in their common meals, in their slaves, and in the free use of\\none another’s goods. Marriage was a public institution: and the women\\nwere educated by the State, and sang and danced in public with the men.\\n\\nMany traditions were preserved at Sparta of the severity with which the\\nmagistrates had maintained the primitive rule of music and poetry; as\\nin the Republic of Plato, the new-fangled poet was to be expelled.\\nHymns to the Gods, which are the only kind of music admitted into the\\nideal State, were the only kind which was permitted at Sparta. The\\nSpartans, though an unpoetical race, were nevertheless lovers of\\npoetry; they had been stirred by the Elegiac strains of Tyrtaeus, they\\nhad crowded around Hippias to hear his recitals of Homer; but in this\\nthey resembled the citizens of the timocratic rather than of the ideal\\nState. The council of elder men also corresponds to the Spartan\\ngerousia; and the freedom with which they are permitted to judge about\\nmatters of detail agrees with what we are told of that institution.\\nOnce more, the military rule of not spoiling the dead or offering arms\\nat the temples; the moderation in the pursuit of enemies; the\\nimportance attached to the physical well-being of the citizens; the use\\nof warfare for the sake of defence rather than of aggression—are\\nfeatures probably suggested by the spirit and practice of Sparta.\\n\\nTo the Spartan type the ideal State reverts in the first decline; and\\nthe character of the individual timocrat is borrowed from the Spartan\\ncitizen. The love of Lacedaemon not only affected Plato and Xenophon,\\nbut was shared by many undistinguished Athenians; there they seemed to\\nfind a principle which was wanting in their own democracy. The (Greek)\\nof the Spartans attracted them, that is to say, not the goodness of\\ntheir laws, but the spirit of order and loyalty which prevailed.\\nFascinated by the idea, citizens of Athens would imitate the\\nLacedaemonians in their dress and manners; they were known to the\\ncontemporaries of Plato as ‘the persons who had their ears bruised,’\\nlike the Roundheads of the Commonwealth. The love of another church or\\ncountry when seen at a distance only, the longing for an imaginary\\nsimplicity in civilized times, the fond desire of a past which never\\nhas been, or of a future which never will be,—these are aspirations of\\nthe human mind which are often felt among ourselves. Such feelings meet\\nwith a response in the Republic of Plato.\\n\\nBut there are other features of the Platonic Republic, as, for example,\\nthe literary and philosophical education, and the grace and beauty of\\nlife, which are the reverse of Spartan. Plato wishes to give his\\ncitizens a taste of Athenian freedom as well as of Lacedaemonian\\ndiscipline. His individual genius is purely Athenian, although in\\ntheory he is a lover of Sparta; and he is something more than either—he\\nhas also a true Hellenic feeling. He is desirous of humanizing the wars\\nof Hellenes against one another; he acknowledges that the Delphian God\\nis the grand hereditary interpreter of all Hellas. The spirit of\\nharmony and the Dorian mode are to prevail, and the whole State is to\\nhave an external beauty which is the reflex of the harmony within. But\\nhe has not yet found out the truth which he afterwards enunciated in\\nthe Laws—that he was a better legislator who made men to be of one\\nmind, than he who trained them for war. The citizens, as in other\\nHellenic States, democratic as well as aristocratic, are really an\\nupper class; for, although no mention is made of slaves, the lower\\nclasses are allowed to fade away into the distance, and are represented\\nin the individual by the passions. Plato has no idea either of a social\\nState in which all classes are harmonized, or of a federation of Hellas\\nor the world in which different nations or States have a place. His\\ncity is equipped for war rather than for peace, and this would seem to\\nbe justified by the ordinary condition of Hellenic States. The myth of\\nthe earth-born men is an embodiment of the orthodox tradition of\\nHellas, and the allusion to the four ages of the world is also\\nsanctioned by the authority of Hesiod and the poets. Thus we see that\\nthe Republic is partly founded on the ideal of the old Greek polis,\\npartly on the actual circumstances of Hellas in that age. Plato, like\\nthe old painters, retains the traditional form, and like them he has\\nalso a vision of a city in the clouds.\\n\\nThere is yet another thread which is interwoven in the texture of the\\nwork; for the Republic is not only a Dorian State, but a Pythagorean\\nleague. The ‘way of life’ which was connected with the name of\\nPythagoras, like the Catholic monastic orders, showed the power which\\nthe mind of an individual might exercise over his contemporaries, and\\nmay have naturally suggested to Plato the possibility of reviving such\\n‘mediaeval institutions.’ The Pythagoreans, like Plato, enforced a rule\\nof life and a moral and intellectual training. The influence ascribed\\nto music, which to us seems exaggerated, is also a Pythagorean feature;\\nit is not to be regarded as representing the real influence of music in\\nthe Greek world. More nearly than any other government of Hellas, the\\nPythagorean league of three hundred was an aristocracy of virtue. For\\nonce in the history of mankind the philosophy of order or (Greek),\\nexpressing and consequently enlisting on its side the combined\\nendeavours of the better part of the people, obtained the management of\\npublic affairs and held possession of it for a considerable time (until\\nabout B.C. 500). Probably only in States prepared by Dorian\\ninstitutions would such a league have been possible. The rulers, like\\nPlato’s (Greek), were required to submit to a severe training in order\\nto prepare the way for the education of the other members of the\\ncommunity. Long after the dissolution of the Order, eminent\\nPythagoreans, such as Archytas of Tarentum, retained their political\\ninfluence over the cities of Magna Graecia. There was much here that\\nwas suggestive to the kindred spirit of Plato, who had doubtless\\nmeditated deeply on the ‘way of life of Pythagoras’ (Rep.) and his\\nfollowers. Slight traces of Pythagoreanism are to be found in the\\nmystical number of the State, in the number which expresses the\\ninterval between the king and the tyrant, in the doctrine of\\ntransmigration, in the music of the spheres, as well as in the great\\nthough secondary importance ascribed to mathematics in education.\\n\\nBut as in his philosophy, so also in the form of his State, he goes far\\nbeyond the old Pythagoreans. He attempts a task really impossible,\\nwhich is to unite the past of Greek history with the future of\\nphilosophy, analogous to that other impossibility, which has often been\\nthe dream of Christendom, the attempt to unite the past history of\\nEurope with the kingdom of Christ. Nothing actually existing in the\\nworld at all resembles Plato’s ideal State; nor does he himself imagine\\nthat such a State is possible. This he repeats again and again; e.g. in\\nthe Republic, or in the Laws where, casting a glance back on the\\nRepublic, he admits that the perfect state of communism and philosophy\\nwas impossible in his own age, though still to be retained as a\\npattern. The same doubt is implied in the earnestness with which he\\nargues in the Republic that ideals are none the worse because they\\ncannot be realized in fact, and in the chorus of laughter, which like a\\nbreaking wave will, as he anticipates, greet the mention of his\\nproposals; though like other writers of fiction, he uses all his art to\\ngive reality to his inventions. When asked how the ideal polity can\\ncome into being, he answers ironically, ‘When one son of a king becomes\\na philosopher’; he designates the fiction of the earth-born men as ‘a\\nnoble lie’; and when the structure is finally complete, he fairly tells\\nyou that his Republic is a vision only, which in some sense may have\\nreality, but not in the vulgar one of a reign of philosophers upon\\nearth. It has been said that Plato flies as well as walks, but this\\nfalls short of the truth; for he flies and walks at the same time, and\\nis in the air and on firm ground in successive instants.\\n\\nNiebuhr has asked a trifling question, which may be briefly noticed in\\nthis place—Was Plato a good citizen? If by this is meant, Was he loyal\\nto Athenian institutions?—he can hardly be said to be the friend of\\ndemocracy: but neither is he the friend of any other existing form of\\ngovernment; all of them he regarded as ‘states of faction’ (Laws); none\\nattained to his ideal of a voluntary rule over voluntary subjects,\\nwhich seems indeed more nearly to describe democracy than any other;\\nand the worst of them is tyranny. The truth is, that the question has\\nhardly any meaning when applied to a great philosopher whose writings\\nare not meant for a particular age and country, but for all time and\\nall mankind. The decline of Athenian politics was probably the motive\\nwhich led Plato to frame an ideal State, and the Republic may be\\nregarded as reflecting the departing glory of Hellas. As well might we\\ncomplain of St. Augustine, whose great work ‘The City of God’\\noriginated in a similar motive, for not being loyal to the Roman\\nEmpire. Even a nearer parallel might be afforded by the first\\nChristians, who cannot fairly be charged with being bad citizens\\nbecause, though ‘subject to the higher powers,’ they were looking\\nforward to a city which is in heaven.\\n\\n2. The idea of the perfect State is full of paradox when judged of\\naccording to the ordinary notions of mankind. The paradoxes of one age\\nhave been said to become the commonplaces of the next; but the\\nparadoxes of Plato are at least as paradoxical to us as they were to\\nhis contemporaries. The modern world has either sneered at them as\\nabsurd, or denounced them as unnatural and immoral; men have been\\npleased to find in Aristotle’s criticisms of them the anticipation of\\ntheir own good sense. The wealthy and cultivated classes have disliked\\nand also dreaded them; they have pointed with satisfaction to the\\nfailure of efforts to realize them in practice. Yet since they are the\\nthoughts of one of the greatest of human intelligences, and of one who\\nhad done most to elevate morality and religion, they seem to deserve a\\nbetter treatment at our hands. We may have to address the public, as\\nPlato does poetry, and assure them that we mean no harm to existing\\ninstitutions. There are serious errors which have a side of truth and\\nwhich therefore may fairly demand a careful consideration: there are\\ntruths mixed with error of which we may indeed say, ‘The half is better\\nthan the whole.’ Yet ‘the half’ may be an important contribution to the\\nstudy of human nature.\\n\\n(a) The first paradox is the community of goods, which is mentioned\\nslightly at the end of the third Book, and seemingly, as Aristotle\\nobserves, is confined to the guardians; at least no mention is made of\\nthe other classes. But the omission is not of any real significance,\\nand probably arises out of the plan of the work, which prevents the\\nwriter from entering into details.\\n\\nAristotle censures the community of property much in the spirit of\\nmodern political economy, as tending to repress industry, and as doing\\naway with the spirit of benevolence. Modern writers almost refuse to\\nconsider the subject, which is supposed to have been long ago settled\\nby the common opinion of mankind. But it must be remembered that the\\nsacredness of property is a notion far more fixed in modern than in\\nancient times. The world has grown older, and is therefore more\\nconservative. Primitive society offered many examples of land held in\\ncommon, either by a tribe or by a township, and such may probably have\\nbeen the original form of landed tenure. Ancient legislators had\\ninvented various modes of dividing and preserving the divisions of land\\namong the citizens; according to Aristotle there were nations who held\\nthe land in common and divided the produce, and there were others who\\ndivided the land and stored the produce in common. The evils of debt\\nand the inequality of property were far greater in ancient than in\\nmodern times, and the accidents to which property was subject from war,\\nor revolution, or taxation, or other legislative interference, were\\nalso greater. All these circumstances gave property a less fixed and\\nsacred character. The early Christians are believed to have held their\\nproperty in common, and the principle is sanctioned by the words of\\nChrist himself, and has been maintained as a counsel of perfection in\\nalmost all ages of the Church. Nor have there been wanting instances of\\nmodern enthusiasts who have made a religion of communism; in every age\\nof religious excitement notions like Wycliffe’s ‘inheritance of grace’\\nhave tended to prevail. A like spirit, but fiercer and more violent,\\nhas appeared in politics. ‘The preparation of the Gospel of peace’ soon\\nbecomes the red flag of Republicanism.\\n\\nWe can hardly judge what effect Plato’s views would have upon his own\\ncontemporaries; they would perhaps have seemed to them only an\\nexaggeration of the Spartan commonwealth. Even modern writers would\\nacknowledge that the right of private property is based on expediency,\\nand may be interfered with in a variety of ways for the public good.\\nAny other mode of vesting property which was found to be more\\nadvantageous, would in time acquire the same basis of right; ‘the most\\nuseful,’ in Plato’s words, ‘would be the most sacred.’ The lawyers and\\necclesiastics of former ages would have spoken of property as a sacred\\ninstitution. But they only meant by such language to oppose the\\ngreatest amount of resistance to any invasion of the rights of\\nindividuals and of the Church.\\n\\nWhen we consider the question, without any fear of immediate\\napplication to practice, in the spirit of Plato’s Republic, are we\\nquite sure that the received notions of property are the best? Is the\\ndistribution of wealth which is customary in civilized countries the\\nmost favourable that can be conceived for the education and development\\nof the mass of mankind? Can ‘the spectator of all time and all\\nexistence’ be quite convinced that one or two thousand years hence,\\ngreat changes will not have taken place in the rights of property, or\\neven that the very notion of property, beyond what is necessary for\\npersonal maintenance, may not have disappeared? This was a distinction\\nfamiliar to Aristotle, though likely to be laughed at among ourselves.\\nSuch a change would not be greater than some other changes through\\nwhich the world has passed in the transition from ancient to modern\\nsociety, for example, the emancipation of the serfs in Russia, or the\\nabolition of slavery in America and the West Indies; and not so great\\nas the difference which separates the Eastern village community from\\nthe Western world. To accomplish such a revolution in the course of a\\nfew centuries, would imply a rate of progress not more rapid than has\\nactually taken place during the last fifty or sixty years. The kingdom\\nof Japan underwent more change in five or six years than Europe in five\\nor six hundred. Many opinions and beliefs which have been cherished\\namong ourselves quite as strongly as the sacredness of property have\\npassed away; and the most untenable propositions respecting the right\\nof bequests or entail have been maintained with as much fervour as the\\nmost moderate. Some one will be heard to ask whether a state of society\\ncan be final in which the interests of thousands are perilled on the\\nlife or character of a single person. And many will indulge the hope\\nthat our present condition may, after all, be only transitional, and\\nmay conduct to a higher, in which property, besides ministering to the\\nenjoyment of the few, may also furnish the means of the highest culture\\nto all, and will be a greater benefit to the public generally, and also\\nmore under the control of public authority. There may come a time when\\nthe saying, ‘Have I not a right to do what I will with my own?’ will\\nappear to be a barbarous relic of individualism;—when the possession of\\na part may be a greater blessing to each and all than the possession of\\nthe whole is now to any one.\\n\\nSuch reflections appear visionary to the eye of the practical\\nstatesman, but they are within the range of possibility to the\\nphilosopher. He can imagine that in some distant age or clime, and\\nthrough the influence of some individual, the notion of common property\\nmay or might have sunk as deep into the heart of a race, and have\\nbecome as fixed to them, as private property is to ourselves. He knows\\nthat this latter institution is not more than four or five thousand\\nyears old: may not the end revert to the beginning? In our own age even\\nUtopias affect the spirit of legislation, and an abstract idea may\\nexercise a great influence on practical politics.\\n\\nThe objections that would be generally urged against Plato’s community\\nof property, are the old ones of Aristotle, that motives for exertion\\nwould be taken away, and that disputes would arise when each was\\ndependent upon all. Every man would produce as little and consume as\\nmuch as he liked. The experience of civilized nations has hitherto been\\nadverse to Socialism. The effort is too great for human nature; men try\\nto live in common, but the personal feeling is always breaking in. On\\nthe other hand it may be doubted whether our present notions of\\nproperty are not conventional, for they differ in different countries\\nand in different states of society. We boast of an individualism which\\nis not freedom, but rather an artificial result of the industrial state\\nof modern Europe. The individual is nominally free, but he is also\\npowerless in a world bound hand and foot in the chains of economic\\nnecessity. Even if we cannot expect the mass of mankind to become\\ndisinterested, at any rate we observe in them a power of organization\\nwhich fifty years ago would never have been suspected. The same forces\\nwhich have revolutionized the political system of Europe, may effect a\\nsimilar change in the social and industrial relations of mankind. And\\nif we suppose the influence of some good as well as neutral motives\\nworking in the community, there will be no absurdity in expecting that\\nthe mass of mankind having power, and becoming enlightened about the\\nhigher possibilities of human life, when they learn how much more is\\nattainable for all than is at present the possession of a favoured few,\\nmay pursue the common interest with an intelligence and persistency\\nwhich mankind have hitherto never seen.\\n\\nNow that the world has once been set in motion, and is no longer held\\nfast under the tyranny of custom and ignorance; now that criticism has\\npierced the veil of tradition and the past no longer overpowers the\\npresent,—the progress of civilization may be expected to be far greater\\nand swifter than heretofore. Even at our present rate of speed the\\npoint at which we may arrive in two or three generations is beyond the\\npower of imagination to foresee. There are forces in the world which\\nwork, not in an arithmetical, but in a geometrical ratio of increase.\\nEducation, to use the expression of Plato, moves like a wheel with an\\never-multiplying rapidity. Nor can we say how great may be its\\ninfluence, when it becomes universal,—when it has been inherited by\\nmany generations,—when it is freed from the trammels of superstition\\nand rightly adapted to the wants and capacities of different classes of\\nmen and women. Neither do we know how much more the co-operation of\\nminds or of hands may be capable of accomplishing, whether in labour or\\nin study. The resources of the natural sciences are not half-developed\\nas yet; the soil of the earth, instead of growing more barren, may\\nbecome many times more fertile than hitherto; the uses of machinery far\\ngreater, and also more minute than at present. New secrets of\\nphysiology may be revealed, deeply affecting human nature in its\\ninnermost recesses. The standard of health may be raised and the lives\\nof men prolonged by sanitary and medical knowledge. There may be peace,\\nthere may be leisure, there may be innocent refreshments of many kinds.\\nThe ever-increasing power of locomotion may join the extremes of earth.\\nThere may be mysterious workings of the human mind, such as occur only\\nat great crises of history. The East and the West may meet together,\\nand all nations may contribute their thoughts and their experience to\\nthe common stock of humanity. Many other elements enter into a\\nspeculation of this kind. But it is better to make an end of them. For\\nsuch reflections appear to the majority far-fetched, and to men of\\nscience, commonplace.\\n\\n(b) Neither to the mind of Plato nor of Aristotle did the doctrine of\\ncommunity of property present at all the same difficulty, or appear to\\nbe the same violation of the common Hellenic sentiment, as the\\ncommunity of wives and children. This paradox he prefaces by another\\nproposal, that the occupations of men and women shall be the same, and\\nthat to this end they shall have a common training and education. Male\\nand female animals have the same pursuits—why not also the two sexes of\\nman?\\n\\nBut have we not here fallen into a contradiction? for we were saying\\nthat different natures should have different pursuits. How then can men\\nand women have the same? And is not the proposal inconsistent with our\\nnotion of the division of labour?—These objections are no sooner raised\\nthan answered; for, according to Plato, there is no organic difference\\nbetween men and women, but only the accidental one that men beget and\\nwomen bear children. Following the analogy of the other animals, he\\ncontends that all natural gifts are scattered about indifferently among\\nboth sexes, though there may be a superiority of degree on the part of\\nthe men. The objection on the score of decency to their taking part in\\nthe same gymnastic exercises, is met by Plato’s assertion that the\\nexisting feeling is a matter of habit.\\n\\nThat Plato should have emancipated himself from the ideas of his own\\ncountry and from the example of the East, shows a wonderful\\nindependence of mind. He is conscious that women are half the human\\nrace, in some respects the more important half (Laws); and for the sake\\nboth of men and women he desires to raise the woman to a higher level\\nof existence. He brings, not sentiment, but philosophy to bear upon a\\nquestion which both in ancient and modern times has been chiefly\\nregarded in the light of custom or feeling. The Greeks had noble\\nconceptions of womanhood in the goddesses Athene and Artemis, and in\\nthe heroines Antigone and Andromache. But these ideals had no\\ncounterpart in actual life. The Athenian woman was in no way the equal\\nof her husband; she was not the entertainer of his guests or the\\nmistress of his house, but only his housekeeper and the mother of his\\nchildren. She took no part in military or political matters; nor is\\nthere any instance in the later ages of Greece of a woman becoming\\nfamous in literature. ‘Hers is the greatest glory who has the least\\nrenown among men,’ is the historian’s conception of feminine\\nexcellence. A very different ideal of womanhood is held up by Plato to\\nthe world; she is to be the companion of the man, and to share with him\\nin the toils of war and in the cares of government. She is to be\\nsimilarly trained both in bodily and mental exercises. She is to lose\\nas far as possible the incidents of maternity and the characteristics\\nof the female sex.\\n\\nThe modern antagonist of the equality of the sexes would argue that the\\ndifferences between men and women are not confined to the single point\\nurged by Plato; that sensibility, gentleness, grace, are the qualities\\nof women, while energy, strength, higher intelligence, are to be looked\\nfor in men. And the criticism is just: the differences affect the whole\\nnature, and are not, as Plato supposes, confined to a single point. But\\nneither can we say how far these differences are due to education and\\nthe opinions of mankind, or physically inherited from the habits and\\nopinions of former generations. Women have been always taught, not\\nexactly that they are slaves, but that they are in an inferior\\nposition, which is also supposed to have compensating advantages; and\\nto this position they have conformed. It is also true that the physical\\nform may easily change in the course of generations through the mode of\\nlife; and the weakness or delicacy, which was once a matter of opinion,\\nmay become a physical fact. The characteristics of sex vary greatly in\\ndifferent countries and ranks of society, and at different ages in the\\nsame individuals. Plato may have been right in denying that there was\\nany ultimate difference in the sexes of man other than that which\\nexists in animals, because all other differences may be conceived to\\ndisappear in other states of society, or under different circumstances\\nof life and training.\\n\\nThe first wave having been passed, we proceed to the second—community\\nof wives and children. ‘Is it possible? Is it desirable?’ For as\\nGlaucon intimates, and as we far more strongly insist, ‘Great doubts\\nmay be entertained about both these points.’ Any free discussion of the\\nquestion is impossible, and mankind are perhaps right in not allowing\\nthe ultimate bases of social life to be examined. Few of us can safely\\nenquire into the things which nature hides, any more than we can\\ndissect our own bodies. Still, the manner in which Plato arrived at his\\nconclusions should be considered. For here, as Mr. Grote has remarked,\\nis a wonderful thing, that one of the wisest and best of men should\\nhave entertained ideas of morality which are wholly at variance with\\nour own. And if we would do Plato justice, we must examine carefully\\nthe character of his proposals. First, we may observe that the\\nrelations of the sexes supposed by him are the reverse of licentious:\\nhe seems rather to aim at an impossible strictness. Secondly, he\\nconceives the family to be the natural enemy of the state; and he\\nentertains the serious hope that an universal brotherhood may take the\\nplace of private interests—an aspiration which, although not justified\\nby experience, has possessed many noble minds. On the other hand, there\\nis no sentiment or imagination in the connections which men and women\\nare supposed by him to form; human beings return to the level of the\\nanimals, neither exalting to heaven, nor yet abusing the natural\\ninstincts. All that world of poetry and fancy which the passion of love\\nhas called forth in modern literature and romance would have been\\nbanished by Plato. The arrangements of marriage in the Republic are\\ndirected to one object—the improvement of the race. In successive\\ngenerations a great development both of bodily and mental qualities\\nmight be possible. The analogy of animals tends to show that mankind\\ncan within certain limits receive a change of nature. And as in animals\\nwe should commonly choose the best for breeding, and destroy the\\nothers, so there must be a selection made of the human beings whose\\nlives are worthy to be preserved.\\n\\nWe start back horrified from this Platonic ideal, in the belief, first,\\nthat the higher feelings of humanity are far too strong to be crushed\\nout; secondly, that if the plan could be carried into execution we\\nshould be poorly recompensed by improvements in the breed for the loss\\nof the best things in life. The greatest regard for the weakest and\\nmeanest of human beings—the infant, the criminal, the insane, the\\nidiot, truly seems to us one of the noblest results of Christianity. We\\nhave learned, though as yet imperfectly, that the individual man has an\\nendless value in the sight of God, and that we honour Him when we\\nhonour the darkened and disfigured image of Him (Laws). This is the\\nlesson which Christ taught in a parable when He said, ‘Their angels do\\nalways behold the face of My Father which is in heaven.’ Such lessons\\nare only partially realized in any age; they were foreign to the age of\\nPlato, as they have very different degrees of strength in different\\ncountries or ages of the Christian world. To the Greek the family was a\\nreligious and customary institution binding the members together by a\\ntie inferior in strength to that of friendship, and having a less\\nsolemn and sacred sound than that of country. The relationship which\\nexisted on the lower level of custom, Plato imagined that he was\\nraising to the higher level of nature and reason; while from the modern\\nand Christian point of view we regard him as sanctioning murder and\\ndestroying the first principles of morality.\\n\\nThe great error in these and similar speculations is that the\\ndifference between man and the animals is forgotten in them. The human\\nbeing is regarded with the eye of a dog- or bird-fancier, or at best of\\na slave-owner; the higher or human qualities are left out. The breeder\\nof animals aims chiefly at size or speed or strength; in a few cases at\\ncourage or temper; most often the fitness of the animal for food is the\\ngreat desideratum. But mankind are not bred to be eaten, nor yet for\\ntheir superiority in fighting or in running or in drawing carts.\\nNeither does the improvement of the human race consist merely in the\\nincrease of the bones and flesh, but in the growth and enlightenment of\\nthe mind. Hence there must be ‘a marriage of true minds’ as well as of\\nbodies, of imagination and reason as well as of lusts and instincts.\\nMen and women without feeling or imagination are justly called brutes;\\nyet Plato takes away these qualities and puts nothing in their place,\\nnot even the desire of a noble offspring, since parents are not to know\\ntheir own children. The most important transaction of social life, he\\nwho is the idealist philosopher converts into the most brutal. For the\\npair are to have no relation to one another, except at the hymeneal\\nfestival; their children are not theirs, but the state’s; nor is any\\ntie of affection to unite them. Yet here the analogy of the animals\\nmight have saved Plato from a gigantic error, if he had ‘not lost sight\\nof his own illustration.’ For the ‘nobler sort of birds and beasts’\\nnourish and protect their offspring and are faithful to one another.\\n\\nAn eminent physiologist thinks it worth while ‘to try and place life on\\na physical basis.’ But should not life rest on the moral rather than\\nupon the physical? The higher comes first, then the lower, first the\\nhuman and rational, afterwards the animal. Yet they are not absolutely\\ndivided; and in times of sickness or moments of self-indulgence they\\nseem to be only different aspects of a common human nature which\\nincludes them both. Neither is the moral the limit of the physical, but\\nthe expansion and enlargement of it,—the highest form which the\\nphysical is capable of receiving. As Plato would say, the body does not\\ntake care of the body, and still less of the mind, but the mind takes\\ncare of both. In all human action not that which is common to man and\\nthe animals is the characteristic element, but that which distinguishes\\nhim from them. Even if we admit the physical basis, and resolve all\\nvirtue into health of body ‘la facon que notre sang circule,’ still on\\nmerely physical grounds we must come back to ideas. Mind and reason and\\nduty and conscience, under these or other names, are always\\nreappearing. There cannot be health of body without health of mind; nor\\nhealth of mind without the sense of duty and the love of truth (Charm).\\n\\nThat the greatest of ancient philosophers should in his regulations\\nabout marriage have fallen into the error of separating body and mind,\\ndoes indeed appear surprising. Yet the wonder is not so much that Plato\\nshould have entertained ideas of morality which to our own age are\\nrevolting, but that he should have contradicted himself to an extent\\nwhich is hardly credible, falling in an instant from the heaven of\\nidealism into the crudest animalism. Rejoicing in the newly found gift\\nof reflection, he appears to have thought out a subject about which he\\nhad better have followed the enlightened feeling of his own age. The\\ngeneral sentiment of Hellas was opposed to his monstrous fancy. The old\\npoets, and in later time the tragedians, showed no want of respect for\\nthe family, on which much of their religion was based. But the example\\nof Sparta, and perhaps in some degree the tendency to defy public\\nopinion, seems to have misled him. He will make one family out of all\\nthe families of the state. He will select the finest specimens of men\\nand women and breed from these only.\\n\\nYet because the illusion is always returning (for the animal part of\\nhuman nature will from time to time assert itself in the disguise of\\nphilosophy as well as of poetry), and also because any departure from\\nestablished morality, even where this is not intended, is apt to be\\nunsettling, it may be worth while to draw out a little more at length\\nthe objections to the Platonic marriage. In the first place, history\\nshows that wherever polygamy has been largely allowed the race has\\ndeteriorated. One man to one woman is the law of God and nature. Nearly\\nall the civilized peoples of the world at some period before the age of\\nwritten records, have become monogamists; and the step when once taken\\nhas never been retraced. The exceptions occurring among Brahmins or\\nMahometans or the ancient Persians, are of that sort which may be said\\nto prove the rule. The connexions formed between superior and inferior\\nraces hardly ever produce a noble offspring, because they are\\nlicentious; and because the children in such cases usually despise the\\nmother and are neglected by the father who is ashamed of them.\\nBarbarous nations when they are introduced by Europeans to vice die\\nout; polygamist peoples either import and adopt children from other\\ncountries, or dwindle in numbers, or both. Dynasties and aristocracies\\nwhich have disregarded the laws of nature have decreased in numbers and\\ndegenerated in stature; ‘mariages de convenance’ leave their enfeebling\\nstamp on the offspring of them (King Lear). The marriage of near\\nrelations, or the marrying in and in of the same family tends\\nconstantly to weakness or idiocy in the children, sometimes assuming\\nthe form as they grow older of passionate licentiousness. The common\\nprostitute rarely has any offspring. By such unmistakable evidence is\\nthe authority of morality asserted in the relations of the sexes: and\\nso many more elements enter into this ‘mystery’ than are dreamed of by\\nPlato and some other philosophers.\\n\\nRecent enquirers have indeed arrived at the conclusion that among\\nprimitive tribes there existed a community of wives as of property, and\\nthat the captive taken by the spear was the only wife or slave whom any\\nman was permitted to call his own. The partial existence of such\\ncustoms among some of the lower races of man, and the survival of\\npeculiar ceremonies in the marriages of some civilized nations, are\\nthought to furnish a proof of similar institutions having been once\\nuniversal. There can be no question that the study of anthropology has\\nconsiderably changed our views respecting the first appearance of man\\nupon the earth. We know more about the aborigines of the world than\\nformerly, but our increasing knowledge shows above all things how\\nlittle we know. With all the helps which written monuments afford, we\\ndo but faintly realize the condition of man two thousand or three\\nthousand years ago. Of what his condition was when removed to a\\ndistance 200,000 or 300,000 years, when the majority of mankind were\\nlower and nearer the animals than any tribe now existing upon the\\nearth, we cannot even entertain conjecture. Plato (Laws) and Aristotle\\n(Metaph.) may have been more right than we imagine in supposing that\\nsome forms of civilisation were discovered and lost several times over.\\nIf we cannot argue that all barbarism is a degraded civilization,\\nneither can we set any limits to the depth of degradation to which the\\nhuman race may sink through war, disease, or isolation. And if we are\\nto draw inferences about the origin of marriage from the practice of\\nbarbarous nations, we should also consider the remoter analogy of the\\nanimals. Many birds and animals, especially the carnivorous, have only\\none mate, and the love and care of offspring which seems to be natural\\nis inconsistent with the primitive theory of marriage. If we go back to\\nan imaginary state in which men were almost animals and the companions\\nof them, we have as much right to argue from what is animal to what is\\nhuman as from the barbarous to the civilized man. The record of animal\\nlife on the globe is fragmentary,—the connecting links are wanting and\\ncannot be supplied; the record of social life is still more fragmentary\\nand precarious. Even if we admit that our first ancestors had no such\\ninstitution as marriage, still the stages by which men passed from\\nouter barbarism to the comparative civilization of China, Assyria, and\\nGreece, or even of the ancient Germans, are wholly unknown to us.\\n\\nSuch speculations are apt to be unsettling, because they seem to show\\nthat an institution which was thought to be a revelation from heaven,\\nis only the growth of history and experience. We ask what is the origin\\nof marriage, and we are told that like the right of property, after\\nmany wars and contests, it has gradually arisen out of the selfishness\\nof barbarians. We stand face to face with human nature in its primitive\\nnakedness. We are compelled to accept, not the highest, but the lowest\\naccount of the origin of human society. But on the other hand we may\\ntruly say that every step in human progress has been in the same\\ndirection, and that in the course of ages the idea of marriage and of\\nthe family has been more and more defined and consecrated. The\\ncivilized East is immeasurably in advance of any savage tribes; the\\nGreeks and Romans have improved upon the East; the Christian nations\\nhave been stricter in their views of the marriage relation than any of\\nthe ancients. In this as in so many other things, instead of looking\\nback with regret to the past, we should look forward with hope to the\\nfuture. We must consecrate that which we believe to be the most holy,\\nand that ‘which is the most holy will be the most useful.’ There is\\nmore reason for maintaining the sacredness of the marriage tie, when we\\nsee the benefit of it, than when we only felt a vague religious horror\\nabout the violation of it. But in all times of transition, when\\nestablished beliefs are being undermined, there is a danger that in the\\npassage from the old to the new we may insensibly let go the moral\\nprinciple, finding an excuse for listening to the voice of passion in\\nthe uncertainty of knowledge, or the fluctuations of opinion. And there\\nare many persons in our own day who, enlightened by the study of\\nanthropology, and fascinated by what is new and strange, some using the\\nlanguage of fear, others of hope, are inclined to believe that a time\\nwill come when through the self-assertion of women, or the rebellious\\nspirit of children, by the analysis of human relations, or by the force\\nof outward circumstances, the ties of family life may be broken or\\ngreatly relaxed. They point to societies in America and elsewhere which\\ntend to show that the destruction of the family need not necessarily\\ninvolve the overthrow of all morality. Wherever we may think of such\\nspeculations, we can hardly deny that they have been more rife in this\\ngeneration than in any other; and whither they are tending, who can\\npredict?\\n\\nTo the doubts and queries raised by these ‘social reformers’ respecting\\nthe relation of the sexes and the moral nature of man, there is a\\nsufficient answer, if any is needed. The difference about them and us\\nis really one of fact. They are speaking of man as they wish or fancy\\nhim to be, but we are speaking of him as he is. They isolate the animal\\npart of his nature; we regard him as a creature having many sides, or\\naspects, moving between good and evil, striving to rise above himself\\nand to become ‘a little lower than the angels.’ We also, to use a\\nPlatonic formula, are not ignorant of the dissatisfactions and\\nincompatibilities of family life, of the meannesses of trade, of the\\nflatteries of one class of society by another, of the impediments which\\nthe family throws in the way of lofty aims and aspirations. But we are\\nconscious that there are evils and dangers in the background greater\\nstill, which are not appreciated, because they are either concealed or\\nsuppressed. What a condition of man would that be, in which human\\npassions were controlled by no authority, divine or human, in which\\nthere was no shame or decency, no higher affection overcoming or\\nsanctifying the natural instincts, but simply a rule of health! Is it\\nfor this that we are asked to throw away the civilization which is the\\ngrowth of ages?\\n\\nFor strength and health are not the only qualities to be desired; there\\nare the more important considerations of mind and character and soul.\\nWe know how human nature may be degraded; we do not know how by\\nartificial means any improvement in the breed can be effected. The\\nproblem is a complex one, for if we go back only four steps (and these\\nat least enter into the composition of a child), there are commonly\\nthirty progenitors to be taken into account. Many curious facts, rarely\\nadmitting of proof, are told us respecting the inheritance of disease\\nor character from a remote ancestor. We can trace the physical\\nresemblances of parents and children in the same family—\\n\\n‘Sic oculos, sic ille manus, sic ora ferebat’;\\n\\nbut scarcely less often the differences which distinguish children both\\nfrom their parents and from one another. We are told of similar mental\\npeculiarities running in families, and again of a tendency, as in the\\nanimals, to revert to a common or original stock. But we have a\\ndifficulty in distinguishing what is a true inheritance of genius or\\nother qualities, and what is mere imitation or the result of similar\\ncircumstances. Great men and great women have rarely had great fathers\\nand mothers. Nothing that we know of in the circumstances of their\\nbirth or lineage will explain their appearance. Of the English poets of\\nthe last and two preceding centuries scarcely a descendant\\nremains,—none have ever been distinguished. So deeply has nature hidden\\nher secret, and so ridiculous is the fancy which has been entertained\\nby some that we might in time by suitable marriage arrangements or, as\\nPlato would have said, ‘by an ingenious system of lots,’ produce a\\nShakespeare or a Milton. Even supposing that we could breed men having\\nthe tenacity of bulldogs, or, like the Spartans, ‘lacking the wit to\\nrun away in battle,’ would the world be any the better? Many of the\\nnoblest specimens of the human race have been among the weakest\\nphysically. Tyrtaeus or Aesop, or our own Newton, would have been\\nexposed at Sparta; and some of the fairest and strongest men and women\\nhave been among the wickedest and worst. Not by the Platonic device of\\nuniting the strong and fair with the strong and fair, regardless of\\nsentiment and morality, nor yet by his other device of combining\\ndissimilar natures (Statesman), have mankind gradually passed from the\\nbrutality and licentiousness of primitive marriage to marriage\\nChristian and civilized.\\n\\nFew persons would deny that we bring into the world an inheritance of\\nmental and physical qualities derived first from our parents, or\\nthrough them from some remoter ancestor, secondly from our race,\\nthirdly from the general condition of mankind into which we are born.\\nNothing is commoner than the remark, that ‘So and so is like his father\\nor his uncle’; and an aged person may not unfrequently note a\\nresemblance in a youth to a long-forgotten ancestor, observing that\\n‘Nature sometimes skips a generation.’ It may be true also, that if we\\nknew more about our ancestors, these similarities would be even more\\nstriking to us. Admitting the facts which are thus described in a\\npopular way, we may however remark that there is no method of\\ndifference by which they can be defined or estimated, and that they\\nconstitute only a small part of each individual. The doctrine of\\nheredity may seem to take out of our hands the conduct of our own\\nlives, but it is the idea, not the fact, which is really terrible to\\nus. For what we have received from our ancestors is only a fraction of\\nwhat we are, or may become. The knowledge that drunkenness or insanity\\nhas been prevalent in a family may be the best safeguard against their\\nrecurrence in a future generation. The parent will be most awake to the\\nvices or diseases in his child of which he is most sensible within\\nhimself. The whole of life may be directed to their prevention or cure.\\nThe traces of consumption may become fainter, or be wholly effaced: the\\ninherent tendency to vice or crime may be eradicated. And so heredity,\\nfrom being a curse, may become a blessing. We acknowledge that in the\\nmatter of our birth, as in our nature generally, there are previous\\ncircumstances which affect us. But upon this platform of circumstances\\nor within this wall of necessity, we have still the power of creating a\\nlife for ourselves by the informing energy of the human will.\\n\\nThere is another aspect of the marriage question to which Plato is a\\nstranger. All the children born in his state are foundlings. It never\\noccurred to him that the greater part of them, according to universal\\nexperience, would have perished. For children can only be brought up in\\nfamilies. There is a subtle sympathy between the mother and the child\\nwhich cannot be supplied by other mothers, or by ‘strong nurses one or\\nmore’ (Laws). If Plato’s ‘pen’ was as fatal as the Creches of Paris, or\\nthe foundling hospital of Dublin, more than nine-tenths of his children\\nwould have perished. There would have been no need to expose or put out\\nof the way the weaklier children, for they would have died of\\nthemselves. So emphatically does nature protest against the destruction\\nof the family.\\n\\nWhat Plato had heard or seen of Sparta was applied by him in a mistaken\\nway to his ideal commonwealth. He probably observed that both the\\nSpartan men and women were superior in form and strength to the other\\nGreeks; and this superiority he was disposed to attribute to the laws\\nand customs relating to marriage. He did not consider that the desire\\nof a noble offspring was a passion among the Spartans, or that their\\nphysical superiority was to be attributed chiefly, not to their\\nmarriage customs, but to their temperance and training. He did not\\nreflect that Sparta was great, not in consequence of the relaxation of\\nmorality, but in spite of it, by virtue of a political principle\\nstronger far than existed in any other Grecian state. Least of all did\\nhe observe that Sparta did not really produce the finest specimens of\\nthe Greek race. The genius, the political inspiration of Athens, the\\nlove of liberty—all that has made Greece famous with posterity, were\\nwanting among the Spartans. They had no Themistocles, or Pericles, or\\nAeschylus, or Sophocles, or Socrates, or Plato. The individual was not\\nallowed to appear above the state; the laws were fixed, and he had no\\nbusiness to alter or reform them. Yet whence has the progress of cities\\nand nations arisen, if not from remarkable individuals, coming into the\\nworld we know not how, and from causes over which we have no control?\\nSomething too much may have been said in modern times of the value of\\nindividuality. But we can hardly condemn too strongly a system which,\\ninstead of fostering the scattered seeds or sparks of genius and\\ncharacter, tends to smother and extinguish them.\\n\\nStill, while condemning Plato, we must acknowledge that neither\\nChristianity, nor any other form of religion and society, has hitherto\\nbeen able to cope with this most difficult of social problems, and that\\nthe side from which Plato regarded it is that from which we turn away.\\nPopulation is the most untameable force in the political and social\\nworld. Do we not find, especially in large cities, that the greatest\\nhindrance to the amelioration of the poor is their improvidence in\\nmarriage?—a small fault truly, if not involving endless consequences.\\nThere are whole countries too, such as India, or, nearer home, Ireland,\\nin which a right solution of the marriage question seems to lie at the\\nfoundation of the happiness of the community. There are too many people\\non a given space, or they marry too early and bring into the world a\\nsickly and half-developed offspring; or owing to the very conditions of\\ntheir existence, they become emaciated and hand on a similar life to\\ntheir descendants. But who can oppose the voice of prudence to the\\n‘mightiest passions of mankind’ (Laws), especially when they have been\\nlicensed by custom and religion? In addition to the influences of\\neducation, we seem to require some new principles of right and wrong in\\nthese matters, some force of opinion, which may indeed be already heard\\nwhispering in private, but has never affected the moral sentiments of\\nmankind in general. We unavoidably lose sight of the principle of\\nutility, just in that action of our lives in which we have the most\\nneed of it. The influences which we can bring to bear upon this\\nquestion are chiefly indirect. In a generation or two, education,\\nemigration, improvements in agriculture and manufactures, may have\\nprovided the solution. The state physician hardly likes to probe the\\nwound: it is beyond his art; a matter which he cannot safely let alone,\\nbut which he dare not touch:\\n\\n‘We do but skin and film the ulcerous place.’\\n\\nWhen again in private life we see a whole family one by one dropping\\ninto the grave under the Ate of some inherited malady, and the parents\\nperhaps surviving them, do our minds ever go back silently to that day\\ntwenty-five or thirty years before on which under the fairest auspices,\\namid the rejoicings of friends and acquaintances, a bride and\\nbridegroom joined hands with one another? In making such a reflection\\nwe are not opposing physical considerations to moral, but moral to\\nphysical; we are seeking to make the voice of reason heard, which\\ndrives us back from the extravagance of sentimentalism on common sense.\\nThe late Dr. Combe is said by his biographer to have resisted the\\ntemptation to marriage, because he knew that he was subject to\\nhereditary consumption. One who deserved to be called a man of genius,\\na friend of my youth, was in the habit of wearing a black ribbon on his\\nwrist, in order to remind him that, being liable to outbreaks of\\ninsanity, he must not give way to the natural impulses of affection: he\\ndied unmarried in a lunatic asylum. These two little facts suggest the\\nreflection that a very few persons have done from a sense of duty what\\nthe rest of mankind ought to have done under like circumstances, if\\nthey had allowed themselves to think of all the misery which they were\\nabout to bring into the world. If we could prevent such marriages\\nwithout any violation of feeling or propriety, we clearly ought; and\\nthe prohibition in the course of time would be protected by a ‘horror\\nnaturalis’ similar to that which, in all civilized ages and countries,\\nhas prevented the marriage of near relations by blood. Mankind would\\nhave been the happier, if some things which are now allowed had from\\nthe beginning been denied to them; if the sanction of religion could\\nhave prohibited practices inimical to health; if sanitary principles\\ncould in early ages have been invested with a superstitious awe. But,\\nliving as we do far on in the world’s history, we are no longer able to\\nstamp at once with the impress of religion a new prohibition. A free\\nagent cannot have his fancies regulated by law; and the execution of\\nthe law would be rendered impossible, owing to the uncertainty of the\\ncases in which marriage was to be forbidden. Who can weigh virtue, or\\neven fortune against health, or moral and mental qualities against\\nbodily? Who can measure probabilities against certainties? There has\\nbeen some good as well as evil in the discipline of suffering; and\\nthere are diseases, such as consumption, which have exercised a\\nrefining and softening influence on the character. Youth is too\\ninexperienced to balance such nice considerations; parents do not often\\nthink of them, or think of them too late. They are at a distance and\\nmay probably be averted; change of place, a new state of life, the\\ninterests of a home may be the cure of them. So persons vainly reason\\nwhen their minds are already made up and their fortunes irrevocably\\nlinked together. Nor is there any ground for supposing that marriages\\nare to any great extent influenced by reflections of this sort, which\\nseem unable to make any head against the irresistible impulse of\\nindividual attachment.\\n\\nLastly, no one can have observed the first rising flood of the passions\\nin youth, the difficulty of regulating them, and the effects on the\\nwhole mind and nature which follow from them, the stimulus which is\\ngiven to them by the imagination, without feeling that there is\\nsomething unsatisfactory in our method of treating them. That the most\\nimportant influence on human life should be wholly left to chance or\\nshrouded in mystery, and instead of being disciplined or understood,\\nshould be required to conform only to an external standard of\\npropriety—cannot be regarded by the philosopher as a safe or\\nsatisfactory condition of human things. And still those who have the\\ncharge of youth may find a way by watchfulness, by affection, by the\\nmanliness and innocence of their own lives, by occasional hints, by\\ngeneral admonitions which every one can apply for himself, to mitigate\\nthis terrible evil which eats out the heart of individuals and corrupts\\nthe moral sentiments of nations. In no duty towards others is there\\nmore need of reticence and self-restraint. So great is the danger lest\\nhe who would be the counsellor of another should reveal the secret\\nprematurely, lest he should get another too much into his power; or fix\\nthe passing impression of evil by demanding the confession of it.\\n\\nNor is Plato wrong in asserting that family attachments may interfere\\nwith higher aims. If there have been some who ‘to party gave up what\\nwas meant for mankind,’ there have certainly been others who to family\\ngave up what was meant for mankind or for their country. The cares of\\nchildren, the necessity of procuring money for their support, the\\nflatteries of the rich by the poor, the exclusiveness of caste, the\\npride of birth or wealth, the tendency of family life to divert men\\nfrom the pursuit of the ideal or the heroic, are as lowering in our own\\nage as in that of Plato. And if we prefer to look at the gentle\\ninfluences of home, the development of the affections, the amenities of\\nsociety, the devotion of one member of a family for the good of the\\nothers, which form one side of the picture, we must not quarrel with\\nhim, or perhaps ought rather to be grateful to him, for having\\npresented to us the reverse. Without attempting to defend Plato on\\ngrounds of morality, we may allow that there is an aspect of the world\\nwhich has not unnaturally led him into error.\\n\\nWe hardly appreciate the power which the idea of the State, like all\\nother abstract ideas, exercised over the mind of Plato. To us the State\\nseems to be built up out of the family, or sometimes to be the\\nframework in which family and social life is contained. But to Plato in\\nhis present mood of mind the family is only a disturbing influence\\nwhich, instead of filling up, tends to disarrange the higher unity of\\nthe State. No organization is needed except a political, which,\\nregarded from another point of view, is a military one. The State is\\nall-sufficing for the wants of man, and, like the idea of the Church in\\nlater ages, absorbs all other desires and affections. In time of war\\nthe thousand citizens are to stand like a rampart impregnable against\\nthe world or the Persian host; in time of peace the preparation for war\\nand their duties to the State, which are also their duties to one\\nanother, take up their whole life and time. The only other interest\\nwhich is allowed to them besides that of war, is the interest of\\nphilosophy. When they are too old to be soldiers they are to retire\\nfrom active life and to have a second novitiate of study and\\ncontemplation. There is an element of monasticism even in Plato’s\\ncommunism. If he could have done without children, he might have\\nconverted his Republic into a religious order. Neither in the Laws,\\nwhen the daylight of common sense breaks in upon him, does he retract\\nhis error. In the state of which he would be the founder, there is no\\nmarrying or giving in marriage: but because of the infirmity of\\nmankind, he condescends to allow the law of nature to prevail.\\n\\n(c) But Plato has an equal, or, in his own estimation, even greater\\nparadox in reserve, which is summed up in the famous text, ‘Until kings\\nare philosophers or philosophers are kings, cities will never cease\\nfrom ill.’ And by philosophers he explains himself to mean those who\\nare capable of apprehending ideas, especially the idea of good. To the\\nattainment of this higher knowledge the second education is directed.\\nThrough a process of training which has already made them good citizens\\nthey are now to be made good legislators. We find with some surprise\\n(not unlike the feeling which Aristotle in a well-known passage\\ndescribes the hearers of Plato’s lectures as experiencing, when they\\nwent to a discourse on the idea of good, expecting to be instructed in\\nmoral truths, and received instead of them arithmetical and\\nmathematical formulae) that Plato does not propose for his future\\nlegislators any study of finance or law or military tactics, but only\\nof abstract mathematics, as a preparation for the still more abstract\\nconception of good. We ask, with Aristotle, What is the use of a man\\nknowing the idea of good, if he does not know what is good for this\\nindividual, this state, this condition of society? We cannot understand\\nhow Plato’s legislators or guardians are to be fitted for their work of\\nstatesmen by the study of the five mathematical sciences. We vainly\\nsearch in Plato’s own writings for any explanation of this seeming\\nabsurdity.\\n\\nThe discovery of a great metaphysical conception seems to ravish the\\nmind with a prophetic consciousness which takes away the power of\\nestimating its value. No metaphysical enquirer has ever fairly\\ncriticised his own speculations; in his own judgment they have been\\nabove criticism; nor has he understood that what to him seemed to be\\nabsolute truth may reappear in the next generation as a form of logic\\nor an instrument of thought. And posterity have also sometimes equally\\nmisapprehended the real value of his speculations. They appear to them\\nto have contributed nothing to the stock of human knowledge. The IDEA\\nof good is apt to be regarded by the modern thinker as an unmeaning\\nabstraction; but he forgets that this abstraction is waiting ready for\\nuse, and will hereafter be filled up by the divisions of knowledge.\\nWhen mankind do not as yet know that the world is subject to law, the\\nintroduction of the mere conception of law or design or final cause,\\nand the far-off anticipation of the harmony of knowledge, are great\\nsteps onward. Even the crude generalization of the unity of all things\\nleads men to view the world with different eyes, and may easily affect\\ntheir conception of human life and of politics, and also their own\\nconduct and character (Tim). We can imagine how a great mind like that\\nof Pericles might derive elevation from his intercourse with Anaxagoras\\n(Phaedr.). To be struggling towards a higher but unattainable\\nconception is a more favourable intellectual condition than to rest\\nsatisfied in a narrow portion of ascertained fact. And the earlier,\\nwhich have sometimes been the greater ideas of science, are often lost\\nsight of at a later period. How rarely can we say of any modern\\nenquirer in the magnificent language of Plato, that ‘He is the\\nspectator of all time and of all existence!’\\n\\nNor is there anything unnatural in the hasty application of these vast\\nmetaphysical conceptions to practical and political life. In the first\\nenthusiasm of ideas men are apt to see them everywhere, and to apply\\nthem in the most remote sphere. They do not understand that the\\nexperience of ages is required to enable them to fill up ‘the\\nintermediate axioms.’ Plato himself seems to have imagined that the\\ntruths of psychology, like those of astronomy and harmonics, would be\\narrived at by a process of deduction, and that the method which he has\\npursued in the Fourth Book, of inferring them from experience and the\\nuse of language, was imperfect and only provisional. But when, after\\nhaving arrived at the idea of good, which is the end of the science of\\ndialectic, he is asked, What is the nature, and what are the divisions\\nof the science? He refuses to answer, as if intending by the refusal to\\nintimate that the state of knowledge which then existed was not such as\\nwould allow the philosopher to enter into his final rest. The previous\\nsciences must first be studied, and will, we may add, continue to be\\nstudied tell the end of time, although in a sense different from any\\nwhich Plato could have conceived. But we may observe, that while he is\\naware of the vacancy of his own ideal, he is full of enthusiasm in the\\ncontemplation of it. Looking into the orb of light, he sees nothing,\\nbut he is warmed and elevated. The Hebrew prophet believed that faith\\nin God would enable him to govern the world; the Greek philosopher\\nimagined that contemplation of the good would make a legislator. There\\nis as much to be filled up in the one case as in the other, and the one\\nmode of conception is to the Israelite what the other is to the Greek.\\nBoth find a repose in a divine perfection, which, whether in a more\\npersonal or impersonal form, exists without them and independently of\\nthem, as well as within them.\\n\\nThere is no mention of the idea of good in the Timaeus, nor of the\\ndivine Creator of the world in the Republic; and we are naturally led\\nto ask in what relation they stand to one another. Is God above or\\nbelow the idea of good? Or is the Idea of Good another mode of\\nconceiving God? The latter appears to be the truer answer. To the Greek\\nphilosopher the perfection and unity of God was a far higher conception\\nthan his personality, which he hardly found a word to express, and\\nwhich to him would have seemed to be borrowed from mythology. To the\\nChristian, on the other hand, or to the modern thinker in general, it\\nis difficult, if not impossible, to attach reality to what he terms\\nmere abstraction; while to Plato this very abstraction is the truest\\nand most real of all things. Hence, from a difference in forms of\\nthought, Plato appears to be resting on a creation of his own mind\\nonly. But if we may be allowed to paraphrase the idea of good by the\\nwords ‘intelligent principle of law and order in the universe,\\nembracing equally man and nature,’ we begin to find a meeting-point\\nbetween him and ourselves.\\n\\nThe question whether the ruler or statesman should be a philosopher is\\none that has not lost interest in modern times. In most countries of\\nEurope and Asia there has been some one in the course of ages who has\\ntruly united the power of command with the power of thought and\\nreflection, as there have been also many false combinations of these\\nqualities. Some kind of speculative power is necessary both in\\npractical and political life; like the rhetorician in the Phaedrus, men\\nrequire to have a conception of the varieties of human character, and\\nto be raised on great occasions above the commonplaces of ordinary\\nlife. Yet the idea of the philosopher-statesman has never been popular\\nwith the mass of mankind; partly because he cannot take the world into\\nhis confidence or make them understand the motives from which he acts;\\nand also because they are jealous of a power which they do not\\nunderstand. The revolution which human nature desires to effect step by\\nstep in many ages is likely to be precipitated by him in a single year\\nor life. They are afraid that in the pursuit of his greater aims he may\\ndisregard the common feelings of humanity, he is too apt to be looking\\ninto the distant future or back into the remote past, and unable to see\\nactions or events which, to use an expression of Plato’s ‘are tumbling\\nout at his feet.’ Besides, as Plato would say, there are other\\ncorruptions of these philosophical statesmen. Either ‘the native hue of\\nresolution is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,’ and at the\\nmoment when action above all things is required he is undecided, or\\ngeneral principles are enunciated by him in order to cover some change\\nof policy; or his ignorance of the world has made him more easily fall\\na prey to the arts of others; or in some cases he has been converted\\ninto a courtier, who enjoys the luxury of holding liberal opinions, but\\nwas never known to perform a liberal action. No wonder that mankind\\nhave been in the habit of calling statesmen of this class pedants,\\nsophisters, doctrinaires, visionaries. For, as we may be allowed to\\nsay, a little parodying the words of Plato, ‘they have seen bad\\nimitations of the philosopher-statesman.’ But a man in whom the power\\nof thought and action are perfectly balanced, equal to the present,\\nreaching forward to the future, ‘such a one,’ ruling in a\\nconstitutional state, ‘they have never seen.’\\n\\nBut as the philosopher is apt to fail in the routine of political life,\\nso the ordinary statesman is also apt to fail in extraordinary crises.\\nWhen the face of the world is beginning to alter, and thunder is heard\\nin the distance, he is still guided by his old maxims, and is the slave\\nof his inveterate party prejudices; he cannot perceive the signs of the\\ntimes; instead of looking forward he looks back; he learns nothing and\\nforgets nothing; with ‘wise saws and modern instances’ he would stem\\nthe rising tide of revolution. He lives more and more within the circle\\nof his own party, as the world without him becomes stronger. This seems\\nto be the reason why the old order of things makes so poor a figure\\nwhen confronted with the new, why churches can never reform, why most\\npolitical changes are made blindly and convulsively. The great crises\\nin the history of nations have often been met by an ecclesiastical\\npositiveness, and a more obstinate reassertion of principles which have\\nlost their hold upon a nation. The fixed ideas of a reactionary\\nstatesman may be compared to madness; they grow upon him, and he\\nbecomes possessed by them; no judgement of others is ever admitted by\\nhim to be weighed in the balance against his own.\\n\\n(d) Plato, labouring under what, to modern readers, appears to have\\nbeen a confusion of ideas, assimilates the state to the individual, and\\nfails to distinguish Ethics from Politics. He thinks that to be most of\\na state which is most like one man, and in which the citizens have the\\ngreatest uniformity of character. He does not see that the analogy is\\npartly fallacious, and that the will or character of a state or nation\\nis really the balance or rather the surplus of individual wills, which\\nare limited by the condition of having to act in common. The movement\\nof a body of men can never have the pliancy or facility of a single\\nman; the freedom of the individual, which is always limited, becomes\\nstill more straitened when transferred to a nation. The powers of\\naction and feeling are necessarily weaker and more balanced when they\\nare diffused through a community; whence arises the often discussed\\nquestion, ‘Can a nation, like an individual, have a conscience?’ We\\nhesitate to say that the characters of nations are nothing more than\\nthe sum of the characters of the individuals who compose them; because\\nthere may be tendencies in individuals which react upon one another. A\\nwhole nation may be wiser than any one man in it; or may be animated by\\nsome common opinion or feeling which could not equally have affected\\nthe mind of a single person, or may have been inspired by a leader of\\ngenius to perform acts more than human. Plato does not appear to have\\nanalysed the complications which arise out of the collective action of\\nmankind. Neither is he capable of seeing that analogies, though\\nspecious as arguments, may often have no foundation in fact, or of\\ndistinguishing between what is intelligible or vividly present to the\\nmind, and what is true. In this respect he is far below Aristotle, who\\nis comparatively seldom imposed upon by false analogies. He cannot\\ndisentangle the arts from the virtues—at least he is always arguing\\nfrom one to the other. His notion of music is transferred from harmony\\nof sounds to harmony of life: in this he is assisted by the ambiguities\\nof language as well as by the prevalence of Pythagorean notions. And\\nhaving once assimilated the state to the individual, he imagines that\\nhe will find the succession of states paralleled in the lives of\\nindividuals.\\n\\nStill, through this fallacious medium, a real enlargement of ideas is\\nattained. When the virtues as yet presented no distinct conception to\\nthe mind, a great advance was made by the comparison of them with the\\narts; for virtue is partly art, and has an outward form as well as an\\ninward principle. The harmony of music affords a lively image of the\\nharmonies of the world and of human life, and may be regarded as a\\nsplendid illustration which was naturally mistaken for a real analogy.\\nIn the same way the identification of ethics with politics has a\\ntendency to give definiteness to ethics, and also to elevate and\\nennoble men’s notions of the aims of government and of the duties of\\ncitizens; for ethics from one point of view may be conceived as an\\nidealized law and politics; and politics, as ethics reduced to the\\nconditions of human society. There have been evils which have arisen\\nout of the attempt to identify them, and this has led to the separation\\nor antagonism of them, which has been introduced by modern political\\nwriters. But we may likewise feel that something has been lost in their\\nseparation, and that the ancient philosophers who estimated the moral\\nand intellectual wellbeing of mankind first, and the wealth of nations\\nand individuals second, may have a salutary influence on the\\nspeculations of modern times. Many political maxims originate in a\\nreaction against an opposite error; and when the errors against which\\nthey were directed have passed away, they in turn become errors.\\n\\n3. Plato’s views of education are in several respects remarkable; like\\nthe rest of the Republic they are partly Greek and partly ideal,\\nbeginning with the ordinary curriculum of the Greek youth, and\\nextending to after-life. Plato is the first writer who distinctly says\\nthat education is to comprehend the whole of life, and to be a\\npreparation for another in which education begins again. This is the\\ncontinuous thread which runs through the Republic, and which more than\\nany other of his ideas admits of an application to modern life.\\n\\nHe has long given up the notion that virtue cannot be taught; and he is\\ndisposed to modify the thesis of the Protagoras, that the virtues are\\none and not many. He is not unwilling to admit the sensible world into\\nhis scheme of truth. Nor does he assert in the Republic the\\ninvoluntariness of vice, which is maintained by him in the Timaeus,\\nSophist, and Laws (Protag., Apol., Gorg.). Nor do the so-called\\nPlatonic ideas recovered from a former state of existence affect his\\ntheory of mental improvement. Still we observe in him the remains of\\nthe old Socratic doctrine, that true knowledge must be elicited from\\nwithin, and is to be sought for in ideas, not in particulars of sense.\\nEducation, as he says, will implant a principle of intelligence which\\nis better than ten thousand eyes. The paradox that the virtues are one,\\nand the kindred notion that all virtue is knowledge, are not entirely\\nrenounced; the first is seen in the supremacy given to justice over the\\nrest; the second in the tendency to absorb the moral virtues in the\\nintellectual, and to centre all goodness in the contemplation of the\\nidea of good. The world of sense is still depreciated and identified\\nwith opinion, though admitted to be a shadow of the true. In the\\nRepublic he is evidently impressed with the conviction that vice arises\\nchiefly from ignorance and may be cured by education; the multitude are\\nhardly to be deemed responsible for what they do. A faint allusion to\\nthe doctrine of reminiscence occurs in the Tenth Book; but Plato’s\\nviews of education have no more real connection with a previous state\\nof existence than our own; he only proposes to elicit from the mind\\nthat which is there already. Education is represented by him, not as\\nthe filling of a vessel, but as the turning the eye of the soul towards\\nthe light.\\n\\nHe treats first of music or literature, which he divides into true and\\nfalse, and then goes on to gymnastics; of infancy in the Republic he\\ntakes no notice, though in the Laws he gives sage counsels about the\\nnursing of children and the management of the mothers, and would have\\nan education which is even prior to birth. But in the Republic he\\nbegins with the age at which the child is capable of receiving ideas,\\nand boldly asserts, in language which sounds paradoxical to modern\\nears, that he must be taught the false before he can learn the true.\\nThe modern and ancient philosophical world are not agreed about truth\\nand falsehood; the one identifies truth almost exclusively with fact,\\nthe other with ideas. This is the difference between ourselves and\\nPlato, which is, however, partly a difference of words. For we too\\nshould admit that a child must receive many lessons which he\\nimperfectly understands; he must be taught some things in a figure\\nonly, some too which he can hardly be expected to believe when he grows\\nolder; but we should limit the use of fiction by the necessity of the\\ncase. Plato would draw the line differently; according to him the aim\\nof early education is not truth as a matter of fact, but truth as a\\nmatter of principle; the child is to be taught first simple religious\\ntruths, and then simple moral truths, and insensibly to learn the\\nlesson of good manners and good taste. He would make an entire\\nreformation of the old mythology; like Xenophanes and Heracleitus he is\\nsensible of the deep chasm which separates his own age from Homer and\\nHesiod, whom he quotes and invests with an imaginary authority, but\\nonly for his own purposes. The lusts and treacheries of the gods are to\\nbe banished; the terrors of the world below are to be dispelled; the\\nmisbehaviour of the Homeric heroes is not to be a model for youth. But\\nthere is another strain heard in Homer which may teach our youth\\nendurance; and something may be learnt in medicine from the simple\\npractice of the Homeric age. The principles on which religion is to be\\nbased are two only: first, that God is true; secondly, that he is good.\\nModern and Christian writers have often fallen short of these; they can\\nhardly be said to have gone beyond them.\\n\\nThe young are to be brought up in happy surroundings, out of the way of\\nsights or sounds which may hurt the character or vitiate the taste.\\nThey are to live in an atmosphere of health; the breeze is always to be\\nwafting to them the impressions of truth and goodness. Could such an\\neducation be realized, or if our modern religious education could be\\nbound up with truth and virtue and good manners and good taste, that\\nwould be the best hope of human improvement. Plato, like ourselves, is\\nlooking forward to changes in the moral and religious world, and is\\npreparing for them. He recognizes the danger of unsettling young men’s\\nminds by sudden changes of laws and principles, by destroying the\\nsacredness of one set of ideas when there is nothing else to take their\\nplace. He is afraid too of the influence of the drama, on the ground\\nthat it encourages false sentiment, and therefore he would not have his\\nchildren taken to the theatre; he thinks that the effect on the\\nspectators is bad, and on the actors still worse. His idea of education\\nis that of harmonious growth, in which are insensibly learnt the\\nlessons of temperance and endurance, and the body and mind develope in\\nequal proportions. The first principle which runs through all art and\\nnature is simplicity; this also is to be the rule of human life.\\n\\nThe second stage of education is gymnastic, which answers to the period\\nof muscular growth and development. The simplicity which is enforced in\\nmusic is extended to gymnastic; Plato is aware that the training of the\\nbody may be inconsistent with the training of the mind, and that bodily\\nexercise may be easily overdone. Excessive training of the body is apt\\nto give men a headache or to render them sleepy at a lecture on\\nphilosophy, and this they attribute not to the true cause, but to the\\nnature of the subject. Two points are noticeable in Plato’s treatment\\nof gymnastic:—First, that the time of training is entirely separated\\nfrom the time of literary education. He seems to have thought that two\\nthings of an opposite and different nature could not be learnt at the\\nsame time. Here we can hardly agree with him; and, if we may judge by\\nexperience, the effect of spending three years between the ages of\\nfourteen and seventeen in mere bodily exercise would be far from\\nimproving to the intellect. Secondly, he affirms that music and\\ngymnastic are not, as common opinion is apt to imagine, intended, the\\none for the cultivation of the mind and the other of the body, but that\\nthey are both equally designed for the improvement of the mind. The\\nbody, in his view, is the servant of the mind; the subjection of the\\nlower to the higher is for the advantage of both. And doubtless the\\nmind may exercise a very great and paramount influence over the body,\\nif exerted not at particular moments and by fits and starts, but\\ncontinuously, in making preparation for the whole of life. Other Greek\\nwriters saw the mischievous tendency of Spartan discipline (Arist. Pol;\\nThuc.). But only Plato recognized the fundamental error on which the\\npractice was based.\\n\\nThe subject of gymnastic leads Plato to the sister subject of medicine,\\nwhich he further illustrates by the parallel of law. The modern\\ndisbelief in medicine has led in this, as in some other departments of\\nknowledge, to a demand for greater simplicity; physicians are becoming\\naware that they often make diseases ‘greater and more complicated’ by\\ntheir treatment of them (Rep.). In two thousand years their art has\\nmade but slender progress; what they have gained in the analysis of the\\nparts is in a great degree lost by their feebler conception of the\\nhuman frame as a whole. They have attended more to the cure of diseases\\nthan to the conditions of health; and the improvements in medicine have\\nbeen more than counterbalanced by the disuse of regular training. Until\\nlately they have hardly thought of air and water, the importance of\\nwhich was well understood by the ancients; as Aristotle remarks, ‘Air\\nand water, being the elements which we most use, have the greatest\\neffect upon health’ (Polit.). For ages physicians have been under the\\ndominion of prejudices which have only recently given way; and now\\nthere are as many opinions in medicine as in theology, and an equal\\ndegree of scepticism and some want of toleration about both. Plato has\\nseveral good notions about medicine; according to him, ‘the eye cannot\\nbe cured without the rest of the body, nor the body without the mind’\\n(Charm.). No man of sense, he says in the Timaeus, would take physic;\\nand we heartily sympathize with him in the Laws when he declares that\\n‘the limbs of the rustic worn with toil will derive more benefit from\\nwarm baths than from the prescriptions of a not over wise doctor.’ But\\nwe can hardly praise him when, in obedience to the authority of Homer,\\nhe depreciates diet, or approve of the inhuman spirit in which he would\\nget rid of invalid and useless lives by leaving them to die. He does\\nnot seem to have considered that the ‘bridle of Theages’ might be\\naccompanied by qualities which were of far more value to the State than\\nthe health or strength of the citizens; or that the duty of taking care\\nof the helpless might be an important element of education in a State.\\nThe physician himself (this is a delicate and subtle observation)\\nshould not be a man in robust health; he should have, in modern\\nphraseology, a nervous temperament; he should have experience of\\ndisease in his own person, in order that his powers of observation may\\nbe quickened in the case of others.\\n\\nThe perplexity of medicine is paralleled by the perplexity of law; in\\nwhich, again, Plato would have men follow the golden rule of\\nsimplicity. Greater matters are to be determined by the legislator or\\nby the oracle of Delphi, lesser matters are to be left to the temporary\\nregulation of the citizens themselves. Plato is aware that laissez\\nfaire is an important element of government. The diseases of a State\\nare like the heads of a hydra; they multiply when they are cut off. The\\ntrue remedy for them is not extirpation but prevention. And the way to\\nprevent them is to take care of education, and education will take care\\nof all the rest. So in modern times men have often felt that the only\\npolitical measure worth having—the only one which would produce any\\ncertain or lasting effect, was a measure of national education. And in\\nour own more than in any previous age the necessity has been recognized\\nof restoring the ever-increasing confusion of law to simplicity and\\ncommon sense.\\n\\nWhen the training in music and gymnastic is completed, there follows\\nthe first stage of active and public life. But soon education is to\\nbegin again from a new point of view. In the interval between the\\nFourth and Seventh Books we have discussed the nature of knowledge, and\\nhave thence been led to form a higher conception of what was required\\nof us. For true knowledge, according to Plato, is of abstractions, and\\nhas to do, not with particulars or individuals, but with universals\\nonly; not with the beauties of poetry, but with the ideas of\\nphilosophy. And the great aim of education is the cultivation of the\\nhabit of abstraction. This is to be acquired through the study of the\\nmathematical sciences. They alone are capable of giving ideas of\\nrelation, and of arousing the dormant energies of thought.\\n\\nMathematics in the age of Plato comprehended a very small part of that\\nwhich is now included in them; but they bore a much larger proportion\\nto the sum of human knowledge. They were the only organon of thought\\nwhich the human mind at that time possessed, and the only measure by\\nwhich the chaos of particulars could be reduced to rule and order. The\\nfaculty which they trained was naturally at war with the poetical or\\nimaginative; and hence to Plato, who is everywhere seeking for\\nabstractions and trying to get rid of the illusions of sense, nearly\\nthe whole of education is contained in them. They seemed to have an\\ninexhaustible application, partly because their true limits were not\\nyet understood. These Plato himself is beginning to investigate; though\\nnot aware that number and figure are mere abstractions of sense, he\\nrecognizes that the forms used by geometry are borrowed from the\\nsensible world. He seeks to find the ultimate ground of mathematical\\nideas in the idea of good, though he does not satisfactorily explain\\nthe connexion between them; and in his conception of the relation of\\nideas to numbers, he falls very far short of the definiteness\\nattributed to him by Aristotle (Met.). But if he fails to recognize the\\ntrue limits of mathematics, he also reaches a point beyond them; in his\\nview, ideas of number become secondary to a higher conception of\\nknowledge. The dialectician is as much above the mathematician as the\\nmathematician is above the ordinary man. The one, the self-proving, the\\ngood which is the higher sphere of dialectic, is the perfect truth to\\nwhich all things ascend, and in which they finally repose.\\n\\nThis self-proving unity or idea of good is a mere vision of which no\\ndistinct explanation can be given, relative only to a particular stage\\nin Greek philosophy. It is an abstraction under which no individuals\\nare comprehended, a whole which has no parts (Arist., Nic. Eth.). The\\nvacancy of such a form was perceived by Aristotle, but not by Plato.\\nNor did he recognize that in the dialectical process are included two\\nor more methods of investigation which are at variance with each other.\\nHe did not see that whether he took the longer or the shorter road, no\\nadvance could be made in this way. And yet such visions often have an\\nimmense effect; for although the method of science cannot anticipate\\nscience, the idea of science, not as it is, but as it will be in the\\nfuture, is a great and inspiring principle. In the pursuit of knowledge\\nwe are always pressing forward to something beyond us; and as a false\\nconception of knowledge, for example the scholastic philosophy, may\\nlead men astray during many ages, so the true ideal, though vacant, may\\ndraw all their thoughts in a right direction. It makes a great\\ndifference whether the general expectation of knowledge, as this\\nindefinite feeling may be termed, is based upon a sound judgment. For\\nmankind may often entertain a true conception of what knowledge ought\\nto be when they have but a slender experience of facts. The correlation\\nof the sciences, the consciousness of the unity of nature, the idea of\\nclassification, the sense of proportion, the unwillingness to stop\\nshort of certainty or to confound probability with truth, are important\\nprinciples of the higher education. Although Plato could tell us\\nnothing, and perhaps knew that he could tell us nothing, of the\\nabsolute truth, he has exercised an influence on the human mind which\\neven at the present day is not exhausted; and political and social\\nquestions may yet arise in which the thoughts of Plato may be read anew\\nand receive a fresh meaning.\\n\\nThe Idea of good is so called only in the Republic, but there are\\ntraces of it in other dialogues of Plato. It is a cause as well as an\\nidea, and from this point of view may be compared with the creator of\\nthe Timaeus, who out of his goodness created all things. It corresponds\\nto a certain extent with the modern conception of a law of nature, or\\nof a final cause, or of both in one, and in this regard may be\\nconnected with the measure and symmetry of the Philebus. It is\\nrepresented in the Symposium under the aspect of beauty, and is\\nsupposed to be attained there by stages of initiation, as here by\\nregular gradations of knowledge. Viewed subjectively, it is the process\\nor science of dialectic. This is the science which, according to the\\nPhaedrus, is the true basis of rhetoric, which alone is able to\\ndistinguish the natures and classes of men and things; which divides a\\nwhole into the natural parts, and reunites the scattered parts into a\\nnatural or organized whole; which defines the abstract essences or\\nuniversal ideas of all things, and connects them; which pierces the\\nveil of hypotheses and reaches the final cause or first principle of\\nall; which regards the sciences in relation to the idea of good. This\\nideal science is the highest process of thought, and may be described\\nas the soul conversing with herself or holding communion with eternal\\ntruth and beauty, and in another form is the everlasting question and\\nanswer—the ceaseless interrogative of Socrates. The dialogues of Plato\\nare themselves examples of the nature and method of dialectic. Viewed\\nobjectively, the idea of good is a power or cause which makes the world\\nwithout us correspond with the world within. Yet this world without us\\nis still a world of ideas. With Plato the investigation of nature is\\nanother department of knowledge, and in this he seeks to attain only\\nprobable conclusions (Timaeus).\\n\\nIf we ask whether this science of dialectic which Plato only half\\nexplains to us is more akin to logic or to metaphysics, the answer is\\nthat in his mind the two sciences are not as yet distinguished, any\\nmore than the subjective and objective aspects of the world and of man,\\nwhich German philosophy has revealed to us. Nor has he determined\\nwhether his science of dialectic is at rest or in motion, concerned\\nwith the contemplation of absolute being, or with a process of\\ndevelopment and evolution. Modern metaphysics may be described as the\\nscience of abstractions, or as the science of the evolution of thought;\\nmodern logic, when passing beyond the bounds of mere Aristotelian\\nforms, may be defined as the science of method. The germ of both of\\nthem is contained in the Platonic dialectic; all metaphysicians have\\nsomething in common with the ideas of Plato; all logicians have derived\\nsomething from the method of Plato. The nearest approach in modern\\nphilosophy to the universal science of Plato, is to be found in the\\nHegelian ‘succession of moments in the unity of the idea.’ Plato and\\nHegel alike seem to have conceived the world as the correlation of\\nabstractions; and not impossibly they would have understood one another\\nbetter than any of their commentators understand them (Swift’s Voyage\\nto Laputa. ‘Having a desire to see those ancients who were most\\nrenowned for wit and learning, I set apart one day on purpose. I\\nproposed that Homer and Aristotle might appear at the head of all their\\ncommentators; but these were so numerous that some hundreds were forced\\nto attend in the court and outward rooms of the palace. I knew, and\\ncould distinguish these two heroes, at first sight, not only from the\\ncrowd, but from each other. Homer was the taller and comelier person of\\nthe two, walked very erect for one of his age, and his eyes were the\\nmost quick and piercing I ever beheld. Aristotle stooped much, and made\\nuse of a staff. His visage was meagre, his hair lank and thin, and his\\nvoice hollow. I soon discovered that both of them were perfect\\nstrangers to the rest of the company, and had never seen or heard of\\nthem before. And I had a whisper from a ghost, who shall be nameless,\\n“That these commentators always kept in the most distant quarters from\\ntheir principals, in the lower world, through a consciousness of shame\\nand guilt, because they had so horribly misrepresented the meaning of\\nthese authors to posterity.” I introduced Didymus and Eustathius to\\nHomer, and prevailed on him to treat them better than perhaps they\\ndeserved, for he soon found they wanted a genius to enter into the\\nspirit of a poet. But Aristotle was out of all patience with the\\naccount I gave him of Scotus and Ramus, as I presented them to him; and\\nhe asked them “whether the rest of the tribe were as great dunces as\\nthemselves?”’). There is, however, a difference between them: for\\nwhereas Hegel is thinking of all the minds of men as one mind, which\\ndevelopes the stages of the idea in different countries or at different\\ntimes in the same country, with Plato these gradations are regarded\\nonly as an order of thought or ideas; the history of the human mind had\\nnot yet dawned upon him.\\n\\nMany criticisms may be made on Plato’s theory of education. While in\\nsome respects he unavoidably falls short of modern thinkers, in others\\nhe is in advance of them. He is opposed to the modes of education which\\nprevailed in his own time; but he can hardly be said to have discovered\\nnew ones. He does not see that education is relative to the characters\\nof individuals; he only desires to impress the same form of the state\\non the minds of all. He has no sufficient idea of the effect of\\nliterature on the formation of the mind, and greatly exaggerates that\\nof mathematics. His aim is above all things to train the reasoning\\nfaculties; to implant in the mind the spirit and power of abstraction;\\nto explain and define general notions, and, if possible, to connect\\nthem. No wonder that in the vacancy of actual knowledge his followers,\\nand at times even he himself, should have fallen away from the doctrine\\nof ideas, and have returned to that branch of knowledge in which alone\\nthe relation of the one and many can be truly seen—the science of\\nnumber. In his views both of teaching and training he might be styled,\\nin modern language, a doctrinaire; after the Spartan fashion he would\\nhave his citizens cast in one mould; he does not seem to consider that\\nsome degree of freedom, ‘a little wholesome neglect,’ is necessary to\\nstrengthen and develope the character and to give play to the\\nindividual nature. His citizens would not have acquired that knowledge\\nwhich in the vision of Er is supposed to be gained by the pilgrims from\\ntheir experience of evil.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Plato is far in advance of modern philosophers and\\ntheologians when he teaches that education is to be continued through\\nlife and will begin again in another. He would never allow education of\\nsome kind to cease; although he was aware that the proverbial saying of\\nSolon, ‘I grow old learning many things,’ cannot be applied literally.\\nHimself ravished with the contemplation of the idea of good, and\\ndelighting in solid geometry (Rep.), he has no difficulty in imagining\\nthat a lifetime might be passed happily in such pursuits. We who know\\nhow many more men of business there are in the world than real students\\nor thinkers, are not equally sanguine. The education which he proposes\\nfor his citizens is really the ideal life of the philosopher or man of\\ngenius, interrupted, but only for a time, by practical duties,—a life\\nnot for the many, but for the few.\\n\\nYet the thought of Plato may not be wholly incapable of application to\\nour own times. Even if regarded as an ideal which can never be\\nrealized, it may have a great effect in elevating the characters of\\nmankind, and raising them above the routine of their ordinary\\noccupation or profession. It is the best form under which we can\\nconceive the whole of life. Nevertheless the idea of Plato is not\\neasily put into practice. For the education of after life is\\nnecessarily the education which each one gives himself. Men and women\\ncannot be brought together in schools or colleges at forty or fifty\\nyears of age; and if they could the result would be disappointing. The\\ndestination of most men is what Plato would call ‘the Den’ for the\\nwhole of life, and with that they are content. Neither have they\\nteachers or advisers with whom they can take counsel in riper years.\\nThere is no ‘schoolmaster abroad’ who will tell them of their faults,\\nor inspire them with the higher sense of duty, or with the ambition of\\na true success in life; no Socrates who will convict them of ignorance;\\nno Christ, or follower of Christ, who will reprove them of sin. Hence\\nthey have a difficulty in receiving the first element of improvement,\\nwhich is self-knowledge. The hopes of youth no longer stir them; they\\nrather wish to rest than to pursue high objects. A few only who have\\ncome across great men and women, or eminent teachers of religion and\\nmorality, have received a second life from them, and have lighted a\\ncandle from the fire of their genius.\\n\\nThe want of energy is one of the main reasons why so few persons\\ncontinue to improve in later years. They have not the will, and do not\\nknow the way. They ‘never try an experiment,’ or look up a point of\\ninterest for themselves; they make no sacrifices for the sake of\\nknowledge; their minds, like their bodies, at a certain age become\\nfixed. Genius has been defined as ‘the power of taking pains’; but\\nhardly any one keeps up his interest in knowledge throughout a whole\\nlife. The troubles of a family, the business of making money, the\\ndemands of a profession destroy the elasticity of the mind. The waxen\\ntablet of the memory which was once capable of receiving ‘true thoughts\\nand clear impressions’ becomes hard and crowded; there is not room for\\nthe accumulations of a long life (Theaet.). The student, as years\\nadvance, rather makes an exchange of knowledge than adds to his stores.\\nThere is no pressing necessity to learn; the stock of Classics or\\nHistory or Natural Science which was enough for a man at twenty-five is\\nenough for him at fifty. Neither is it easy to give a definite answer\\nto any one who asks how he is to improve. For self-education consists\\nin a thousand things, commonplace in themselves,—in adding to what we\\nare by nature something of what we are not; in learning to see\\nourselves as others see us; in judging, not by opinion, but by the\\nevidence of facts; in seeking out the society of superior minds; in a\\nstudy of lives and writings of great men; in observation of the world\\nand character; in receiving kindly the natural influence of different\\ntimes of life; in any act or thought which is raised above the practice\\nor opinions of mankind; in the pursuit of some new or original enquiry;\\nin any effort of mind which calls forth some latent power.\\n\\nIf any one is desirous of carrying out in detail the Platonic education\\nof after-life, some such counsels as the following may be offered to\\nhim:—That he shall choose the branch of knowledge to which his own mind\\nmost distinctly inclines, and in which he takes the greatest delight,\\neither one which seems to connect with his own daily employment, or,\\nperhaps, furnishes the greatest contrast to it. He may study from the\\nspeculative side the profession or business in which he is practically\\nengaged. He may make Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Plato, Bacon the\\nfriends and companions of his life. He may find opportunities of\\nhearing the living voice of a great teacher. He may select for enquiry\\nsome point of history or some unexplained phenomenon of nature. An hour\\na day passed in such scientific or literary pursuits will furnish as\\nmany facts as the memory can retain, and will give him ‘a pleasure not\\nto be repented of’ (Timaeus). Only let him beware of being the slave of\\ncrotchets, or of running after a Will o’ the Wisp in his ignorance, or\\nin his vanity of attributing to himself the gifts of a poet or assuming\\nthe air of a philosopher. He should know the limits of his own powers.\\nBetter to build up the mind by slow additions, to creep on quietly from\\none thing to another, to gain insensibly new powers and new interests\\nin knowledge, than to form vast schemes which are never destined to be\\nrealized. But perhaps, as Plato would say, ‘This is part of another\\nsubject’ (Tim.); though we may also defend our digression by his\\nexample (Theaet.).\\n\\n4. We remark with surprise that the progress of nations or the natural\\ngrowth of institutions which fill modern treatises on political\\nphilosophy seem hardly ever to have attracted the attention of Plato\\nand Aristotle. The ancients were familiar with the mutability of human\\naffairs; they could moralize over the ruins of cities and the fall of\\nempires (Plato, Statesman, and Sulpicius’ Letter to Cicero); by them\\nfate and chance were deemed to be real powers, almost persons, and to\\nhave had a great share in political events. The wiser of them like\\nThucydides believed that ‘what had been would be again,’ and that a\\ntolerable idea of the future could be gathered from the past. Also they\\nhad dreams of a Golden Age which existed once upon a time and might\\nstill exist in some unknown land, or might return again in the remote\\nfuture. But the regular growth of a state enlightened by experience,\\nprogressing in knowledge, improving in the arts, of which the citizens\\nwere educated by the fulfilment of political duties, appears never to\\nhave come within the range of their hopes and aspirations. Such a state\\nhad never been seen, and therefore could not be conceived by them.\\nTheir experience (Aristot. Metaph.; Plato, Laws) led them to conclude\\nthat there had been cycles of civilization in which the arts had been\\ndiscovered and lost many times over, and cities had been overthrown and\\nrebuilt again and again, and deluges and volcanoes and other natural\\nconvulsions had altered the face of the earth. Tradition told them of\\nmany destructions of mankind and of the preservation of a remnant. The\\nworld began again after a deluge and was reconstructed out of the\\nfragments of itself. Also they were acquainted with empires of unknown\\nantiquity, like the Egyptian or Assyrian; but they had never seen them\\ngrow, and could not imagine, any more than we can, the state of man\\nwhich preceded them. They were puzzled and awestricken by the Egyptian\\nmonuments, of which the forms, as Plato says, not in a figure, but\\nliterally, were ten thousand years old (Laws), and they contrasted the\\nantiquity of Egypt with their own short memories.\\n\\nThe early legends of Hellas have no real connection with the later\\nhistory: they are at a distance, and the intermediate region is\\nconcealed from view; there is no road or path which leads from one to\\nthe other. At the beginning of Greek history, in the vestibule of the\\ntemple, is seen standing first of all the figure of the legislator,\\nhimself the interpreter and servant of the God. The fundamental laws\\nwhich he gives are not supposed to change with time and circumstances.\\nThe salvation of the state is held rather to depend on the inviolable\\nmaintenance of them. They were sanctioned by the authority of heaven,\\nand it was deemed impiety to alter them. The desire to maintain them\\nunaltered seems to be the origin of what at first sight is very\\nsurprising to us—the intolerant zeal of Plato against innovators in\\nreligion or politics (Laws); although with a happy inconsistency he is\\nalso willing that the laws of other countries should be studied and\\nimprovements in legislation privately communicated to the Nocturnal\\nCouncil (Laws). The additions which were made to them in later ages in\\norder to meet the increasing complexity of affairs were still ascribed\\nby a fiction to the original legislator; and the words of such\\nenactments at Athens were disputed over as if they had been the words\\nof Solon himself. Plato hopes to preserve in a later generation the\\nmind of the legislator; he would have his citizens remain within the\\nlines which he has laid down for them. He would not harass them with\\nminute regulations, he would have allowed some changes in the laws: but\\nnot changes which would affect the fundamental institutions of the\\nstate, such for example as would convert an aristocracy into a\\ntimocracy, or a timocracy into a popular form of government.\\n\\nPassing from speculations to facts, we observe that progress has been\\nthe exception rather than the law of human history. And therefore we\\nare not surprised to find that the idea of progress is of modern rather\\nthan of ancient date; and, like the idea of a philosophy of history, is\\nnot more than a century or two old. It seems to have arisen out of the\\nimpression left on the human mind by the growth of the Roman Empire and\\nof the Christian Church, and to be due to the political and social\\nimprovements which they introduced into the world; and still more in\\nour own century to the idealism of the first French Revolution and the\\ntriumph of American Independence; and in a yet greater degree to the\\nvast material prosperity and growth of population in England and her\\ncolonies and in America. It is also to be ascribed in a measure to the\\ngreater study of the philosophy of history. The optimist temperament of\\nsome great writers has assisted the creation of it, while the opposite\\ncharacter has led a few to regard the future of the world as dark. The\\n‘spectator of all time and of all existence’ sees more of ‘the\\nincreasing purpose which through the ages ran’ than formerly: but to\\nthe inhabitant of a small state of Hellas the vision was necessarily\\nlimited like the valley in which he dwelt. There was no remote past on\\nwhich his eye could rest, nor any future from which the veil was partly\\nlifted up by the analogy of history. The narrowness of view, which to\\nourselves appears so singular, was to him natural, if not unavoidable.\\n\\n5. For the relation of the Republic to the Statesman and the Laws, and\\nthe two other works of Plato which directly treat of politics, see the\\nIntroductions to the two latter; a few general points of comparison may\\nbe touched upon in this place.\\n\\nAnd first of the Laws.\\n\\n(1) The Republic, though probably written at intervals, yet speaking\\ngenerally and judging by the indications of thought and style, may be\\nreasonably ascribed to the middle period of Plato’s life: the Laws are\\ncertainly the work of his declining years, and some portions of them at\\nany rate seem to have been written in extreme old age.\\n\\n(2) The Republic is full of hope and aspiration: the Laws bear the\\nstamp of failure and disappointment. The one is a finished work which\\nreceived the last touches of the author: the other is imperfectly\\nexecuted, and apparently unfinished. The one has the grace and beauty\\nof youth: the other has lost the poetical form, but has more of the\\nseverity and knowledge of life which is characteristic of old age.\\n\\n(3) The most conspicuous defect of the Laws is the failure of dramatic\\npower, whereas the Republic is full of striking contrasts of ideas and\\noppositions of character.\\n\\n(4) The Laws may be said to have more the nature of a sermon, the\\nRepublic of a poem; the one is more religious, the other more\\nintellectual.\\n\\n(5) Many theories of Plato, such as the doctrine of ideas, the\\ngovernment of the world by philosophers, are not found in the Laws; the\\nimmortality of the soul is first mentioned in xii; the person of\\nSocrates has altogether disappeared. The community of women and\\nchildren is renounced; the institution of common or public meals for\\nwomen (Laws) is for the first time introduced (Ar. Pol.).\\n\\n(6) There remains in the Laws the old enmity to the poets, who are\\nironically saluted in high-flown terms, and, at the same time, are\\nperemptorily ordered out of the city, if they are not willing to submit\\ntheir poems to the censorship of the magistrates (Rep.).\\n\\n(7) Though the work is in most respects inferior, there are a few\\npassages in the Laws, such as the honour due to the soul, the evils of\\nlicentious or unnatural love, the whole of Book x. (religion), the\\ndishonesty of retail trade, and bequests, which come more home to us,\\nand contain more of what may be termed the modern element in Plato than\\nalmost anything in the Republic.\\n\\nThe relation of the two works to one another is very well given:\\n\\n(1) by Aristotle in the Politics from the side of the Laws:—\\n\\n‘The same, or nearly the same, objections apply to Plato’s later work,\\nthe Laws, and therefore we had better examine briefly the constitution\\nwhich is therein described. In the Republic, Socrates has definitely\\nsettled in all a few questions only; such as the community of women and\\nchildren, the community of property, and the constitution of the state.\\nThe population is divided into two classes—one of husbandmen, and the\\nother of warriors; from this latter is taken a third class of\\ncounsellors and rulers of the state. But Socrates has not determined\\nwhether the husbandmen and artists are to have a share in the\\ngovernment, and whether they too are to carry arms and share in\\nmilitary service or not. He certainly thinks that the women ought to\\nshare in the education of the guardians, and to fight by their side.\\nThe remainder of the work is filled up with digressions foreign to the\\nmain subject, and with discussions about the education of the\\nguardians. In the Laws there is hardly anything but laws; not much is\\nsaid about the constitution. This, which he had intended to make more\\nof the ordinary type, he gradually brings round to the other or ideal\\nform. For with the exception of the community of women and property, he\\nsupposes everything to be the same in both states; there is to be the\\nsame education; the citizens of both are to live free from servile\\noccupations, and there are to be common meals in both. The only\\ndifference is that in the Laws the common meals are extended to women,\\nand the warriors number about 5000, but in the Republic only 1000.’\\n\\n(2) by Plato in the Laws (Book v.), from the side of the Republic:—\\n\\n‘The first and highest form of the state and of the government and of\\nthe law is that in which there prevails most widely the ancient saying\\nthat “Friends have all things in common.” Whether there is now, or ever\\nwill be, this communion of women and children and of property, in which\\nthe private and individual is altogether banished from life, and things\\nwhich are by nature private, such as eyes and ears and hands, have\\nbecome common, and all men express praise and blame, and feel joy and\\nsorrow, on the same occasions, and the laws unite the city to the\\nutmost,—whether all this is possible or not, I say that no man, acting\\nupon any other principle, will ever constitute a state more exalted in\\nvirtue, or truer or better than this. Such a state, whether inhabited\\nby Gods or sons of Gods, will make them blessed who dwell therein; and\\ntherefore to this we are to look for the pattern of the state, and to\\ncling to this, and, as far as possible, to seek for one which is like\\nthis. The state which we have now in hand, when created, will be\\nnearest to immortality and unity in the next degree; and after that, by\\nthe grace of God, we will complete the third one. And we will begin by\\nspeaking of the nature and origin of the second.’\\n\\nThe comparatively short work called the Statesman or Politicus in its\\nstyle and manner is more akin to the Laws, while in its idealism it\\nrather resembles the Republic. As far as we can judge by various\\nindications of language and thought, it must be later than the one and\\nof course earlier than the other. In both the Republic and Statesman a\\nclose connection is maintained between Politics and Dialectic. In the\\nStatesman, enquiries into the principles of Method are interspersed\\nwith discussions about Politics. The comparative advantages of the rule\\nof law and of a person are considered, and the decision given in favour\\nof a person (Arist. Pol.). But much may be said on the other side, nor\\nis the opposition necessary; for a person may rule by law, and law may\\nbe so applied as to be the living voice of the legislator. As in the\\nRepublic, there is a myth, describing, however, not a future, but a\\nformer existence of mankind. The question is asked, ‘Whether the state\\nof innocence which is described in the myth, or a state like our own\\nwhich possesses art and science and distinguishes good from evil, is\\nthe preferable condition of man.’ To this question of the comparative\\nhappiness of civilized and primitive life, which was so often discussed\\nin the last century and in our own, no answer is given. The Statesman,\\nthough less perfect in style than the Republic and of far less range,\\nmay justly be regarded as one of the greatest of Plato’s dialogues.\\n\\n6. Others as well as Plato have chosen an ideal Republic to be the\\nvehicle of thoughts which they could not definitely express, or which\\nwent beyond their own age. The classical writing which approaches most\\nnearly to the Republic of Plato is the ‘De Republica’ of Cicero; but\\nneither in this nor in any other of his dialogues does he rival the art\\nof Plato. The manners are clumsy and inferior; the hand of the\\nrhetorician is apparent at every turn. Yet noble sentiments are\\nconstantly recurring: the true note of Roman patriotism—‘We Romans are\\na great people’—resounds through the whole work. Like Socrates, Cicero\\nturns away from the phenomena of the heavens to civil and political\\nlife. He would rather not discuss the ‘two Suns’ of which all Rome was\\ntalking, when he can converse about ‘the two nations in one’ which had\\ndivided Rome ever since the days of the Gracchi. Like Socrates again,\\nspeaking in the person of Scipio, he is afraid lest he should assume\\ntoo much the character of a teacher, rather than of an equal who is\\ndiscussing among friends the two sides of a question. He would confine\\nthe terms King or State to the rule of reason and justice, and he will\\nnot concede that title either to a democracy or to a monarchy. But\\nunder the rule of reason and justice he is willing to include the\\nnatural superior ruling over the natural inferior, which he compares to\\nthe soul ruling over the body. He prefers a mixture of forms of\\ngovernment to any single one. The two portraits of the just and the\\nunjust, which occur in the second book of the Republic, are transferred\\nto the state—Philus, one of the interlocutors, maintaining against his\\nwill the necessity of injustice as a principle of government, while the\\nother, Laelius, supports the opposite thesis. His views of language and\\nnumber are derived from Plato; like him he denounces the drama. He also\\ndeclares that if his life were to be twice as long he would have no\\ntime to read the lyric poets. The picture of democracy is translated by\\nhim word for word, though he had hardly shown himself able to ‘carry\\nthe jest’ of Plato. He converts into a stately sentence the humorous\\nfancy about the animals, who ‘are so imbued with the spirit of\\ndemocracy that they make the passers-by get out of their way.’ His\\ndescription of the tyrant is imitated from Plato, but is far inferior.\\nThe second book is historical, and claims for the Roman constitution\\n(which is to him the ideal) a foundation of fact such as Plato probably\\nintended to have given to the Republic in the Critias. His most\\nremarkable imitation of Plato is the adaptation of the vision of Er,\\nwhich is converted by Cicero into the ‘Somnium Scipionis’; he has\\n‘romanized’ the myth of the Republic, adding an argument for the\\nimmortality of the soul taken from the Phaedrus, and some other touches\\nderived from the Phaedo and the Timaeus. Though a beautiful tale and\\ncontaining splendid passages, the ‘Somnium Scipionis; is very inferior\\nto the vision of Er; it is only a dream, and hardly allows the reader\\nto suppose that the writer believes in his own creation. Whether his\\ndialogues were framed on the model of the lost dialogues of Aristotle,\\nas he himself tells us, or of Plato, to which they bear many\\nsuperficial resemblances, he is still the Roman orator; he is not\\nconversing, but making speeches, and is never able to mould the\\nintractable Latin to the grace and ease of the Greek Platonic dialogue.\\nBut if he is defective in form, much more is he inferior to the Greek\\nin matter; he nowhere in his philosophical writings leaves upon our\\nminds the impression of an original thinker.\\n\\nPlato’s Republic has been said to be a church and not a state; and such\\nan ideal of a city in the heavens has always hovered over the Christian\\nworld, and is embodied in St. Augustine’s ‘De Civitate Dei,’ which is\\nsuggested by the decay and fall of the Roman Empire, much in the same\\nmanner in which we may imagine the Republic of Plato to have been\\ninfluenced by the decline of Greek politics in the writer’s own age.\\nThe difference is that in the time of Plato the degeneracy, though\\ncertain, was gradual and insensible: whereas the taking of Rome by the\\nGoths stirred like an earthquake the age of St. Augustine. Men were\\ninclined to believe that the overthrow of the city was to be ascribed\\nto the anger felt by the old Roman deities at the neglect of their\\nworship. St. Augustine maintains the opposite thesis; he argues that\\nthe destruction of the Roman Empire is due, not to the rise of\\nChristianity, but to the vices of Paganism. He wanders over Roman\\nhistory, and over Greek philosophy and mythology, and finds everywhere\\ncrime, impiety and falsehood. He compares the worst parts of the\\nGentile religions with the best elements of the faith of Christ. He\\nshows nothing of the spirit which led others of the early Christian\\nFathers to recognize in the writings of the Greek philosophers the\\npower of the divine truth. He traces the parallel of the kingdom of\\nGod, that is, the history of the Jews, contained in their scriptures,\\nand of the kingdoms of the world, which are found in gentile writers,\\nand pursues them both into an ideal future. It need hardly be remarked\\nthat his use both of Greek and of Roman historians and of the sacred\\nwritings of the Jews is wholly uncritical. The heathen mythology, the\\nSybilline oracles, the myths of Plato, the dreams of Neo-Platonists are\\nequally regarded by him as matter of fact. He must be acknowledged to\\nbe a strictly polemical or controversial writer who makes the best of\\neverything on one side and the worst of everything on the other. He has\\nno sympathy with the old Roman life as Plato has with Greek life, nor\\nhas he any idea of the ecclesiastical kingdom which was to arise out of\\nthe ruins of the Roman empire. He is not blind to the defects of the\\nChristian Church, and looks forward to a time when Christian and Pagan\\nshall be alike brought before the judgment-seat, and the true City of\\nGod shall appear...The work of St. Augustine is a curious repertory of\\nantiquarian learning and quotations, deeply penetrated with Christian\\nethics, but showing little power of reasoning, and a slender knowledge\\nof the Greek literature and language. He was a great genius, and a\\nnoble character, yet hardly capable of feeling or understanding\\nanything external to his own theology. Of all the ancient philosophers\\nhe is most attracted by Plato, though he is very slightly acquainted\\nwith his writings. He is inclined to believe that the idea of creation\\nin the Timaeus is derived from the narrative in Genesis; and he is\\nstrangely taken with the coincidence (?) of Plato’s saying that ‘the\\nphilosopher is the lover of God,’ and the words of the Book of Exodus\\nin which God reveals himself to Moses (Exod.) He dwells at length on\\nmiracles performed in his own day, of which the evidence is regarded by\\nhim as irresistible. He speaks in a very interesting manner of the\\nbeauty and utility of nature and of the human frame, which he conceives\\nto afford a foretaste of the heavenly state and of the resurrection of\\nthe body. The book is not really what to most persons the title of it\\nwould imply, and belongs to an age which has passed away. But it\\ncontains many fine passages and thoughts which are for all time.\\n\\nThe short treatise de Monarchia of Dante is by far the most remarkable\\nof mediaeval ideals, and bears the impress of the great genius in whom\\nItaly and the Middle Ages are so vividly reflected. It is the vision of\\nan Universal Empire, which is supposed to be the natural and necessary\\ngovernment of the world, having a divine authority distinct from the\\nPapacy, yet coextensive with it. It is not ‘the ghost of the dead Roman\\nEmpire sitting crowned upon the grave thereof,’ but the legitimate heir\\nand successor of it, justified by the ancient virtues of the Romans and\\nthe beneficence of their rule. Their right to be the governors of the\\nworld is also confirmed by the testimony of miracles, and acknowledged\\nby St. Paul when he appealed to Caesar, and even more emphatically by\\nChrist Himself, Who could not have made atonement for the sins of men\\nif He had not been condemned by a divinely authorized tribunal. The\\nnecessity for the establishment of an Universal Empire is proved partly\\nby a priori arguments such as the unity of God and the unity of the\\nfamily or nation; partly by perversions of Scripture and history, by\\nfalse analogies of nature, by misapplied quotations from the classics,\\nand by odd scraps and commonplaces of logic, showing a familiar but by\\nno means exact knowledge of Aristotle (of Plato there is none). But a\\nmore convincing argument still is the miserable state of the world,\\nwhich he touchingly describes. He sees no hope of happiness or peace\\nfor mankind until all nations of the earth are comprehended in a single\\nempire. The whole treatise shows how deeply the idea of the Roman\\nEmpire was fixed in the minds of his contemporaries. Not much argument\\nwas needed to maintain the truth of a theory which to his own\\ncontemporaries seemed so natural and congenial. He speaks, or rather\\npreaches, from the point of view, not of the ecclesiastic, but of the\\nlayman, although, as a good Catholic, he is willing to acknowledge that\\nin certain respects the Empire must submit to the Church. The beginning\\nand end of all his noble reflections and of his arguments, good and\\nbad, is the aspiration ‘that in this little plot of earth belonging to\\nmortal man life may pass in freedom and peace.’ So inextricably is his\\nvision of the future bound up with the beliefs and circumstances of his\\nown age.\\n\\nThe ‘Utopia’ of Sir Thomas More is a surprising monument of his genius,\\nand shows a reach of thought far beyond his contemporaries. The book\\nwas written by him at the age of about 34 or 35, and is full of the\\ngenerous sentiments of youth. He brings the light of Plato to bear upon\\nthe miserable state of his own country. Living not long after the Wars\\nof the Roses, and in the dregs of the Catholic Church in England, he is\\nindignant at the corruption of the clergy, at the luxury of the\\nnobility and gentry, at the sufferings of the poor, at the calamities\\ncaused by war. To the eye of More the whole world was in dissolution\\nand decay; and side by side with the misery and oppression which he has\\ndescribed in the First Book of the Utopia, he places in the Second Book\\nthe ideal state which by the help of Plato he had constructed. The\\ntimes were full of stir and intellectual interest. The distant murmur\\nof the Reformation was beginning to be heard. To minds like More’s,\\nGreek literature was a revelation: there had arisen an art of\\ninterpretation, and the New Testament was beginning to be understood as\\nit had never been before, and has not often been since, in its natural\\nsense. The life there depicted appeared to him wholly unlike that of\\nChristian commonwealths, in which ‘he saw nothing but a certain\\nconspiracy of rich men procuring their own commodities under the name\\nand title of the Commonwealth.’ He thought that Christ, like Plato,\\n‘instituted all things common,’ for which reason, he tells us, the\\ncitizens of Utopia were the more willing to receive his doctrines\\n(‘Howbeit, I think this was no small help and furtherance in the\\nmatter, that they heard us say that Christ instituted among his, all\\nthings common, and that the same community doth yet remain in the\\nrightest Christian communities’ (Utopia).). The community of property\\nis a fixed idea with him, though he is aware of the arguments which may\\nbe urged on the other side (‘These things (I say), when I consider with\\nmyself, I hold well with Plato, and do nothing marvel that he would\\nmake no laws for them that refused those laws, whereby all men should\\nhave and enjoy equal portions of riches and commodities. For the wise\\nmen did easily foresee this to be the one and only way to the wealth of\\na community, if equality of all things should be brought in and\\nestablished’ (Utopia).). We wonder how in the reign of Henry VIII,\\nthough veiled in another language and published in a foreign country,\\nsuch speculations could have been endured.\\n\\nHe is gifted with far greater dramatic invention than any one who\\nsucceeded him, with the exception of Swift. In the art of feigning he\\nis a worthy disciple of Plato. Like him, starting from a small portion\\nof fact, he founds his tale with admirable skill on a few lines in the\\nLatin narrative of the voyages of Amerigo Vespucci. He is very precise\\nabout dates and facts, and has the power of making us believe that the\\nnarrator of the tale must have been an eyewitness. We are fairly\\npuzzled by his manner of mixing up real and imaginary persons; his boy\\nJohn Clement and Peter Giles, citizen of Antwerp, with whom he disputes\\nabout the precise words which are supposed to have been used by the\\n(imaginary) Portuguese traveller, Raphael Hythloday. ‘I have the more\\ncause,’ says Hythloday, ‘to fear that my words shall not be believed,\\nfor that I know how difficultly and hardly I myself would have believed\\nanother man telling the same, if I had not myself seen it with mine own\\neyes.’ Or again: ‘If you had been with me in Utopia, and had presently\\nseen their fashions and laws as I did which lived there five years and\\nmore, and would never have come thence, but only to make the new land\\nknown here,’ etc. More greatly regrets that he forgot to ask Hythloday\\nin what part of the world Utopia is situated; he ‘would have spent no\\nsmall sum of money rather than it should have escaped him,’ and he begs\\nPeter Giles to see Hythloday or write to him and obtain an answer to\\nthe question. After this we are not surprised to hear that a Professor\\nof Divinity (perhaps ‘a late famous vicar of Croydon in Surrey,’ as the\\ntranslator thinks) is desirous of being sent thither as a missionary by\\nthe High Bishop, ‘yea, and that he may himself be made Bishop of\\nUtopia, nothing doubting that he must obtain this Bishopric with suit;\\nand he counteth that a godly suit which proceedeth not of the desire of\\nhonour or lucre, but only of a godly zeal.’ The design may have failed\\nthrough the disappearance of Hythloday, concerning whom we have ‘very\\nuncertain news’ after his departure. There is no doubt, however, that\\nhe had told More and Giles the exact situation of the island, but\\nunfortunately at the same moment More’s attention, as he is reminded in\\na letter from Giles, was drawn off by a servant, and one of the company\\nfrom a cold caught on shipboard coughed so loud as to prevent Giles\\nfrom hearing. And ‘the secret has perished’ with him; to this day the\\nplace of Utopia remains unknown.\\n\\nThe words of Phaedrus, ‘O Socrates, you can easily invent Egyptians or\\nanything,’ are recalled to our mind as we read this lifelike fiction.\\nYet the greater merit of the work is not the admirable art, but the\\noriginality of thought. More is as free as Plato from the prejudices of\\nhis age, and far more tolerant. The Utopians do not allow him who\\nbelieves not in the immortality of the soul to share in the\\nadministration of the state (Laws), ‘howbeit they put him to no\\npunishment, because they be persuaded that it is in no man’s power to\\nbelieve what he list’; and ‘no man is to be blamed for reasoning in\\nsupport of his own religion (‘One of our company in my presence was\\nsharply punished. He, as soon as he was baptised, began, against our\\nwills, with more earnest affection than wisdom, to reason of Christ’s\\nreligion, and began to wax so hot in his matter, that he did not only\\nprefer our religion before all other, but also did despise and condemn\\nall other, calling them profane, and the followers of them wicked and\\ndevilish, and the children of everlasting damnation. When he had thus\\nlong reasoned the matter, they laid hold on him, accused him, and\\ncondemned him into exile, not as a despiser of religion, but as a\\nseditious person and a raiser up of dissension among the people’).’ In\\nthe public services ‘no prayers be used, but such as every man may\\nboldly pronounce without giving offence to any sect.’ He says\\nsignificantly, ‘There be that give worship to a man that was once of\\nexcellent virtue or of famous glory, not only as God, but also the\\nchiefest and highest God. But the most and the wisest part, rejecting\\nall these, believe that there is a certain godly power unknown, far\\nabove the capacity and reach of man’s wit, dispersed throughout all the\\nworld, not in bigness, but in virtue and power. Him they call the\\nFather of all. To Him alone they attribute the beginnings, the\\nincreasings, the proceedings, the changes, and the ends of all things.\\nNeither give they any divine honours to any other than him.’ So far was\\nMore from sharing the popular beliefs of his time. Yet at the end he\\nreminds us that he does not in all respects agree with the customs and\\nopinions of the Utopians which he describes. And we should let him have\\nthe benefit of this saving clause, and not rudely withdraw the veil\\nbehind which he has been pleased to conceal himself.\\n\\nNor is he less in advance of popular opinion in his political and moral\\nspeculations. He would like to bring military glory into contempt; he\\nwould set all sorts of idle people to profitable occupation, including\\nin the same class, priests, women, noblemen, gentlemen, and ‘sturdy and\\nvaliant beggars,’ that the labour of all may be reduced to six hours a\\nday. His dislike of capital punishment, and plans for the reformation\\nof offenders; his detestation of priests and lawyers (Compare his\\nsatirical observation: ‘They (the Utopians) have priests of exceeding\\nholiness, and therefore very few.); his remark that ‘although every one\\nmay hear of ravenous dogs and wolves and cruel man-eaters, it is not\\neasy to find states that are well and wisely governed,’ are curiously\\nat variance with the notions of his age and indeed with his own life.\\nThere are many points in which he shows a modern feeling and a\\nprophetic insight like Plato. He is a sanitary reformer; he maintains\\nthat civilized states have a right to the soil of waste countries; he\\nis inclined to the opinion which places happiness in virtuous\\npleasures, but herein, as he thinks, not disagreeing from those other\\nphilosophers who define virtue to be a life according to nature. He\\nextends the idea of happiness so as to include the happiness of others;\\nand he argues ingeniously, ‘All men agree that we ought to make others\\nhappy; but if others, how much more ourselves!’ And still he thinks\\nthat there may be a more excellent way, but to this no man’s reason can\\nattain unless heaven should inspire him with a higher truth. His\\nceremonies before marriage; his humane proposal that war should be\\ncarried on by assassinating the leaders of the enemy, may be compared\\nto some of the paradoxes of Plato. He has a charming fancy, like the\\naffinities of Greeks and barbarians in the Timaeus, that the Utopians\\nlearnt the language of the Greeks with the more readiness because they\\nwere originally of the same race with them. He is penetrated with the\\nspirit of Plato, and quotes or adapts many thoughts both from the\\nRepublic and from the Timaeus. He prefers public duties to private, and\\nis somewhat impatient of the importunity of relations. His citizens\\nhave no silver or gold of their own, but are ready enough to pay them\\nto their mercenaries. There is nothing of which he is more contemptuous\\nthan the love of money. Gold is used for fetters of criminals, and\\ndiamonds and pearls for children’s necklaces (When the ambassadors came\\narrayed in gold and peacocks’ feathers ‘to the eyes of all the Utopians\\nexcept very few, which had been in other countries for some reasonable\\ncause, all that gorgeousness of apparel seemed shameful and\\nreproachful. In so much that they most reverently saluted the vilest\\nand most abject of them for lords—passing over the ambassadors\\nthemselves without any honour, judging them by their wearing of golden\\nchains to be bondmen. You should have seen children also, that had cast\\naway their pearls and precious stones, when they saw the like sticking\\nupon the ambassadors’ caps, dig and push their mothers under the sides,\\nsaying thus to them—“Look, though he were a little child still.” But\\nthe mother; yea and that also in good earnest: “Peace, son,” saith she,\\n“I think he be some of the ambassadors’ fools.”’)\\n\\nLike Plato he is full of satirical reflections on governments and\\nprinces; on the state of the world and of knowledge. The hero of his\\ndiscourse (Hythloday) is very unwilling to become a minister of state,\\nconsidering that he would lose his independence and his advice would\\nnever be heeded (Compare an exquisite passage, of which the conclusion\\nis as follows: ‘And verily it is naturally given...suppressed and\\nended.’) He ridicules the new logic of his time; the Utopians could\\nnever be made to understand the doctrine of Second Intentions (‘For\\nthey have not devised one of all those rules of restrictions,\\namplifications, and suppositions, very wittily invented in the small\\nLogicals, which here our children in every place do learn. Furthermore,\\nthey were never yet able to find out the second intentions; insomuch\\nthat none of them all could ever see man himself in common, as they\\ncall him, though he be (as you know) bigger than was ever any giant,\\nyea, and pointed to of us even with our finger.’) He is very severe on\\nthe sports of the gentry; the Utopians count ‘hunting the lowest, the\\nvilest, and the most abject part of butchery.’ He quotes the words of\\nthe Republic in which the philosopher is described ‘standing out of the\\nway under a wall until the driving storm of sleet and rain be\\noverpast,’ which admit of a singular application to More’s own fate;\\nalthough, writing twenty years before (about the year 1514), he can\\nhardly be supposed to have foreseen this. There is no touch of satire\\nwhich strikes deeper than his quiet remark that the greater part of the\\nprecepts of Christ are more at variance with the lives of ordinary\\nChristians than the discourse of Utopia (‘And yet the most part of them\\nis more dissident from the manners of the world now a days, than my\\ncommunication was. But preachers, sly and wily men, following your\\ncounsel (as I suppose) because they saw men evil-willing to frame their\\nmanners to Christ’s rule, they have wrested and wried his doctrine,\\nand, like a rule of lead, have applied it to men’s manners, that by\\nsome means at the least way, they might agree together.’)\\n\\nThe ‘New Atlantis’ is only a fragment, and far inferior in merit to the\\n‘Utopia.’ The work is full of ingenuity, but wanting in creative fancy,\\nand by no means impresses the reader with a sense of credibility. In\\nsome places Lord Bacon is characteristically different from Sir Thomas\\nMore, as, for example, in the external state which he attributes to the\\ngovernor of Solomon’s House, whose dress he minutely describes, while\\nto Sir Thomas More such trappings appear simple ridiculous. Yet, after\\nthis programme of dress, Bacon adds the beautiful trait, ‘that he had a\\nlook as though he pitied men.’ Several things are borrowed by him from\\nthe Timaeus; but he has injured the unity of style by adding thoughts\\nand passages which are taken from the Hebrew Scriptures.\\n\\nThe ‘City of the Sun’ written by Campanella (1568-1639), a Dominican\\nfriar, several years after the ‘New Atlantis’ of Bacon, has many\\nresemblances to the Republic of Plato. The citizens have wives and\\nchildren in common; their marriages are of the same temporary sort, and\\nare arranged by the magistrates from time to time. They do not,\\nhowever, adopt his system of lots, but bring together the best natures,\\nmale and female, ‘according to philosophical rules.’ The infants until\\ntwo years of age are brought up by their mothers in public temples; and\\nsince individuals for the most part educate their children badly, at\\nthe beginning of their third year they are committed to the care of the\\nState, and are taught at first, not out of books, but from paintings of\\nall kinds, which are emblazoned on the walls of the city. The city has\\nsix interior circuits of walls, and an outer wall which is the seventh.\\nOn this outer wall are painted the figures of legislators and\\nphilosophers, and on each of the interior walls the symbols or forms of\\nsome one of the sciences are delineated. The women are, for the most\\npart, trained, like the men, in warlike and other exercises; but they\\nhave two special occupations of their own. After a battle, they and the\\nboys soothe and relieve the wounded warriors; also they encourage them\\nwith embraces and pleasant words. Some elements of the Christian or\\nCatholic religion are preserved among them. The life of the Apostles is\\ngreatly admired by this people because they had all things in common;\\nand the short prayer which Jesus Christ taught men is used in their\\nworship. It is a duty of the chief magistrates to pardon sins, and\\ntherefore the whole people make secret confession of them to the\\nmagistrates, and they to their chief, who is a sort of Rector\\nMetaphysicus; and by this means he is well informed of all that is\\ngoing on in the minds of men. After confession, absolution is granted\\nto the citizens collectively, but no one is mentioned by name. There\\nalso exists among them a practice of perpetual prayer, performed by a\\nsuccession of priests, who change every hour. Their religion is a\\nworship of God in Trinity, that is of Wisdom, Love and Power, but\\nwithout any distinction of persons. They behold in the sun the\\nreflection of His glory; mere graven images they reject, refusing to\\nfall under the ‘tyranny’ of idolatry.\\n\\nMany details are given about their customs of eating and drinking,\\nabout their mode of dressing, their employments, their wars. Campanella\\nlooks forward to a new mode of education, which is to be a study of\\nnature, and not of Aristotle. He would not have his citizens waste\\ntheir time in the consideration of what he calls ‘the dead signs of\\nthings.’ He remarks that he who knows one science only, does not really\\nknow that one any more than the rest, and insists strongly on the\\nnecessity of a variety of knowledge. More scholars are turned out in\\nthe City of the Sun in one year than by contemporary methods in ten or\\nfifteen. He evidently believes, like Bacon, that henceforward natural\\nscience will play a great part in education, a hope which seems hardly\\nto have been realized, either in our own or in any former age; at any\\nrate the fulfilment of it has been long deferred.\\n\\nThere is a good deal of ingenuity and even originality in this work,\\nand a most enlightened spirit pervades it. But it has little or no\\ncharm of style, and falls very far short of the ‘New Atlantis’ of\\nBacon, and still more of the ‘Utopia’ of Sir Thomas More. It is full of\\ninconsistencies, and though borrowed from Plato, shows but a\\nsuperficial acquaintance with his writings. It is a work such as one\\nmight expect to have been written by a philosopher and man of genius\\nwho was also a friar, and who had spent twenty-seven years of his life\\nin a prison of the Inquisition. The most interesting feature of the\\nbook, common to Plato and Sir Thomas More, is the deep feeling which is\\nshown by the writer, of the misery and ignorance prevailing among the\\nlower classes in his own time. Campanella takes note of Aristotle’s\\nanswer to Plato’s community of property, that in a society where all\\nthings are common, no individual would have any motive to work (Arist.\\nPol.): he replies, that his citizens being happy and contented in\\nthemselves (they are required to work only four hours a day), will have\\ngreater regard for their fellows than exists among men at present. He\\nthinks, like Plato, that if he abolishes private feelings and\\ninterests, a great public feeling will take their place.\\n\\nOther writings on ideal states, such as the ‘Oceana’ of Harrington, in\\nwhich the Lord Archon, meaning Cromwell, is described, not as he was,\\nbut as he ought to have been; or the ‘Argenis’ of Barclay, which is an\\nhistorical allegory of his own time, are too unlike Plato to be worth\\nmentioning. More interesting than either of these, and far more\\nPlatonic in style and thought, is Sir John Eliot’s ‘Monarchy of Man,’\\nin which the prisoner of the Tower, no longer able ‘to be a politician\\nin the land of his birth,’ turns away from politics to view ‘that other\\ncity which is within him,’ and finds on the very threshold of the grave\\nthat the secret of human happiness is the mastery of self. The change\\nof government in the time of the English Commonwealth set men thinking\\nabout first principles, and gave rise to many works of this class...The\\ngreat original genius of Swift owes nothing to Plato; nor is there any\\ntrace in the conversation or in the works of Dr. Johnson of any\\nacquaintance with his writings. He probably would have refuted Plato\\nwithout reading him, in the same fashion in which he supposed himself\\nto have refuted Bishop Berkeley’s theory of the non-existence of\\nmatter. If we except the so-called English Platonists, or rather\\nNeo-Platonists, who never understood their master, and the writings of\\nColeridge, who was to some extent a kindred spirit, Plato has left no\\npermanent impression on English literature.\\n\\n7. Human life and conduct are affected by ideals in the same way that\\nthey are affected by the examples of eminent men. Neither the one nor\\nthe other are immediately applicable to practice, but there is a virtue\\nflowing from them which tends to raise individuals above the common\\nroutine of society or trade, and to elevate States above the mere\\ninterests of commerce or the necessities of self-defence. Like the\\nideals of art they are partly framed by the omission of particulars;\\nthey require to be viewed at a certain distance, and are apt to fade\\naway if we attempt to approach them. They gain an imaginary\\ndistinctness when embodied in a State or in a system of philosophy, but\\nthey still remain the visions of ‘a world unrealized.’ More striking\\nand obvious to the ordinary mind are the examples of great men, who\\nhave served their own generation and are remembered in another. Even in\\nour own family circle there may have been some one, a woman, or even a\\nchild, in whose face has shone forth a goodness more than human. The\\nideal then approaches nearer to us, and we fondly cling to it. The\\nideal of the past, whether of our own past lives or of former states of\\nsociety, has a singular fascination for the minds of many. Too late we\\nlearn that such ideals cannot be recalled, though the recollection of\\nthem may have a humanizing influence on other times. But the\\nabstractions of philosophy are to most persons cold and vacant; they\\ngive light without warmth; they are like the full moon in the heavens\\nwhen there are no stars appearing. Men cannot live by thought alone;\\nthe world of sense is always breaking in upon them. They are for the\\nmost part confined to a corner of earth, and see but a little way\\nbeyond their own home or place of abode; they ‘do not lift up their\\neyes to the hills’; they are not awake when the dawn appears. But in\\nPlato we have reached a height from which a man may look into the\\ndistance and behold the future of the world and of philosophy. The\\nideal of the State and of the life of the philosopher; the ideal of an\\neducation continuing through life and extending equally to both sexes;\\nthe ideal of the unity and correlation of knowledge; the faith in good\\nand immortality—are the vacant forms of light on which Plato is seeking\\nto fix the eye of mankind.\\n\\n8. Two other ideals, which never appeared above the horizon in Greek\\nPhilosophy, float before the minds of men in our own day: one seen more\\nclearly than formerly, as though each year and each generation brought\\nus nearer to some great change; the other almost in the same degree\\nretiring from view behind the laws of nature, as if oppressed by them,\\nbut still remaining a silent hope of we know not what hidden in the\\nheart of man. The first ideal is the future of the human race in this\\nworld; the second the future of the individual in another. The first is\\nthe more perfect realization of our own present life; the second, the\\nabnegation of it: the one, limited by experience, the other,\\ntranscending it. Both of them have been and are powerful motives of\\naction; there are a few in whom they have taken the place of all\\nearthly interests. The hope of a future for the human race at first\\nsight seems to be the more disinterested, the hope of individual\\nexistence the more egotistical, of the two motives. But when men have\\nlearned to resolve their hope of a future either for themselves or for\\nthe world into the will of God—‘not my will but Thine,’ the difference\\nbetween them falls away; and they may be allowed to make either of them\\nthe basis of their lives, according to their own individual character\\nor temperament. There is as much faith in the willingness to work for\\nan unseen future in this world as in another. Neither is it\\ninconceivable that some rare nature may feel his duty to another\\ngeneration, or to another century, almost as strongly as to his own, or\\nthat living always in the presence of God, he may realize another world\\nas vividly as he does this.\\n\\nThe greatest of all ideals may, or rather must be conceived by us under\\nsimilitudes derived from human qualities; although sometimes, like the\\nJewish prophets, we may dash away these figures of speech and describe\\nthe nature of God only in negatives. These again by degrees acquire a\\npositive meaning. It would be well, if when meditating on the higher\\ntruths either of philosophy or religion, we sometimes substituted one\\nform of expression for another, lest through the necessities of\\nlanguage we should become the slaves of mere words.\\n\\nThere is a third ideal, not the same, but akin to these, which has a\\nplace in the home and heart of every believer in the religion of\\nChrist, and in which men seem to find a nearer and more familiar truth,\\nthe Divine man, the Son of Man, the Saviour of mankind, Who is the\\nfirst-born and head of the whole family in heaven and earth, in Whom\\nthe Divine and human, that which is without and that which is within\\nthe range of our earthly faculties, are indissolubly united. Neither is\\nthis divine form of goodness wholly separable from the ideal of the\\nChristian Church, which is said in the New Testament to be ‘His body,’\\nor at variance with those other images of good which Plato sets before\\nus. We see Him in a figure only, and of figures of speech we select but\\na few, and those the simplest, to be the expression of Him. We behold\\nHim in a picture, but He is not there. We gather up the fragments of\\nHis discourses, but neither do they represent Him as He truly was. His\\ndwelling is neither in heaven nor earth, but in the heart of man. This\\nis that image which Plato saw dimly in the distance, which, when\\nexisting among men, he called, in the language of Homer, ‘the likeness\\nof God,’ the likeness of a nature which in all ages men have felt to be\\ngreater and better than themselves, and which in endless forms, whether\\nderived from Scripture or nature, from the witness of history or from\\nthe human heart, regarded as a person or not as a person, with or\\nwithout parts or passions, existing in space or not in space, is and\\nwill always continue to be to mankind the Idea of Good.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n THE REPUBLIC.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE.\\n\\n\\nSocrates, who is the narrator.\\n\\nGlaucon.\\n\\nAdeimantus.\\n\\nPolemarchus.\\n\\nCephalus.\\n\\nThrasymachus.\\n\\nCleitophon.\\n\\nAnd others who are mute auditors.\\n\\nThe scene is laid in the house of Cephalus at the Piraeus; and the\\nwhole dialogue is narrated by Socrates the day after it actually took\\nplace to Timaeus, Hermocrates, Critias, and a nameless person, who are\\nintroduced in the Timaeus.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n BOOK I.\\n\\n\\nI went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston,\\nthat I might offer up my prayers to the goddess (Bendis, the Thracian\\nArtemis.); and also because I wanted to see in what manner they would\\ncelebrate the festival, which was a new thing. I was delighted with the\\nprocession of the inhabitants; but that of the Thracians was equally,\\nif not more, beautiful. When we had finished our prayers and viewed the\\nspectacle, we turned in the direction of the city; and at that instant\\nPolemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a\\ndistance as we were starting on our way home, and told his servant to\\nrun and bid us wait for him. The servant took hold of me by the cloak\\nbehind, and said: Polemarchus desires you to wait.\\n\\nI turned round, and asked him where his master was.\\n\\nThere he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only wait.\\n\\nCertainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes Polemarchus\\nappeared, and with him Adeimantus, Glaucon’s brother, Niceratus the son\\nof Nicias, and several others who had been at the procession.\\n\\nPolemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and your\\ncompanion are already on your way to the city.\\n\\nYou are not far wrong, I said.\\n\\nBut do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nAnd are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to\\nremain where you are.\\n\\nMay there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade you to\\nlet us go?\\n\\nBut can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he said.\\n\\nCertainly not, replied Glaucon.\\n\\nThen we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.\\n\\nAdeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback in\\nhonour of the goddess which will take place in the evening?\\n\\nWith horses! I replied: That is a novelty. Will horsemen carry torches\\nand pass them one to another during the race?\\n\\nYes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will be\\ncelebrated at night, which you certainly ought to see. Let us rise soon\\nafter supper and see this festival; there will be a gathering of young\\nmen, and we will have a good talk. Stay then, and do not be perverse.\\n\\nGlaucon said: I suppose, since you insist, that we must.\\n\\nVery good, I replied.\\n\\nAccordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house; and there we found\\nhis brothers Lysias and Euthydemus, and with them Thrasymachus the\\nChalcedonian, Charmantides the Paeanian, and Cleitophon the son of\\nAristonymus. There too was Cephalus the father of Polemarchus, whom I\\nhad not seen for a long time, and I thought him very much aged. He was\\nseated on a cushioned chair, and had a garland on his head, for he had\\nbeen sacrificing in the court; and there were some other chairs in the\\nroom arranged in a semicircle, upon which we sat down by him. He\\nsaluted me eagerly, and then he said:—\\n\\nYou don’t come to see me, Socrates, as often as you ought: If I were\\nstill able to go and see you I would not ask you to come to me. But at\\nmy age I can hardly get to the city, and therefore you should come\\noftener to the Piraeus. For let me tell you, that the more the\\npleasures of the body fade away, the greater to me is the pleasure and\\ncharm of conversation. Do not then deny my request, but make our house\\nyour resort and keep company with these young men; we are old friends,\\nand you will be quite at home with us.\\n\\nI replied: There is nothing which for my part I like better, Cephalus,\\nthan conversing with aged men; for I regard them as travellers who have\\ngone a journey which I too may have to go, and of whom I ought to\\nenquire, whether the way is smooth and easy, or rugged and difficult.\\nAnd this is a question which I should like to ask of you who have\\narrived at that time which the poets call the ‘threshold of old age’—Is\\nlife harder towards the end, or what report do you give of it?\\n\\nI will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is. Men of my\\nage flock together; we are birds of a feather, as the old proverb says;\\nand at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is—I cannot\\neat, I cannot drink; the pleasures of youth and love are fled away:\\nthere was a good time once, but now that is gone, and life is no longer\\nlife. Some complain of the slights which are put upon them by\\nrelations, and they will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age\\nis the cause. But to me, Socrates, these complainers seem to blame that\\nwhich is not really in fault. For if old age were the cause, I too\\nbeing old, and every other old man, would have felt as they do. But\\nthis is not my own experience, nor that of others whom I have known.\\nHow well I remember the aged poet Sophocles, when in answer to the\\nquestion, How does love suit with age, Sophocles,—are you still the man\\nyou were? Peace, he replied; most gladly have I escaped the thing of\\nwhich you speak; I feel as if I had escaped from a mad and furious\\nmaster. His words have often occurred to my mind since, and they seem\\nas good to me now as at the time when he uttered them. For certainly\\nold age has a great sense of calm and freedom; when the passions relax\\ntheir hold, then, as Sophocles says, we are freed from the grasp not of\\none mad master only, but of many. The truth is, Socrates, that these\\nregrets, and also the complaints about relations, are to be attributed\\nto the same cause, which is not old age, but men’s characters and\\ntempers; for he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the\\npressure of age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and\\nage are equally a burden.\\n\\nI listened in admiration, and wanting to draw him out, that he might go\\non—Yes, Cephalus, I said: but I rather suspect that people in general\\nare not convinced by you when you speak thus; they think that old age\\nsits lightly upon you, not because of your happy disposition, but\\nbecause you are rich, and wealth is well known to be a great comforter.\\n\\nYou are right, he replied; they are not convinced: and there is\\nsomething in what they say; not, however, so much as they imagine. I\\nmight answer them as Themistocles answered the Seriphian who was\\nabusing him and saying that he was famous, not for his own merits but\\nbecause he was an Athenian: ‘If you had been a native of my country or\\nI of yours, neither of us would have been famous.’ And to those who are\\nnot rich and are impatient of old age, the same reply may be made; for\\nto the good poor man old age cannot be a light burden, nor can a bad\\nrich man ever have peace with himself.\\n\\nMay I ask, Cephalus, whether your fortune was for the most part\\ninherited or acquired by you?\\n\\nAcquired! Socrates; do you want to know how much I acquired? In the art\\nof making money I have been midway between my father and grandfather:\\nfor my grandfather, whose name I bear, doubled and trebled the value of\\nhis patrimony, that which he inherited being much what I possess now;\\nbut my father Lysanias reduced the property below what it is at\\npresent: and I shall be satisfied if I leave to these my sons not less\\nbut a little more than I received.\\n\\nThat was why I asked you the question, I replied, because I see that\\nyou are indifferent about money, which is a characteristic rather of\\nthose who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired\\nthem; the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation\\nof their own, resembling the affection of authors for their own poems,\\nor of parents for their children, besides that natural love of it for\\nthe sake of use and profit which is common to them and all men. And\\nhence they are very bad company, for they can talk about nothing but\\nthe praises of wealth.\\n\\nThat is true, he said.\\n\\nYes, that is very true, but may I ask another question?—What do you\\nconsider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your\\nwealth?\\n\\nOne, he said, of which I could not expect easily to convince others.\\nFor let me tell you, Socrates, that when a man thinks himself to be\\nnear death, fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had\\nbefore; the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted\\nthere of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him, but now he\\nis tormented with the thought that they may be true: either from the\\nweakness of age, or because he is now drawing nearer to that other\\nplace, he has a clearer view of these things; suspicions and alarms\\ncrowd thickly upon him, and he begins to reflect and consider what\\nwrongs he has done to others. And when he finds that the sum of his\\ntransgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up in\\nhis sleep for fear, and he is filled with dark forebodings. But to him\\nwho is conscious of no sin, sweet hope, as Pindar charmingly says, is\\nthe kind nurse of his age:\\n\\n‘Hope,’ he says, ‘cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice and\\nholiness, and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his\\njourney;—hope which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man.’\\n\\nHow admirable are his words! And the great blessing of riches, I do not\\nsay to every man, but to a good man, is, that he has had no occasion to\\ndeceive or to defraud others, either intentionally or unintentionally;\\nand when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension\\nabout offerings due to the gods or debts which he owes to men. Now to\\nthis peace of mind the possession of wealth greatly contributes; and\\ntherefore I say, that, setting one thing against another, of the many\\nadvantages which wealth has to give, to a man of sense this is in my\\nopinion the greatest.\\n\\nWell said, Cephalus, I replied; but as concerning justice, what is\\nit?—to speak the truth and to pay your debts—no more than this? And\\neven to this are there not exceptions? Suppose that a friend when in\\nhis right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he\\nis not in his right mind, ought I to give them back to him? No one\\nwould say that I ought or that I should be right in doing so, any more\\nthan they would say that I ought always to speak the truth to one who\\nis in his condition.\\n\\nYou are quite right, he replied.\\n\\nBut then, I said, speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a\\ncorrect definition of justice.\\n\\nQuite correct, Socrates, if Simonides is to be believed, said\\nPolemarchus interposing.\\n\\nI fear, said Cephalus, that I must go now, for I have to look after the\\nsacrifices, and I hand over the argument to Polemarchus and the\\ncompany.\\n\\nIs not Polemarchus your heir? I said.\\n\\nTo be sure, he answered, and went away laughing to the sacrifices.\\n\\nTell me then, O thou heir of the argument, what did Simonides say, and\\naccording to you truly say, about justice?\\n\\nHe said that the repayment of a debt is just, and in saying so he\\nappears to me to be right.\\n\\nI should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired man,\\nbut his meaning, though probably clear to you, is the reverse of clear\\nto me. For he certainly does not mean, as we were just now saying, that\\nI ought to return a deposit of arms or of anything else to one who asks\\nfor it when he is not in his right senses; and yet a deposit cannot be\\ndenied to be a debt.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThen when the person who asks me is not in his right mind I am by no\\nmeans to make the return?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nWhen Simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice, he did\\nnot mean to include that case?\\n\\nCertainly not; for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good to a\\nfriend and never evil.\\n\\nYou mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury of\\nthe receiver, if the two parties are friends, is not the repayment of a\\ndebt,—that is what you would imagine him to say?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?\\n\\nTo be sure, he said, they are to receive what we owe them, and an\\nenemy, as I take it, owes to an enemy that which is due or proper to\\nhim—that is to say, evil.\\n\\nSimonides, then, after the manner of poets, would seem to have spoken\\ndarkly of the nature of justice; for he really meant to say that\\njustice is the giving to each man what is proper to him, and this he\\ntermed a debt.\\n\\nThat must have been his meaning, he said.\\n\\nBy heaven! I replied; and if we asked him what due or proper thing is\\ngiven by medicine, and to whom, what answer do you think that he would\\nmake to us?\\n\\nHe would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink to\\nhuman bodies.\\n\\nAnd what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?\\n\\nSeasoning to food.\\n\\nAnd what is that which justice gives, and to whom?\\n\\nIf, Socrates, we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the\\npreceding instances, then justice is the art which gives good to\\nfriends and evil to enemies.\\n\\nThat is his meaning then?\\n\\nI think so.\\n\\nAnd who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies\\nin time of sickness?\\n\\nThe physician.\\n\\nOr when they are on a voyage, amid the perils of the sea?\\n\\nThe pilot.\\n\\nAnd in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just\\nman most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friend?\\n\\nIn going to war against the one and in making alliances with the other.\\n\\nBut when a man is well, my dear Polemarchus, there is no need of a\\nphysician?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nAnd he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nThen in time of peace justice will be of no use?\\n\\nI am very far from thinking so.\\n\\nYou think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nLike husbandry for the acquisition of corn?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nOr like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes,—that is what you mean?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of\\npeace?\\n\\nIn contracts, Socrates, justice is of use.\\n\\nAnd by contracts you mean partnerships?\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nBut is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better\\npartner at a game of draughts?\\n\\nThe skilful player.\\n\\nAnd in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful or\\nbetter partner than the builder?\\n\\nQuite the reverse.\\n\\nThen in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than\\nthe harp-player, as in playing the harp the harp-player is certainly a\\nbetter partner than the just man?\\n\\nIn a money partnership.\\n\\nYes, Polemarchus, but surely not in the use of money; for you do not\\nwant a just man to be your counsellor in the purchase or sale of a\\nhorse; a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that,\\nwould he not?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would be\\nbetter?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThen what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man is\\nto be preferred?\\n\\nWhen you want a deposit to be kept safely.\\n\\nYou mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie?\\n\\nPrecisely.\\n\\nThat is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?\\n\\nThat is the inference.\\n\\nAnd when you want to keep a pruning-hook safe, then justice is useful\\nto the individual and to the state; but when you want to use it, then\\nthe art of the vine-dresser?\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nAnd when you want to keep a shield or a lyre, and not to use them, you\\nwould say that justice is useful; but when you want to use them, then\\nthe art of the soldier or of the musician?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd so of all other things;—justice is useful when they are useless,\\nand useless when they are useful?\\n\\nThat is the inference.\\n\\nThen justice is not good for much. But let us consider this further\\npoint: Is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in any\\nkind of fighting best able to ward off a blow?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is\\nbest able to create one?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a march\\nupon the enemy?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThen he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief?\\n\\nThat, I suppose, is to be inferred.\\n\\nThen if the just man is good at keeping money, he is good at stealing\\nit.\\n\\nThat is implied in the argument.\\n\\nThen after all the just man has turned out to be a thief. And this is a\\nlesson which I suspect you must have learnt out of Homer; for he,\\nspeaking of Autolycus, the maternal grandfather of Odysseus, who is a\\nfavourite of his, affirms that\\n\\n‘He was excellent above all men in theft and perjury.’\\n\\nAnd so, you and Homer and Simonides are agreed that justice is an art\\nof theft; to be practised however ‘for the good of friends and for the\\nharm of enemies,’—that was what you were saying?\\n\\nNo, certainly not that, though I do not now know what I did say; but I\\nstill stand by the latter words.\\n\\nWell, there is another question: By friends and enemies do we mean\\nthose who are so really, or only in seeming?\\n\\nSurely, he said, a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks\\ngood, and to hate those whom he thinks evil.\\n\\nYes, but do not persons often err about good and evil: many who are not\\ngood seem to be so, and conversely?\\n\\nThat is true.\\n\\nThen to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their\\nfriends? True.\\n\\nAnd in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil\\nto the good?\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nBut the good are just and would not do an injustice?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThen according to your argument it is just to injure those who do no\\nwrong?\\n\\nNay, Socrates; the doctrine is immoral.\\n\\nThen I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the\\nunjust?\\n\\nI like that better.\\n\\nBut see the consequence:—Many a man who is ignorant of human nature has\\nfriends who are bad friends, and in that case he ought to do harm to\\nthem; and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit; but, if so, we\\nshall be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be the\\nmeaning of Simonides.\\n\\nVery true, he said: and I think that we had better correct an error\\ninto which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words ‘friend’ and\\n‘enemy.’\\n\\nWhat was the error, Polemarchus? I asked.\\n\\nWe assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought good.\\n\\nAnd how is the error to be corrected?\\n\\nWe should rather say that he is a friend who is, as well as seems,\\ngood; and that he who seems only, and is not good, only seems to be and\\nis not a friend; and of an enemy the same may be said.\\n\\nYou would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it is just to do\\ngood to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should further say: It\\nis just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our\\nenemies when they are evil?\\n\\nYes, that appears to me to be the truth.\\n\\nBut ought the just to injure any one at all?\\n\\nUndoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his\\nenemies.\\n\\nWhen horses are injured, are they improved or deteriorated?\\n\\nThe latter.\\n\\nDeteriorated, that is to say, in the good qualities of horses, not of\\ndogs?\\n\\nYes, of horses.\\n\\nAnd dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not of\\nhorses?\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nAnd will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is the\\nproper virtue of man?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd that human virtue is justice?\\n\\nTo be sure.\\n\\nThen men who are injured are of necessity made unjust?\\n\\nThat is the result.\\n\\nBut can the musician by his art make men unmusical?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nOr the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen?\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nAnd can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking generally, can\\nthe good by virtue make them bad?\\n\\nAssuredly not.\\n\\nAny more than heat can produce cold?\\n\\nIt cannot.\\n\\nOr drought moisture?\\n\\nClearly not.\\n\\nNor can the good harm any one?\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nAnd the just is the good?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThen to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man,\\nbut of the opposite, who is the unjust?\\n\\nI think that what you say is quite true, Socrates.\\n\\nThen if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts, and\\nthat good is the debt which a just man owes to his friends, and evil\\nthe debt which he owes to his enemies,—to say this is not wise; for it\\nis not true, if, as has been clearly shown, the injuring of another can\\nbe in no case just.\\n\\nI agree with you, said Polemarchus.\\n\\nThen you and I are prepared to take up arms against any one who\\nattributes such a saying to Simonides or Bias or Pittacus, or any other\\nwise man or seer?\\n\\nI am quite ready to do battle at your side, he said.\\n\\nShall I tell you whose I believe the saying to be?\\n\\nWhose?\\n\\nI believe that Periander or Perdiccas or Xerxes or Ismenias the Theban,\\nor some other rich and mighty man, who had a great opinion of his own\\npower, was the first to say that justice is ‘doing good to your friends\\nand harm to your enemies.’\\n\\nMost true, he said.\\n\\nYes, I said; but if this definition of justice also breaks down, what\\nother can be offered?\\n\\nSeveral times in the course of the discussion Thrasymachus had made an\\nattempt to get the argument into his own hands, and had been put down\\nby the rest of the company, who wanted to hear the end. But when\\nPolemarchus and I had done speaking and there was a pause, he could no\\nlonger hold his peace; and, gathering himself up, he came at us like a\\nwild beast, seeking to devour us. We were quite panic-stricken at the\\nsight of him.\\n\\nHe roared out to the whole company: What folly, Socrates, has taken\\npossession of you all? And why, sillybillies, do you knock under to one\\nanother? I say that if you want really to know what justice is, you\\nshould not only ask but answer, and you should not seek honour to\\nyourself from the refutation of an opponent, but have your own answer;\\nfor there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer. And now I will\\nnot have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit or gain or\\ninterest, for this sort of nonsense will not do for me; I must have\\nclearness and accuracy.\\n\\nI was panic-stricken at his words, and could not look at him without\\ntrembling. Indeed I believe that if I had not fixed my eye upon him, I\\nshould have been struck dumb: but when I saw his fury rising, I looked\\nat him first, and was therefore able to reply to him.\\n\\nThrasymachus, I said, with a quiver, don’t be hard upon us. Polemarchus\\nand I may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument, but I\\ncan assure you that the error was not intentional. If we were seeking\\nfor a piece of gold, you would not imagine that we were ‘knocking under\\nto one another,’ and so losing our chance of finding it. And why, when\\nwe are seeking for justice, a thing more precious than many pieces of\\ngold, do you say that we are weakly yielding to one another and not\\ndoing our utmost to get at the truth? Nay, my good friend, we are most\\nwilling and anxious to do so, but the fact is that we cannot. And if\\nso, you people who know all things should pity us and not be angry with\\nus.\\n\\nHow characteristic of Socrates! he replied, with a bitter laugh;—that’s\\nyour ironical style! Did I not foresee—have I not already told you,\\nthat whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer, and try irony or\\nany other shuffle, in order that he might avoid answering?\\n\\nYou are a philosopher, Thrasymachus, I replied, and well know that if\\nyou ask a person what numbers make up twelve, taking care to prohibit\\nhim whom you ask from answering twice six, or three times four, or six\\ntimes two, or four times three, ‘for this sort of nonsense will not do\\nfor me,’—then obviously, if that is your way of putting the question,\\nno one can answer you. But suppose that he were to retort,\\n‘Thrasymachus, what do you mean? If one of these numbers which you\\ninterdict be the true answer to the question, am I falsely to say some\\nother number which is not the right one?—is that your meaning?’—How\\nwould you answer him?\\n\\nJust as if the two cases were at all alike! he said.\\n\\nWhy should they not be? I replied; and even if they are not, but only\\nappear to be so to the person who is asked, ought he not to say what he\\nthinks, whether you and I forbid him or not?\\n\\nI presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted\\nanswers?\\n\\nI dare say that I may, notwithstanding the danger, if upon reflection I\\napprove of any of them.\\n\\nBut what if I give you an answer about justice other and better, he\\nsaid, than any of these? What do you deserve to have done to you?\\n\\nDone to me!—as becomes the ignorant, I must learn from the wise—that is\\nwhat I deserve to have done to me.\\n\\nWhat, and no payment! a pleasant notion!\\n\\nI will pay when I have the money, I replied.\\n\\nBut you have, Socrates, said Glaucon: and you, Thrasymachus, need be\\nunder no anxiety about money, for we will all make a contribution for\\nSocrates.\\n\\nYes, he replied, and then Socrates will do as he always does—refuse to\\nanswer himself, but take and pull to pieces the answer of some one\\nelse.\\n\\nWhy, my good friend, I said, how can any one answer who knows, and says\\nthat he knows, just nothing; and who, even if he has some faint notions\\nof his own, is told by a man of authority not to utter them? The\\nnatural thing is, that the speaker should be some one like yourself who\\nprofesses to know and can tell what he knows. Will you then kindly\\nanswer, for the edification of the company and of myself?\\n\\nGlaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request, and\\nThrasymachus, as any one might see, was in reality eager to speak; for\\nhe thought that he had an excellent answer, and would distinguish\\nhimself. But at first he affected to insist on my answering; at length\\nhe consented to begin. Behold, he said, the wisdom of Socrates; he\\nrefuses to teach himself, and goes about learning of others, to whom he\\nnever even says Thank you.\\n\\nThat I learn of others, I replied, is quite true; but that I am\\nungrateful I wholly deny. Money I have none, and therefore I pay in\\npraise, which is all I have; and how ready I am to praise any one who\\nappears to me to speak well you will very soon find out when you\\nanswer; for I expect that you will answer well.\\n\\nListen, then, he said; I proclaim that justice is nothing else than the\\ninterest of the stronger. And now why do you not praise me? But of\\ncourse you won’t.\\n\\nLet me first understand you, I replied. Justice, as you say, is the\\ninterest of the stronger. What, Thrasymachus, is the meaning of this?\\nYou cannot mean to say that because Polydamas, the pancratiast, is\\nstronger than we are, and finds the eating of beef conducive to his\\nbodily strength, that to eat beef is therefore equally for our good who\\nare weaker than he is, and right and just for us?\\n\\nThat’s abominable of you, Socrates; you take the words in the sense\\nwhich is most damaging to the argument.\\n\\nNot at all, my good sir, I said; I am trying to understand them; and I\\nwish that you would be a little clearer.\\n\\nWell, he said, have you never heard that forms of government differ;\\nthere are tyrannies, and there are democracies, and there are\\naristocracies?\\n\\nYes, I know.\\n\\nAnd the government is the ruling power in each state?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd the different forms of government make laws democratical,\\naristocratical, tyrannical, with a view to their several interests; and\\nthese laws, which are made by them for their own interests, are the\\njustice which they deliver to their subjects, and him who transgresses\\nthem they punish as a breaker of the law, and unjust. And that is what\\nI mean when I say that in all states there is the same principle of\\njustice, which is the interest of the government; and as the government\\nmust be supposed to have power, the only reasonable conclusion is, that\\neverywhere there is one principle of justice, which is the interest of\\nthe stronger.\\n\\nNow I understand you, I said; and whether you are right or not I will\\ntry to discover. But let me remark, that in defining justice you have\\nyourself used the word ‘interest’ which you forbade me to use. It is\\ntrue, however, that in your definition the words ‘of the stronger’ are\\nadded.\\n\\nA small addition, you must allow, he said.\\n\\nGreat or small, never mind about that: we must first enquire whether\\nwhat you are saying is the truth. Now we are both agreed that justice\\nis interest of some sort, but you go on to say ‘of the stronger’; about\\nthis addition I am not so sure, and must therefore consider further.\\n\\nProceed.\\n\\nI will; and first tell me, Do you admit that it is just for subjects to\\nobey their rulers?\\n\\nI do.\\n\\nBut are the rulers of states absolutely infallible, or are they\\nsometimes liable to err?\\n\\nTo be sure, he replied, they are liable to err.\\n\\nThen in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly, and\\nsometimes not?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nWhen they make them rightly, they make them agreeably to their\\ninterest; when they are mistaken, contrary to their interest; you admit\\nthat?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects,—and that\\nis what you call justice?\\n\\nDoubtless.\\n\\nThen justice, according to your argument, is not only obedience to the\\ninterest of the stronger but the reverse?\\n\\nWhat is that you are saying? he asked.\\n\\nI am only repeating what you are saying, I believe. But let us\\nconsider: Have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about\\ntheir own interest in what they command, and also that to obey them is\\njustice? Has not that been admitted?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThen you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest\\nof the stronger, when the rulers unintentionally command things to be\\ndone which are to their own injury. For if, as you say, justice is the\\nobedience which the subject renders to their commands, in that case, O\\nwisest of men, is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker\\nare commanded to do, not what is for the interest, but what is for the\\ninjury of the stronger?\\n\\nNothing can be clearer, Socrates, said Polemarchus.\\n\\nYes, said Cleitophon, interposing, if you are allowed to be his\\nwitness.\\n\\nBut there is no need of any witness, said Polemarchus, for Thrasymachus\\nhimself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for\\ntheir own interest, and that for subjects to obey them is justice.\\n\\nYes, Polemarchus,—Thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what was\\ncommanded by their rulers is just.\\n\\nYes, Cleitophon, but he also said that justice is the interest of the\\nstronger, and, while admitting both these propositions, he further\\nacknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his\\nsubjects to do what is not for his own interest; whence follows that\\njustice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger.\\n\\nBut, said Cleitophon, he meant by the interest of the stronger what the\\nstronger thought to be his interest,—this was what the weaker had to\\ndo; and this was affirmed by him to be justice.\\n\\nThose were not his words, rejoined Polemarchus.\\n\\nNever mind, I replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept his\\nstatement. Tell me, Thrasymachus, I said, did you mean by justice what\\nthe stronger thought to be his interest, whether really so or not?\\n\\nCertainly not, he said. Do you suppose that I call him who is mistaken\\nthe stronger at the time when he is mistaken?\\n\\nYes, I said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted that\\nthe ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken.\\n\\nYou argue like an informer, Socrates. Do you mean, for example, that he\\nwho is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken?\\nor that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or\\ngrammarian at the time when he is making the mistake, in respect of the\\nmistake? True, we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian\\nhas made a mistake, but this is only a way of speaking; for the fact is\\nthat neither the grammarian nor any other person of skill ever makes a\\nmistake in so far as he is what his name implies; they none of them err\\nunless their skill fails them, and then they cease to be skilled\\nartists. No artist or sage or ruler errs at the time when he is what\\nhis name implies; though he is commonly said to err, and I adopted the\\ncommon mode of speaking. But to be perfectly accurate, since you are\\nsuch a lover of accuracy, we should say that the ruler, in so far as he\\nis a ruler, is unerring, and, being unerring, always commands that\\nwhich is for his own interest; and the subject is required to execute\\nhis commands; and therefore, as I said at first and now repeat, justice\\nis the interest of the stronger.\\n\\nIndeed, Thrasymachus, and do I really appear to you to argue like an\\ninformer?\\n\\nCertainly, he replied.\\n\\nAnd do you suppose that I ask these questions with any design of\\ninjuring you in the argument?\\n\\nNay, he replied, ‘suppose’ is not the word—I know it; but you will be\\nfound out, and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail.\\n\\nI shall not make the attempt, my dear man; but to avoid any\\nmisunderstanding occurring between us in future, let me ask, in what\\nsense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest, as you were\\nsaying, he being the superior, it is just that the inferior should\\nexecute—is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict sense of the\\nterm?\\n\\nIn the strictest of all senses, he said. And now cheat and play the\\ninformer if you can; I ask no quarter at your hands. But you never will\\nbe able, never.\\n\\nAnd do you imagine, I said, that I am such a madman as to try and\\ncheat, Thrasymachus? I might as well shave a lion.\\n\\nWhy, he said, you made the attempt a minute ago, and you failed.\\n\\nEnough, I said, of these civilities. It will be better that I should\\nask you a question: Is the physician, taken in that strict sense of\\nwhich you are speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of money? And\\nremember that I am now speaking of the true physician.\\n\\nA healer of the sick, he replied.\\n\\nAnd the pilot—that is to say, the true pilot—is he a captain of sailors\\nor a mere sailor?\\n\\nA captain of sailors.\\n\\nThe circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into\\naccount; neither is he to be called a sailor; the name pilot by which\\nhe is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing, but is significant\\nof his skill and of his authority over the sailors.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nNow, I said, every art has an interest?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nFor which the art has to consider and provide?\\n\\nYes, that is the aim of art.\\n\\nAnd the interest of any art is the perfection of it—this and nothing\\nelse?\\n\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nI mean what I may illustrate negatively by the example of the body.\\nSuppose you were to ask me whether the body is self-sufficing or has\\nwants, I should reply: Certainly the body has wants; for the body may\\nbe ill and require to be cured, and has therefore interests to which\\nthe art of medicine ministers; and this is the origin and intention of\\nmedicine, as you will acknowledge. Am I not right?\\n\\nQuite right, he replied.\\n\\nBut is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in any\\nquality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the\\near fail of hearing, and therefore requires another art to provide for\\nthe interests of seeing and hearing—has art in itself, I say, any\\nsimilar liability to fault or defect, and does every art require\\nanother supplementary art to provide for its interests, and that\\nanother and another without end? Or have the arts to look only after\\ntheir own interests? Or have they no need either of themselves or of\\nanother?—having no faults or defects, they have no need to correct\\nthem, either by the exercise of their own art or of any other; they\\nhave only to consider the interest of their subject-matter. For every\\nart remains pure and faultless while remaining true—that is to say,\\nwhile perfect and unimpaired. Take the words in your precise sense, and\\ntell me whether I am not right.\\n\\nYes, clearly.\\n\\nThen medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, but the\\ninterest of the body?\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nNor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art of\\nhorsemanship, but the interests of the horse; neither do any other arts\\ncare for themselves, for they have no needs; they care only for that\\nwhich is the subject of their art?\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nBut surely, Thrasymachus, the arts are the superiors and rulers of\\ntheir own subjects?\\n\\nTo this he assented with a good deal of reluctance.\\n\\nThen, I said, no science or art considers or enjoins the interest of\\nthe stronger or superior, but only the interest of the subject and\\nweaker?\\n\\nHe made an attempt to contest this proposition also, but finally\\nacquiesced.\\n\\nThen, I continued, no physician, in so far as he is a physician,\\nconsiders his own good in what he prescribes, but the good of his\\npatient; for the true physician is also a ruler having the human body\\nas a subject, and is not a mere money-maker; that has been admitted?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd the pilot likewise, in the strict sense of the term, is a ruler of\\nsailors and not a mere sailor?\\n\\nThat has been admitted.\\n\\nAnd such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest\\nof the sailor who is under him, and not for his own or the ruler’s\\ninterest?\\n\\nHe gave a reluctant ‘Yes.’\\n\\nThen, I said, Thrasymachus, there is no one in any rule who, in so far\\nas he is a ruler, considers or enjoins what is for his own interest,\\nbut always what is for the interest of his subject or suitable to his\\nart; to that he looks, and that alone he considers in everything which\\nhe says and does.\\n\\nWhen we had got to this point in the argument, and every one saw that\\nthe definition of justice had been completely upset, Thrasymachus,\\ninstead of replying to me, said: Tell me, Socrates, have you got a\\nnurse?\\n\\nWhy do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be\\nanswering?\\n\\nBecause she leaves you to snivel, and never wipes your nose: she has\\nnot even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep.\\n\\nWhat makes you say that? I replied.\\n\\nBecause you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens or tends the\\nsheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of\\nhimself or his master; and you further imagine that the rulers of\\nstates, if they are true rulers, never think of their subjects as\\nsheep, and that they are not studying their own advantage day and\\nnight. Oh, no; and so entirely astray are you in your ideas about the\\njust and unjust as not even to know that justice and the just are in\\nreality another’s good; that is to say, the interest of the ruler and\\nstronger, and the loss of the subject and servant; and injustice the\\nopposite; for the unjust is lord over the truly simple and just: he is\\nthe stronger, and his subjects do what is for his interest, and\\nminister to his happiness, which is very far from being their own.\\nConsider further, most foolish Socrates, that the just is always a\\nloser in comparison with the unjust. First of all, in private\\ncontracts: wherever the unjust is the partner of the just you will find\\nthat, when the partnership is dissolved, the unjust man has always more\\nand the just less. Secondly, in their dealings with the State: when\\nthere is an income-tax, the just man will pay more and the unjust less\\non the same amount of income; and when there is anything to be received\\nthe one gains nothing and the other much. Observe also what happens\\nwhen they take an office; there is the just man neglecting his affairs\\nand perhaps suffering other losses, and getting nothing out of the\\npublic, because he is just; moreover he is hated by his friends and\\nacquaintance for refusing to serve them in unlawful ways. But all this\\nis reversed in the case of the unjust man. I am speaking, as before, of\\ninjustice on a large scale in which the advantage of the unjust is most\\napparent; and my meaning will be most clearly seen if we turn to that\\nhighest form of injustice in which the criminal is the happiest of men,\\nand the sufferers or those who refuse to do injustice are the most\\nmiserable—that is to say tyranny, which by fraud and force takes away\\nthe property of others, not little by little but wholesale;\\ncomprehending in one, things sacred as well as profane, private and\\npublic; for which acts of wrong, if he were detected perpetrating any\\none of them singly, he would be punished and incur great disgrace—they\\nwho do such wrong in particular cases are called robbers of temples,\\nand man-stealers and burglars and swindlers and thieves. But when a man\\nbesides taking away the money of the citizens has made slaves of them,\\nthen, instead of these names of reproach, he is termed happy and\\nblessed, not only by the citizens but by all who hear of his having\\nachieved the consummation of injustice. For mankind censure injustice,\\nfearing that they may be the victims of it and not because they shrink\\nfrom committing it. And thus, as I have shown, Socrates, injustice,\\nwhen on a sufficient scale, has more strength and freedom and mastery\\nthan justice; and, as I said at first, justice is the interest of the\\nstronger, whereas injustice is a man’s own profit and interest.\\n\\nThrasymachus, when he had thus spoken, having, like a bath-man, deluged\\nour ears with his words, had a mind to go away. But the company would\\nnot let him; they insisted that he should remain and defend his\\nposition; and I myself added my own humble request that he would not\\nleave us. Thrasymachus, I said to him, excellent man, how suggestive\\nare your remarks! And are you going to run away before you have fairly\\ntaught or learned whether they are true or not? Is the attempt to\\ndetermine the way of man’s life so small a matter in your eyes—to\\ndetermine how life may be passed by each one of us to the greatest\\nadvantage?\\n\\nAnd do I differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the enquiry?\\n\\nYou appear rather, I replied, to have no care or thought about us,\\nThrasymachus—whether we live better or worse from not knowing what you\\nsay you know, is to you a matter of indifference. Prithee, friend, do\\nnot keep your knowledge to yourself; we are a large party; and any\\nbenefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded. For my own\\npart I openly declare that I am not convinced, and that I do not\\nbelieve injustice to be more gainful than justice, even if uncontrolled\\nand allowed to have free play. For, granting that there may be an\\nunjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraud or force,\\nstill this does not convince me of the superior advantage of injustice,\\nand there may be others who are in the same predicament with myself.\\nPerhaps we may be wrong; if so, you in your wisdom should convince us\\nthat we are mistaken in preferring justice to injustice.\\n\\nAnd how am I to convince you, he said, if you are not already convinced\\nby what I have just said; what more can I do for you? Would you have me\\nput the proof bodily into your souls?\\n\\nHeaven forbid! I said; I would only ask you to be consistent; or, if\\nyou change, change openly and let there be no deception. For I must\\nremark, Thrasymachus, if you will recall what was previously said, that\\nalthough you began by defining the true physician in an exact sense,\\nyou did not observe a like exactness when speaking of the shepherd; you\\nthought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends the sheep not with a view\\nto their own good, but like a mere diner or banquetter with a view to\\nthe pleasures of the table; or, again, as a trader for sale in the\\nmarket, and not as a shepherd. Yet surely the art of the shepherd is\\nconcerned only with the good of his subjects; he has only to provide\\nthe best for them, since the perfection of the art is already ensured\\nwhenever all the requirements of it are satisfied. And that was what I\\nwas saying just now about the ruler. I conceived that the art of the\\nruler, considered as ruler, whether in a state or in private life,\\ncould only regard the good of his flock or subjects; whereas you seem\\nto think that the rulers in states, that is to say, the true rulers,\\nlike being in authority.\\n\\nThink! Nay, I am sure of it.\\n\\nThen why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly\\nwithout payment, unless under the idea that they govern for the\\nadvantage not of themselves but of others? Let me ask you a question:\\nAre not the several arts different, by reason of their each having a\\nseparate function? And, my dear illustrious friend, do say what you\\nthink, that we may make a little progress.\\n\\nYes, that is the difference, he replied.\\n\\nAnd each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general\\none—medicine, for example, gives us health; navigation, safety at sea,\\nand so on?\\n\\nYes, he said.\\n\\nAnd the art of payment has the special function of giving pay: but we\\ndo not confuse this with other arts, any more than the art of the pilot\\nis to be confused with the art of medicine, because the health of the\\npilot may be improved by a sea voyage. You would not be inclined to\\nsay, would you, that navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we\\nare to adopt your exact use of language?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nOr because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not\\nsay that the art of payment is medicine?\\n\\nI should not.\\n\\nNor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a\\nman takes fees when he is engaged in healing?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nAnd we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is specially\\nconfined to the art?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThen, if there be any good which all artists have in common, that is to\\nbe attributed to something of which they all have the common use?\\n\\nTrue, he replied.\\n\\nAnd when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is\\ngained by an additional use of the art of pay, which is not the art\\nprofessed by him?\\n\\nHe gave a reluctant assent to this.\\n\\nThen the pay is not derived by the several artists from their\\nrespective arts. But the truth is, that while the art of medicine gives\\nhealth, and the art of the builder builds a house, another art attends\\nthem which is the art of pay. The various arts may be doing their own\\nbusiness and benefiting that over which they preside, but would the\\nartist receive any benefit from his art unless he were paid as well?\\n\\nI suppose not.\\n\\nBut does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing?\\n\\nCertainly, he confers a benefit.\\n\\nThen now, Thrasymachus, there is no longer any doubt that neither arts\\nnor governments provide for their own interests; but, as we were before\\nsaying, they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who\\nare the weaker and not the stronger—to their good they attend and not\\nto the good of the superior. And this is the reason, my dear\\nThrasymachus, why, as I was just now saying, no one is willing to\\ngovern; because no one likes to take in hand the reformation of evils\\nwhich are not his concern without remuneration. For, in the execution\\nof his work, and in giving his orders to another, the true artist does\\nnot regard his own interest, but always that of his subjects; and\\ntherefore in order that rulers may be willing to rule, they must be\\npaid in one of three modes of payment, money, or honour, or a penalty\\nfor refusing.\\n\\nWhat do you mean, Socrates? said Glaucon. The first two modes of\\npayment are intelligible enough, but what the penalty is I do not\\nunderstand, or how a penalty can be a payment.\\n\\nYou mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment which to\\nthe best men is the great inducement to rule? Of course you know that\\nambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd for this reason, I said, money and honour have no attraction for\\nthem; good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing\\nand so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves\\nout of the public revenues to get the name of thieves. And not being\\nambitious they do not care about honour. Wherefore necessity must be\\nlaid upon them, and they must be induced to serve from the fear of\\npunishment. And this, as I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness\\nto take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed\\ndishonourable. Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who\\nrefuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself.\\nAnd the fear of this, as I conceive, induces the good to take office,\\nnot because they would, but because they cannot help—not under the idea\\nthat they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves, but as\\na necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling\\nto any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good. For there\\nis reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men,\\nthen to avoid office would be as much an object of contention as to\\nobtain office is at present; then we should have plain proof that the\\ntrue ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest, but that\\nof his subjects; and every one who knew this would choose rather to\\nreceive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring\\none. So far am I from agreeing with Thrasymachus that justice is the\\ninterest of the stronger. This latter question need not be further\\ndiscussed at present; but when Thrasymachus says that the life of the\\nunjust is more advantageous than that of the just, his new statement\\nappears to me to be of a far more serious character. Which of us has\\nspoken truly? And which sort of life, Glaucon, do you prefer?\\n\\nI for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous, he\\nanswered.\\n\\nDid you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus was\\nrehearsing?\\n\\nYes, I heard him, he replied, but he has not convinced me.\\n\\nThen shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if we can, that\\nhe is saying what is not true?\\n\\nMost certainly, he replied.\\n\\nIf, I said, he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all\\nthe advantages of being just, and he answers and we rejoin, there must\\nbe a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed on either\\nside, and in the end we shall want judges to decide; but if we proceed\\nin our enquiry as we lately did, by making admissions to one another,\\nwe shall unite the offices of judge and advocate in our own persons.\\n\\nVery good, he said.\\n\\nAnd which method do I understand you to prefer? I said.\\n\\nThat which you propose.\\n\\nWell, then, Thrasymachus, I said, suppose you begin at the beginning\\nand answer me. You say that perfect injustice is more gainful than\\nperfect justice?\\n\\nYes, that is what I say, and I have given you my reasons.\\n\\nAnd what is your view about them? Would you call one of them virtue and\\nthe other vice?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nI suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice?\\n\\nWhat a charming notion! So likely too, seeing that I affirm injustice\\nto be profitable and justice not.\\n\\nWhat else then would you say?\\n\\nThe opposite, he replied.\\n\\nAnd would you call justice vice?\\n\\nNo, I would rather say sublime simplicity.\\n\\nThen would you call injustice malignity?\\n\\nNo; I would rather say discretion.\\n\\nAnd do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good?\\n\\nYes, he said; at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly\\nunjust, and who have the power of subduing states and nations; but\\nperhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses. Even this profession\\nif undetected has advantages, though they are not to be compared with\\nthose of which I was just now speaking.\\n\\nI do not think that I misapprehend your meaning, Thrasymachus, I\\nreplied; but still I cannot hear without amazement that you class\\ninjustice with wisdom and virtue, and justice with the opposite.\\n\\nCertainly I do so class them.\\n\\nNow, I said, you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable\\nground; for if the injustice which you were maintaining to be\\nprofitable had been admitted by you as by others to be vice and\\ndeformity, an answer might have been given to you on received\\nprinciples; but now I perceive that you will call injustice honourable\\nand strong, and to the unjust you will attribute all the qualities\\nwhich were attributed by us before to the just, seeing that you do not\\nhesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and virtue.\\n\\nYou have guessed most infallibly, he replied.\\n\\nThen I certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the\\nargument so long as I have reason to think that you, Thrasymachus, are\\nspeaking your real mind; for I do believe that you are now in earnest\\nand are not amusing yourself at our expense.\\n\\nI may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you?—to refute the\\nargument is your business.\\n\\nVery true, I said; that is what I have to do: But will you be so good\\nas answer yet one more question? Does the just man try to gain any\\nadvantage over the just?\\n\\nFar otherwise; if he did he would not be the simple amusing creature\\nwhich he is.\\n\\nAnd would he try to go beyond just action?\\n\\nHe would not.\\n\\nAnd how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the\\nunjust; would that be considered by him as just or unjust?\\n\\nHe would think it just, and would try to gain the advantage; but he\\nwould not be able.\\n\\nWhether he would or would not be able, I said, is not to the point. My\\nquestion is only whether the just man, while refusing to have more than\\nanother just man, would wish and claim to have more than the unjust?\\n\\nYes, he would.\\n\\nAnd what of the unjust—does he claim to have more than the just man and\\nto do more than is just?\\n\\nOf course, he said, for he claims to have more than all men.\\n\\nAnd the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the\\nunjust man or action, in order that he may have more than all?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nWe may put the matter thus, I said—the just does not desire more than\\nhis like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more than\\nboth his like and his unlike?\\n\\nNothing, he said, can be better than that statement.\\n\\nAnd the unjust is good and wise, and the just is neither?\\n\\nGood again, he said.\\n\\nAnd is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike them?\\n\\nOf course, he said, he who is of a certain nature, is like those who\\nare of a certain nature; he who is not, not.\\n\\nEach of them, I said, is such as his like is?\\n\\nCertainly, he replied.\\n\\nVery good, Thrasymachus, I said; and now to take the case of the arts:\\nyou would admit that one man is a musician and another not a musician?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd which is wise and which is foolish?\\n\\nClearly the musician is wise, and he who is not a musician is foolish.\\n\\nAnd he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far as he is\\nfoolish?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when he adjusts\\nthe lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the\\ntightening and loosening the strings?\\n\\nI do not think that he would.\\n\\nBut he would claim to exceed the non-musician?\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nAnd what would you say of the physician? In prescribing meats and\\ndrinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the\\npractice of medicine?\\n\\nHe would not.\\n\\nBut he would wish to go beyond the non-physician?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd about knowledge and ignorance in general; see whether you think\\nthat any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice of\\nsaying or doing more than another man who has knowledge. Would he not\\nrather say or do the same as his like in the same case?\\n\\nThat, I suppose, can hardly be denied.\\n\\nAnd what of the ignorant? would he not desire to have more than either\\nthe knowing or the ignorant?\\n\\nI dare say.\\n\\nAnd the knowing is wise?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd the wise is good?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThen the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like, but\\nmore than his unlike and opposite?\\n\\nI suppose so.\\n\\nWhereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nBut did we not say, Thrasymachus, that the unjust goes beyond both his\\nlike and unlike? Were not these your words?\\n\\nThey were.\\n\\nAnd you also said that the just will not go beyond his like but his\\nunlike?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThen the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like the evil\\nand ignorant?\\n\\nThat is the inference.\\n\\nAnd each of them is such as his like is?\\n\\nThat was admitted.\\n\\nThen the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil\\nand ignorant.\\n\\nThrasymachus made all these admissions, not fluently, as I repeat them,\\nbut with extreme reluctance; it was a hot summer’s day, and the\\nperspiration poured from him in torrents; and then I saw what I had\\nnever seen before, Thrasymachus blushing. As we were now agreed that\\njustice was virtue and wisdom, and injustice vice and ignorance, I\\nproceeded to another point:\\n\\nWell, I said, Thrasymachus, that matter is now settled; but were we not\\nalso saying that injustice had strength; do you remember?\\n\\nYes, I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of what you\\nare saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you would be\\nquite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either permit me to\\nhave my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will answer\\n‘Very good,’ as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod ‘Yes’\\nand ‘No.’\\n\\nCertainly not, I said, if contrary to your real opinion.\\n\\nYes, he said, I will, to please you, since you will not let me speak.\\nWhat else would you have?\\n\\nNothing in the world, I said; and if you are so disposed I will ask and\\nyou shall answer.\\n\\nProceed.\\n\\nThen I will repeat the question which I asked before, in order that our\\nexamination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may be\\ncarried on regularly. A statement was made that injustice is stronger\\nand more powerful than justice, but now justice, having been identified\\nwith wisdom and virtue, is easily shown to be stronger than injustice,\\nif injustice is ignorance; this can no longer be questioned by any one.\\nBut I want to view the matter, Thrasymachus, in a different way: You\\nwould not deny that a state may be unjust and may be unjustly\\nattempting to enslave other states, or may have already enslaved them,\\nand may be holding many of them in subjection?\\n\\nTrue, he replied; and I will add that the best and most perfectly\\nunjust state will be most likely to do so.\\n\\nI know, I said, that such was your position; but what I would further\\nconsider is, whether this power which is possessed by the superior\\nstate can exist or be exercised without justice or only with justice.\\n\\nIf you are right in your view, and justice is wisdom, then only with\\njustice; but if I am right, then without justice.\\n\\nI am delighted, Thrasymachus, to see you not only nodding assent and\\ndissent, but making answers which are quite excellent.\\n\\nThat is out of civility to you, he replied.\\n\\nYou are very kind, I said; and would you have the goodness also to\\ninform me, whether you think that a state, or an army, or a band of\\nrobbers and thieves, or any other gang of evil-doers could act at all\\nif they injured one another?\\n\\nNo indeed, he said, they could not.\\n\\nBut if they abstained from injuring one another, then they might act\\ntogether better?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and\\nfighting, and justice imparts harmony and friendship; is not that true,\\nThrasymachus?\\n\\nI agree, he said, because I do not wish to quarrel with you.\\n\\nHow good of you, I said; but I should like to know also whether\\ninjustice, having this tendency to arouse hatred, wherever existing,\\namong slaves or among freemen, will not make them hate one another and\\nset them at variance and render them incapable of common action?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd even if injustice be found in two only, will they not quarrel and\\nfight, and become enemies to one another and to the just?\\n\\nThey will.\\n\\nAnd suppose injustice abiding in a single person, would your wisdom say\\nthat she loses or that she retains her natural power?\\n\\nLet us assume that she retains her power.\\n\\nYet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that\\nwherever she takes up her abode, whether in a city, in an army, in a\\nfamily, or in any other body, that body is, to begin with, rendered\\nincapable of united action by reason of sedition and distraction; and\\ndoes it not become its own enemy and at variance with all that opposes\\nit, and with the just? Is not this the case?\\n\\nYes, certainly.\\n\\nAnd is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person; in\\nthe first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not at\\nunity with himself, and in the second place making him an enemy to\\nhimself and the just? Is not that true, Thrasymachus?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd O my friend, I said, surely the gods are just?\\n\\nGranted that they are.\\n\\nBut if so, the unjust will be the enemy of the gods, and the just will\\nbe their friend?\\n\\nFeast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; I will not\\noppose you, lest I should displease the company.\\n\\nWell then, proceed with your answers, and let me have the remainder of\\nmy repast. For we have already shown that the just are clearly wiser\\nand better and abler than the unjust, and that the unjust are incapable\\nof common action; nay more, that to speak as we did of men who are evil\\nacting at any time vigorously together, is not strictly true, for if\\nthey had been perfectly evil, they would have laid hands upon one\\nanother; but it is evident that there must have been some remnant of\\njustice in them, which enabled them to combine; if there had not been\\nthey would have injured one another as well as their victims; they were\\nbut half-villains in their enterprises; for had they been whole\\nvillains, and utterly unjust, they would have been utterly incapable of\\naction. That, as I believe, is the truth of the matter, and not what\\nyou said at first. But whether the just have a better and happier life\\nthan the unjust is a further question which we also proposed to\\nconsider. I think that they have, and for the reasons which I have\\ngiven; but still I should like to examine further, for no light matter\\nis at stake, nothing less than the rule of human life.\\n\\nProceed.\\n\\nI will proceed by asking a question: Would you not say that a horse has\\nsome end?\\n\\nI should.\\n\\nAnd the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could\\nnot be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?\\n\\nI do not understand, he said.\\n\\nLet me explain: Can you see, except with the eye?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nOr hear, except with the ear?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nThese then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs?\\n\\nThey may.\\n\\nBut you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a chisel, and\\nin many other ways?\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nAnd yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the purpose?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nMay we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook?\\n\\nWe may.\\n\\nThen now I think you will have no difficulty in understanding my\\nmeaning when I asked the question whether the end of anything would be\\nthat which could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by\\nany other thing?\\n\\nI understand your meaning, he said, and assent.\\n\\nAnd that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence? Need I\\nask again whether the eye has an end?\\n\\nIt has.\\n\\nAnd has not the eye an excellence?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd the ear has an end and an excellence also?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd the same is true of all other things; they have each of them an end\\nand a special excellence?\\n\\nThat is so.\\n\\nWell, and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their\\nown proper excellence and have a defect instead?\\n\\nHow can they, he said, if they are blind and cannot see?\\n\\nYou mean to say, if they have lost their proper excellence, which is\\nsight; but I have not arrived at that point yet. I would rather ask the\\nquestion more generally, and only enquire whether the things which\\nfulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence, and fail\\nof fulfilling them by their own defect?\\n\\nCertainly, he replied.\\n\\nI might say the same of the ears; when deprived of their own proper\\nexcellence they cannot fulfil their end?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd the same observation will apply to all other things?\\n\\nI agree.\\n\\nWell; and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil? for\\nexample, to superintend and command and deliberate and the like. Are\\nnot these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be\\nassigned to any other?\\n\\nTo no other.\\n\\nAnd is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul?\\n\\nAssuredly, he said.\\n\\nAnd has not the soul an excellence also?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that\\nexcellence?\\n\\nShe cannot.\\n\\nThen an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent,\\nand the good soul a good ruler?\\n\\nYes, necessarily.\\n\\nAnd we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and\\ninjustice the defect of the soul?\\n\\nThat has been admitted.\\n\\nThen the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust man\\nwill live ill?\\n\\nThat is what your argument proves.\\n\\nAnd he who lives well is blessed and happy, and he who lives ill the\\nreverse of happy?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThen the just is happy, and the unjust miserable?\\n\\nSo be it.\\n\\nBut happiness and not misery is profitable.\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nThen, my blessed Thrasymachus, injustice can never be more profitable\\nthan justice.\\n\\nLet this, Socrates, he said, be your entertainment at the Bendidea.\\n\\nFor which I am indebted to you, I said, now that you have grown gentle\\ntowards me and have left off scolding. Nevertheless, I have not been\\nwell entertained; but that was my own fault and not yours. As an\\nepicure snatches a taste of every dish which is successively brought to\\ntable, he not having allowed himself time to enjoy the one before, so\\nhave I gone from one subject to another without having discovered what\\nI sought at first, the nature of justice. I left that enquiry and\\nturned away to consider whether justice is virtue and wisdom or evil\\nand folly; and when there arose a further question about the\\ncomparative advantages of justice and injustice, I could not refrain\\nfrom passing on to that. And the result of the whole discussion has\\nbeen that I know nothing at all. For I know not what justice is, and\\ntherefore I am not likely to know whether it is or is not a virtue, nor\\ncan I say whether the just man is happy or unhappy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n BOOK II.\\n\\n\\nWith these words I was thinking that I had made an end of the\\ndiscussion; but the end, in truth, proved to be only a beginning. For\\nGlaucon, who is always the most pugnacious of men, was dissatisfied at\\nThrasymachus’ retirement; he wanted to have the battle out. So he said\\nto me: Socrates, do you wish really to persuade us, or only to seem to\\nhave persuaded us, that to be just is always better than to be unjust?\\n\\nI should wish really to persuade you, I replied, if I could.\\n\\nThen you certainly have not succeeded. Let me ask you now:—How would\\nyou arrange goods—are there not some which we welcome for their own\\nsakes, and independently of their consequences, as, for example,\\nharmless pleasures and enjoyments, which delight us at the time,\\nalthough nothing follows from them?\\n\\nI agree in thinking that there is such a class, I replied.\\n\\nIs there not also a second class of goods, such as knowledge, sight,\\nhealth, which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their\\nresults?\\n\\nCertainly, I said.\\n\\nAnd would you not recognize a third class, such as gymnastic, and the\\ncare of the sick, and the physician’s art; also the various ways of\\nmoney-making—these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable; and\\nno one would choose them for their own sakes, but only for the sake of\\nsome reward or result which flows from them?\\n\\nThere is, I said, this third class also. But why do you ask?\\n\\nBecause I want to know in which of the three classes you would place\\njustice?\\n\\nIn the highest class, I replied,—among those goods which he who would\\nbe happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their\\nresults.\\n\\nThen the many are of another mind; they think that justice is to be\\nreckoned in the troublesome class, among goods which are to be pursued\\nfor the sake of rewards and of reputation, but in themselves are\\ndisagreeable and rather to be avoided.\\n\\nI know, I said, that this is their manner of thinking, and that this\\nwas the thesis which Thrasymachus was maintaining just now, when he\\ncensured justice and praised injustice. But I am too stupid to be\\nconvinced by him.\\n\\nI wish, he said, that you would hear me as well as him, and then I\\nshall see whether you and I agree. For Thrasymachus seems to me, like a\\nsnake, to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have\\nbeen; but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet\\nbeen made clear. Setting aside their rewards and results, I want to\\nknow what they are in themselves, and how they inwardly work in the\\nsoul. If you, please, then, I will revive the argument of Thrasymachus.\\nAnd first I will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to\\nthe common view of them. Secondly, I will show that all men who\\npractise justice do so against their will, of necessity, but not as a\\ngood. And thirdly, I will argue that there is reason in this view, for\\nthe life of the unjust is after all better far than the life of the\\njust—if what they say is true, Socrates, since I myself am not of their\\nopinion. But still I acknowledge that I am perplexed when I hear the\\nvoices of Thrasymachus and myriads of others dinning in my ears; and,\\non the other hand, I have never yet heard the superiority of justice to\\ninjustice maintained by any one in a satisfactory way. I want to hear\\njustice praised in respect of itself; then I shall be satisfied, and\\nyou are the person from whom I think that I am most likely to hear\\nthis; and therefore I will praise the unjust life to the utmost of my\\npower, and my manner of speaking will indicate the manner in which I\\ndesire to hear you too praising justice and censuring injustice. Will\\nyou say whether you approve of my proposal?\\n\\nIndeed I do; nor can I imagine any theme about which a man of sense\\nwould oftener wish to converse.\\n\\nI am delighted, he replied, to hear you say so, and shall begin by\\nspeaking, as I proposed, of the nature and origin of justice.\\n\\nThey say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice,\\nevil; but that the evil is greater than the good. And so when men have\\nboth done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not\\nbeing able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they\\nhad better agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise\\nlaws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed\\nby them lawful and just. This they affirm to be the origin and nature\\nof justice;—it is a mean or compromise, between the best of all, which\\nis to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is\\nto suffer injustice without the power of retaliation; and justice,\\nbeing at a middle point between the two, is tolerated not as a good,\\nbut as the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the inability of men\\nto do injustice. For no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever\\nsubmit to such an agreement if he were able to resist; he would be mad\\nif he did. Such is the received account, Socrates, of the nature and\\norigin of justice.\\n\\nNow that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because\\nthey have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine\\nsomething of this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust\\npower to do what they will, let us watch and see whither desire will\\nlead them; then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust\\nman to be proceeding along the same road, following their interest,\\nwhich all natures deem to be their good, and are only diverted into the\\npath of justice by the force of law. The liberty which we are supposing\\nmay be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is\\nsaid to have been possessed by Gyges, the ancestor of Croesus the\\nLydian. According to the tradition, Gyges was a shepherd in the service\\nof the king of Lydia; there was a great storm, and an earthquake made\\nan opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock.\\nAmazed at the sight, he descended into the opening, where, among other\\nmarvels, he beheld a hollow brazen horse, having doors, at which he\\nstooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature, as appeared to him,\\nmore than human, and having nothing on but a gold ring; this he took\\nfrom the finger of the dead and reascended. Now the shepherds met\\ntogether, according to custom, that they might send their monthly\\nreport about the flocks to the king; into their assembly he came having\\nthe ring on his finger, and as he was sitting among them he chanced to\\nturn the collet of the ring inside his hand, when instantly he became\\ninvisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as\\nif he were no longer present. He was astonished at this, and again\\ntouching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared; he made\\nseveral trials of the ring, and always with the same result—when he\\nturned the collet inwards he became invisible, when outwards he\\nreappeared. Whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers\\nwho were sent to the court; whereas soon as he arrived he seduced the\\nqueen, and with her help conspired against the king and slew him, and\\ntook the kingdom. Suppose now that there were two such magic rings, and\\nthe just put on one of them and the unjust the other; no man can be\\nimagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in\\njustice. No man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he\\ncould safely take what he liked out of the market, or go into houses\\nand lie with any one at his pleasure, or kill or release from prison\\nwhom he would, and in all respects be like a God among men. Then the\\nactions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would\\nboth come at last to the same point. And this we may truly affirm to be\\na great proof that a man is just, not willingly or because he thinks\\nthat justice is any good to him individually, but of necessity, for\\nwherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust, there he is\\nunjust. For all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more\\nprofitable to the individual than justice, and he who argues as I have\\nbeen supposing, will say that they are right. If you could imagine any\\none obtaining this power of becoming invisible, and never doing any\\nwrong or touching what was another’s, he would be thought by the\\nlookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although they would praise him\\nto one another’s faces, and keep up appearances with one another from a\\nfear that they too might suffer injustice. Enough of this.\\n\\nNow, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and\\nunjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the\\nisolation to be effected? I answer: Let the unjust man be entirely\\nunjust, and the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away\\nfrom either of them, and both are to be perfectly furnished for the\\nwork of their respective lives. First, let the unjust be like other\\ndistinguished masters of craft; like the skilful pilot or physician,\\nwho knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits, and\\nwho, if he fails at any point, is able to recover himself. So let the\\nunjust make his unjust attempts in the right way, and lie hidden if he\\nmeans to be great in his injustice: (he who is found out is nobody:)\\nfor the highest reach of injustice is, to be deemed just when you are\\nnot. Therefore I say that in the perfectly unjust man we must assume\\nthe most perfect injustice; there is to be no deduction, but we must\\nallow him, while doing the most unjust acts, to have acquired the\\ngreatest reputation for justice. If he have taken a false step he must\\nbe able to recover himself; he must be one who can speak with effect,\\nif any of his deeds come to light, and who can force his way where\\nforce is required by his courage and strength, and command of money and\\nfriends. And at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and\\nsimplicity, wishing, as Aeschylus says, to be and not to seem good.\\nThere must be no seeming, for if he seem to be just he will be honoured\\nand rewarded, and then we shall not know whether he is just for the\\nsake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards; therefore, let\\nhim be clothed in justice only, and have no other covering; and he must\\nbe imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former. Let him be\\nthe best of men, and let him be thought the worst; then he will have\\nbeen put to the proof; and we shall see whether he will be affected by\\nthe fear of infamy and its consequences. And let him continue thus to\\nthe hour of death; being just and seeming to be unjust. When both have\\nreached the uttermost extreme, the one of justice and the other of\\ninjustice, let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the\\ntwo.\\n\\nHeavens! my dear Glaucon, I said, how energetically you polish them up\\nfor the decision, first one and then the other, as if they were two\\nstatues.\\n\\nI do my best, he said. And now that we know what they are like there is\\nno difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either of\\nthem. This I will proceed to describe; but as you may think the\\ndescription a little too coarse, I ask you to suppose, Socrates, that\\nthe words which follow are not mine.—Let me put them into the mouths of\\nthe eulogists of injustice: They will tell you that the just man who is\\nthought unjust will be scourged, racked, bound—will have his eyes burnt\\nout; and, at last, after suffering every kind of evil, he will be\\nimpaled: Then he will understand that he ought to seem only, and not to\\nbe, just; the words of Aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust\\nthan of the just. For the unjust is pursuing a reality; he does not\\nlive with a view to appearances—he wants to be really unjust and not to\\nseem only:—\\n\\n‘His mind has a soil deep and fertile, Out of which spring his prudent\\ncounsels.’\\n\\nIn the first place, he is thought just, and therefore bears rule in the\\ncity; he can marry whom he will, and give in marriage to whom he will;\\nalso he can trade and deal where he likes, and always to his own\\nadvantage, because he has no misgivings about injustice; and at every\\ncontest, whether in public or private, he gets the better of his\\nantagonists, and gains at their expense, and is rich, and out of his\\ngains he can benefit his friends, and harm his enemies; moreover, he\\ncan offer sacrifices, and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and\\nmagnificently, and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to\\nhonour in a far better style than the just, and therefore he is likely\\nto be dearer than they are to the gods. And thus, Socrates, gods and\\nmen are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the\\nlife of the just.\\n\\nI was going to say something in answer to Glaucon, when Adeimantus, his\\nbrother, interposed: Socrates, he said, you do not suppose that there\\nis nothing more to be urged?\\n\\nWhy, what else is there? I answered.\\n\\nThe strongest point of all has not been even mentioned, he replied.\\n\\nWell, then, according to the proverb, ‘Let brother help brother’—if he\\nfails in any part do you assist him; although I must confess that\\nGlaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust, and take\\nfrom me the power of helping justice.\\n\\nNonsense, he replied. But let me add something more: There is another\\nside to Glaucon’s argument about the praise and censure of justice and\\ninjustice, which is equally required in order to bring out what I\\nbelieve to be his meaning. Parents and tutors are always telling their\\nsons and their wards that they are to be just; but why? not for the\\nsake of justice, but for the sake of character and reputation; in the\\nhope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices,\\nmarriages, and the like which Glaucon has enumerated among the\\nadvantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice. More,\\nhowever, is made of appearances by this class of persons than by the\\nothers; for they throw in the good opinion of the gods, and will tell\\nyou of a shower of benefits which the heavens, as they say, rain upon\\nthe pious; and this accords with the testimony of the noble Hesiod and\\nHomer, the first of whom says, that the gods make the oaks of the just—\\n\\n ‘To bear acorns at their summit, and bees in the middle;\\nAnd the sheep are bowed down with the weight of their fleeces,’\\n\\n\\nand many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them. And\\nHomer has a very similar strain; for he speaks of one whose fame is—\\n\\n‘As the fame of some blameless king who, like a god, Maintains justice;\\nto whom the black earth brings forth Wheat and barley, whose trees are\\nbowed with fruit, And his sheep never fail to bear, and the sea gives\\nhim fish.’\\n\\nStill grander are the gifts of heaven which Musaeus and his son\\nvouchsafe to the just; they take them down into the world below, where\\nthey have the saints lying on couches at a feast, everlastingly drunk,\\ncrowned with garlands; their idea seems to be that an immortality of\\ndrunkenness is the highest meed of virtue. Some extend their rewards\\nyet further; the posterity, as they say, of the faithful and just shall\\nsurvive to the third and fourth generation. This is the style in which\\nthey praise justice. But about the wicked there is another strain; they\\nbury them in a slough in Hades, and make them carry water in a sieve;\\nalso while they are yet living they bring them to infamy, and inflict\\nupon them the punishments which Glaucon described as the portion of the\\njust who are reputed to be unjust; nothing else does their invention\\nsupply. Such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the\\nother.\\n\\nOnce more, Socrates, I will ask you to consider another way of speaking\\nabout justice and injustice, which is not confined to the poets, but is\\nfound in prose writers. The universal voice of mankind is always\\ndeclaring that justice and virtue are honourable, but grievous and\\ntoilsome; and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of\\nattainment, and are only censured by law and opinion. They say also\\nthat honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty; and\\nthey are quite ready to call wicked men happy, and to honour them both\\nin public and private when they are rich or in any other way\\ninfluential, while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and\\npoor, even though acknowledging them to be better than the others. But\\nmost extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and\\nthe gods: they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many\\ngood men, and good and happiness to the wicked. And mendicant prophets\\ngo to rich men’s doors and persuade them that they have a power\\ncommitted to them by the gods of making an atonement for a man’s own or\\nhis ancestor’s sins by sacrifices or charms, with rejoicings and\\nfeasts; and they promise to harm an enemy, whether just or unjust, at a\\nsmall cost; with magic arts and incantations binding heaven, as they\\nsay, to execute their will. And the poets are the authorities to whom\\nthey appeal, now smoothing the path of vice with the words of Hesiod;—\\n\\n‘Vice may be had in abundance without trouble; the way is smooth and\\nher dwelling-place is near. But before virtue the gods have set toil,’\\n\\nand a tedious and uphill road: then citing Homer as a witness that the\\ngods may be influenced by men; for he also says:—\\n\\n‘The gods, too, may be turned from their purpose; and men pray to them\\nand avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties, and by\\nlibations and the odour of fat, when they have sinned and\\ntransgressed.’\\n\\nAnd they produce a host of books written by Musaeus and Orpheus, who\\nwere children of the Moon and the Muses—that is what they say—according\\nto which they perform their ritual, and persuade not only individuals,\\nbut whole cities, that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by\\nsacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour, and are equally at\\nthe service of the living and the dead; the latter sort they call\\nmysteries, and they redeem us from the pains of hell, but if we neglect\\nthem no one knows what awaits us.\\n\\nHe proceeded: And now when the young hear all this said about virtue\\nand vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their\\nminds likely to be affected, my dear Socrates,—those of them, I mean,\\nwho are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower,\\nand from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what\\nmanner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if\\nthey would make the best of life? Probably the youth will say to\\nhimself in the words of Pindar—\\n\\n‘Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower\\nwhich may be a fortress to me all my days?’\\n\\nFor what men say is that, if I am really just and am not also thought\\njust profit there is none, but the pain and loss on the other hand are\\nunmistakeable. But if, though unjust, I acquire the reputation of\\njustice, a heavenly life is promised to me. Since then, as philosophers\\nprove, appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness, to\\nappearance I must devote myself. I will describe around me a picture\\nand shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my house;\\nbehind I will trail the subtle and crafty fox, as Archilochus, greatest\\nof sages, recommends. But I hear some one exclaiming that the\\nconcealment of wickedness is often difficult; to which I answer,\\nNothing great is easy. Nevertheless, the argument indicates this, if we\\nwould be happy, to be the path along which we should proceed. With a\\nview to concealment we will establish secret brotherhoods and political\\nclubs. And there are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of\\npersuading courts and assemblies; and so, partly by persuasion and\\npartly by force, I shall make unlawful gains and not be punished. Still\\nI hear a voice saying that the gods cannot be deceived, neither can\\nthey be compelled. But what if there are no gods? or, suppose them to\\nhave no care of human things—why in either case should we mind about\\nconcealment? And even if there are gods, and they do care about us, yet\\nwe know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the poets;\\nand these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced and\\nturned by ‘sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings.’ Let us\\nbe consistent then, and believe both or neither. If the poets speak\\ntruly, why then we had better be unjust, and offer of the fruits of\\ninjustice; for if we are just, although we may escape the vengeance of\\nheaven, we shall lose the gains of injustice; but, if we are unjust, we\\nshall keep the gains, and by our sinning and praying, and praying and\\nsinning, the gods will be propitiated, and we shall not be punished.\\n‘But there is a world below in which either we or our posterity will\\nsuffer for our unjust deeds.’ Yes, my friend, will be the reflection,\\nbut there are mysteries and atoning deities, and these have great\\npower. That is what mighty cities declare; and the children of the\\ngods, who were their poets and prophets, bear a like testimony.\\n\\nOn what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than\\nthe worst injustice? when, if we only unite the latter with a deceitful\\nregard to appearances, we shall fare to our mind both with gods and\\nmen, in life and after death, as the most numerous and the highest\\nauthorities tell us. Knowing all this, Socrates, how can a man who has\\nany superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth, be willing to\\nhonour justice; or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears\\njustice praised? And even if there should be some one who is able to\\ndisprove the truth of my words, and who is satisfied that justice is\\nbest, still he is not angry with the unjust, but is very ready to\\nforgive them, because he also knows that men are not just of their own\\nfree will; unless, peradventure, there be some one whom the divinity\\nwithin him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice, or who has\\nattained knowledge of the truth—but no other man. He only blames\\ninjustice who, owing to cowardice or age or some weakness, has not the\\npower of being unjust. And this is proved by the fact that when he\\nobtains the power, he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be.\\n\\nThe cause of all this, Socrates, was indicated by us at the beginning\\nof the argument, when my brother and I told you how astonished we were\\nto find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice—beginning\\nwith the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us,\\nand ending with the men of our own time—no one has ever blamed\\ninjustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories,\\nhonours, and benefits which flow from them. No one has ever adequately\\ndescribed either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either\\nof them abiding in the soul, and invisible to any human or divine eye;\\nor shown that of all the things of a man’s soul which he has within\\nhim, justice is the greatest good, and injustice the greatest evil. Had\\nthis been the universal strain, had you sought to persuade us of this\\nfrom our youth upwards, we should not have been on the watch to keep\\none another from doing wrong, but every one would have been his own\\nwatchman, because afraid, if he did wrong, of harbouring in himself the\\ngreatest of evils. I dare say that Thrasymachus and others would\\nseriously hold the language which I have been merely repeating, and\\nwords even stronger than these about justice and injustice, grossly, as\\nI conceive, perverting their true nature. But I speak in this vehement\\nmanner, as I must frankly confess to you, because I want to hear from\\nyou the opposite side; and I would ask you to show not only the\\nsuperiority which justice has over injustice, but what effect they have\\non the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other\\nan evil to him. And please, as Glaucon requested of you, to exclude\\nreputations; for unless you take away from each of them his true\\nreputation and add on the false, we shall say that you do not praise\\njustice, but the appearance of it; we shall think that you are only\\nexhorting us to keep injustice dark, and that you really agree with\\nThrasymachus in thinking that justice is another’s good and the\\ninterest of the stronger, and that injustice is a man’s own profit and\\ninterest, though injurious to the weaker. Now as you have admitted that\\njustice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed\\nfor their results, but in a far greater degree for their own sakes—like\\nsight or hearing or knowledge or health, or any other real and natural\\nand not merely conventional good—I would ask you in your praise of\\njustice to regard one point only: I mean the essential good and evil\\nwhich justice and injustice work in the possessors of them. Let others\\npraise justice and censure injustice, magnifying the rewards and\\nhonours of the one and abusing the other; that is a manner of arguing\\nwhich, coming from them, I am ready to tolerate, but from you who have\\nspent your whole life in the consideration of this question, unless I\\nhear the contrary from your own lips, I expect something better. And\\ntherefore, I say, not only prove to us that justice is better than\\ninjustice, but show what they either of them do to the possessor of\\nthem, which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil, whether\\nseen or unseen by gods and men.\\n\\nI had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus, but on\\nhearing these words I was quite delighted, and said: Sons of an\\nillustrious father, that was not a bad beginning of the Elegiac verses\\nwhich the admirer of Glaucon made in honour of you after you had\\ndistinguished yourselves at the battle of Megara:—\\n\\n‘Sons of Ariston,’ he sang, ‘divine offspring of an illustrious hero.’\\n\\nThe epithet is very appropriate, for there is something truly divine in\\nbeing able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice,\\nand remaining unconvinced by your own arguments. And I do believe that\\nyou are not convinced—this I infer from your general character, for had\\nI judged only from your speeches I should have mistrusted you. But now,\\nthe greater my confidence in you, the greater is my difficulty in\\nknowing what to say. For I am in a strait between two; on the one hand\\nI feel that I am unequal to the task; and my inability is brought home\\nto me by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which I\\nmade to Thrasymachus, proving, as I thought, the superiority which\\njustice has over injustice. And yet I cannot refuse to help, while\\nbreath and speech remain to me; I am afraid that there would be an\\nimpiety in being present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting\\nup a hand in her defence. And therefore I had best give such help as I\\ncan.\\n\\nGlaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question\\ndrop, but to proceed in the investigation. They wanted to arrive at the\\ntruth, first, about the nature of justice and injustice, and secondly,\\nabout their relative advantages. I told them, what I really thought,\\nthat the enquiry would be of a serious nature, and would require very\\ngood eyes. Seeing then, I said, that we are no great wits, I think that\\nwe had better adopt a method which I may illustrate thus; suppose that\\na short-sighted person had been asked by some one to read small letters\\nfrom a distance; and it occurred to some one else that they might be\\nfound in another place which was larger and in which the letters were\\nlarger—if they were the same and he could read the larger letters\\nfirst, and then proceed to the lesser—this would have been thought a\\nrare piece of good fortune.\\n\\nVery true, said Adeimantus; but how does the illustration apply to our\\nenquiry?\\n\\nI will tell you, I replied; justice, which is the subject of our\\nenquiry, is, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an\\nindividual, and sometimes as the virtue of a State.\\n\\nTrue, he replied.\\n\\nAnd is not a State larger than an individual?\\n\\nIt is.\\n\\nThen in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and\\nmore easily discernible. I propose therefore that we enquire into the\\nnature of justice and injustice, first as they appear in the State, and\\nsecondly in the individual, proceeding from the greater to the lesser\\nand comparing them.\\n\\nThat, he said, is an excellent proposal.\\n\\nAnd if we imagine the State in process of creation, we shall see the\\njustice and injustice of the State in process of creation also.\\n\\nI dare say.\\n\\nWhen the State is completed there may be a hope that the object of our\\nsearch will be more easily discovered.\\n\\nYes, far more easily.\\n\\nBut ought we to attempt to construct one? I said; for to do so, as I am\\ninclined to think, will be a very serious task. Reflect therefore.\\n\\nI have reflected, said Adeimantus, and am anxious that you should\\nproceed.\\n\\nA State, I said, arises, as I conceive, out of the needs of mankind; no\\none is self-sufficing, but all of us have many wants. Can any other\\norigin of a State be imagined?\\n\\nThere can be no other.\\n\\nThen, as we have many wants, and many persons are needed to supply\\nthem, one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another; and\\nwhen these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation\\nthe body of inhabitants is termed a State.\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nAnd they exchange with one another, and one gives, and another\\nreceives, under the idea that the exchange will be for their good.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nThen, I said, let us begin and create in idea a State; and yet the true\\ncreator is necessity, who is the mother of our invention.\\n\\nOf course, he replied.\\n\\nNow the first and greatest of necessities is food, which is the\\ncondition of life and existence.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThe second is a dwelling, and the third clothing and the like.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great\\ndemand: We may suppose that one man is a husbandman, another a builder,\\nsome one else a weaver—shall we add to them a shoemaker, or perhaps\\nsome other purveyor to our bodily wants?\\n\\nQuite right.\\n\\nThe barest notion of a State must include four or five men.\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nAnd how will they proceed? Will each bring the result of his labours\\ninto a common stock?—the individual husbandman, for example, producing\\nfor four, and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in\\nthe provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself;\\nor will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of\\nproducing for them, but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food\\nin a fourth of the time, and in the remaining three fourths of his time\\nbe employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes, having no\\npartnership with others, but supplying himself all his own wants?\\n\\nAdeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at\\nproducing everything.\\n\\nProbably, I replied, that would be the better way; and when I hear you\\nsay this, I am myself reminded that we are not all alike; there are\\ndiversities of natures among us which are adapted to different\\noccupations.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd will you have a work better done when the workman has many\\noccupations, or when he has only one?\\n\\nWhen he has only one.\\n\\nFurther, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at\\nthe right time?\\n\\nNo doubt.\\n\\nFor business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is\\nat leisure; but the doer must follow up what he is doing, and make the\\nbusiness his first object.\\n\\nHe must.\\n\\nAnd if so, we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully\\nand easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is\\nnatural to him and does it at the right time, and leaves other things.\\n\\nUndoubtedly.\\n\\nThen more than four citizens will be required; for the husbandman will\\nnot make his own plough or mattock, or other implements of agriculture,\\nif they are to be good for anything. Neither will the builder make his\\ntools—and he too needs many; and in like manner the weaver and\\nshoemaker.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThen carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be sharers\\nin our little State, which is already beginning to grow?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nYet even if we add neatherds, shepherds, and other herdsmen, in order\\nthat our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with, and builders as well\\nas husbandmen may have draught cattle, and curriers and weavers fleeces\\nand hides,—still our State will not be very large.\\n\\nThat is true; yet neither will it be a very small State which contains\\nall these.\\n\\nThen, again, there is the situation of the city—to find a place where\\nnothing need be imported is wellnigh impossible.\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nThen there must be another class of citizens who will bring the\\nrequired supply from another city?\\n\\nThere must.\\n\\nBut if the trader goes empty-handed, having nothing which they require\\nwho would supply his need, he will come back empty-handed.\\n\\nThat is certain.\\n\\nAnd therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for\\nthemselves, but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate\\nthose from whom their wants are supplied.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nThen more husbandmen and more artisans will be required?\\n\\nThey will.\\n\\nNot to mention the importers and exporters, who are called merchants?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThen we shall want merchants?\\n\\nWe shall.\\n\\nAnd if merchandise is to be carried over the sea, skilful sailors will\\nalso be needed, and in considerable numbers?\\n\\nYes, in considerable numbers.\\n\\nThen, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?\\nTo secure such an exchange was, as you will remember, one of our\\nprincipal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a\\nState.\\n\\nClearly they will buy and sell.\\n\\nThen they will need a market-place, and a money-token for purposes of\\nexchange.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nSuppose now that a husbandman, or an artisan, brings some production to\\nmarket, and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with\\nhim,—is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the market-place?\\n\\nNot at all; he will find people there who, seeing the want, undertake\\nthe office of salesmen. In well-ordered states they are commonly those\\nwho are the weakest in bodily strength, and therefore of little use for\\nany other purpose; their duty is to be in the market, and to give money\\nin exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money\\nfrom those who desire to buy.\\n\\nThis want, then, creates a class of retail-traders in our State. Is not\\n‘retailer’ the term which is applied to those who sit in the\\nmarket-place engaged in buying and selling, while those who wander from\\none city to another are called merchants?\\n\\nYes, he said.\\n\\nAnd there is another class of servants, who are intellectually hardly\\non the level of companionship; still they have plenty of bodily\\nstrength for labour, which accordingly they sell, and are called, if I\\ndo not mistake, hirelings, hire being the name which is given to the\\nprice of their labour.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThen hirelings will help to make up our population?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd now, Adeimantus, is our State matured and perfected?\\n\\nI think so.\\n\\nWhere, then, is justice, and where is injustice, and in what part of\\nthe State did they spring up?\\n\\nProbably in the dealings of these citizens with one another. I cannot\\nimagine that they are more likely to be found any where else.\\n\\nI dare say that you are right in your suggestion, I said; we had better\\nthink the matter out, and not shrink from the enquiry.\\n\\nLet us then consider, first of all, what will be their way of life, now\\nthat we have thus established them. Will they not produce corn, and\\nwine, and clothes, and shoes, and build houses for themselves? And when\\nthey are housed, they will work, in summer, commonly, stripped and\\nbarefoot, but in winter substantially clothed and shod. They will feed\\non barley-meal and flour of wheat, baking and kneading them, making\\nnoble cakes and loaves; these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or\\non clean leaves, themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with\\nyew or myrtle. And they and their children will feast, drinking of the\\nwine which they have made, wearing garlands on their heads, and hymning\\nthe praises of the gods, in happy converse with one another. And they\\nwill take care that their families do not exceed their means; having an\\neye to poverty or war.\\n\\nBut, said Glaucon, interposing, you have not given them a relish to\\ntheir meal.\\n\\nTrue, I replied, I had forgotten; of course they must have a\\nrelish—salt, and olives, and cheese, and they will boil roots and herbs\\nsuch as country people prepare; for a dessert we shall give them figs,\\nand peas, and beans; and they will roast myrtle-berries and acorns at\\nthe fire, drinking in moderation. And with such a diet they may be\\nexpected to live in peace and health to a good old age, and bequeath a\\nsimilar life to their children after them.\\n\\nYes, Socrates, he said, and if you were providing for a city of pigs,\\nhow else would you feed the beasts?\\n\\nBut what would you have, Glaucon? I replied.\\n\\nWhy, he said, you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life.\\nPeople who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas, and\\ndine off tables, and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern\\nstyle.\\n\\nYes, I said, now I understand: the question which you would have me\\nconsider is, not only how a State, but how a luxurious State is\\ncreated; and possibly there is no harm in this, for in such a State we\\nshall be more likely to see how justice and injustice originate. In my\\nopinion the true and healthy constitution of the State is the one which\\nI have described. But if you wish also to see a State at fever-heat, I\\nhave no objection. For I suspect that many will not be satisfied with\\nthe simpler way of life. They will be for adding sofas, and tables, and\\nother furniture; also dainties, and perfumes, and incense, and\\ncourtesans, and cakes, all these not of one sort only, but in every\\nvariety; we must go beyond the necessaries of which I was at first\\nspeaking, such as houses, and clothes, and shoes: the arts of the\\npainter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion, and gold and\\nivory and all sorts of materials must be procured.\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nThen we must enlarge our borders; for the original healthy State is no\\nlonger sufficient. Now will the city have to fill and swell with a\\nmultitude of callings which are not required by any natural want; such\\nas the whole tribe of hunters and actors, of whom one large class have\\nto do with forms and colours; another will be the votaries of\\nmusic—poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists, players, dancers,\\ncontractors; also makers of divers kinds of articles, including women’s\\ndresses. And we shall want more servants. Will not tutors be also in\\nrequest, and nurses wet and dry, tirewomen and barbers, as well as\\nconfectioners and cooks; and swineherds, too, who were not needed and\\ntherefore had no place in the former edition of our State, but are\\nneeded now? They must not be forgotten: and there will be animals of\\nmany other kinds, if people eat them.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians\\nthan before?\\n\\nMuch greater.\\n\\nAnd the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants\\nwill be too small now, and not enough?\\n\\nQuite true.\\n\\nThen a slice of our neighbours’ land will be wanted by us for pasture\\nand tillage, and they will want a slice of ours, if, like ourselves,\\nthey exceed the limit of necessity, and give themselves up to the\\nunlimited accumulation of wealth?\\n\\nThat, Socrates, will be inevitable.\\n\\nAnd so we shall go to war, Glaucon. Shall we not?\\n\\nMost certainly, he replied.\\n\\nThen without determining as yet whether war does good or harm, thus\\nmuch we may affirm, that now we have discovered war to be derived from\\ncauses which are also the causes of almost all the evils in States,\\nprivate as well as public.\\n\\nUndoubtedly.\\n\\nAnd our State must once more enlarge; and this time the enlargement\\nwill be nothing short of a whole army, which will have to go out and\\nfight with the invaders for all that we have, as well as for the things\\nand persons whom we were describing above.\\n\\nWhy? he said; are they not capable of defending themselves?\\n\\nNo, I said; not if we were right in the principle which was\\nacknowledged by all of us when we were framing the State: the\\nprinciple, as you will remember, was that one man cannot practise many\\narts with success.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nBut is not war an art?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking?\\n\\nQuite true.\\n\\nAnd the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be a husbandman, or a\\nweaver, or a builder—in order that we might have our shoes well made;\\nbut to him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he\\nwas by nature fitted, and at that he was to continue working all his\\nlife long and at no other; he was not to let opportunities slip, and\\nthen he would become a good workman. Now nothing can be more important\\nthan that the work of a soldier should be well done. But is war an art\\nso easily acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a\\nhusbandman, or shoemaker, or other artisan; although no one in the\\nworld would be a good dice or draught player who merely took up the\\ngame as a recreation, and had not from his earliest years devoted\\nhimself to this and nothing else? No tools will make a man a skilled\\nworkman, or master of defence, nor be of any use to him who has not\\nlearned how to handle them, and has never bestowed any attention upon\\nthem. How then will he who takes up a shield or other implement of war\\nbecome a good fighter all in a day, whether with heavy-armed or any\\nother kind of troops?\\n\\nYes, he said, the tools which would teach men their own use would be\\nbeyond price.\\n\\nAnd the higher the duties of the guardian, I said, the more time, and\\nskill, and art, and application will be needed by him?\\n\\nNo doubt, he replied.\\n\\nWill he not also require natural aptitude for his calling?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThen it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted\\nfor the task of guarding the city?\\n\\nIt will.\\n\\nAnd the selection will be no easy matter, I said; but we must be brave\\nand do our best.\\n\\nWe must.\\n\\nIs not the noble youth very like a well-bred dog in respect of guarding\\nand watching?\\n\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nI mean that both of them ought to be quick to see, and swift to\\novertake the enemy when they see him; and strong too if, when they have\\ncaught him, they have to fight with him.\\n\\nAll these qualities, he replied, will certainly be required by them.\\n\\nWell, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or dog or\\nany other animal? Have you never observed how invincible and\\nunconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of\\nany creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable?\\n\\nI have.\\n\\nThen now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are\\nrequired in the guardian.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd also of the mental ones; his soul is to be full of spirit?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nBut are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another,\\nand with everybody else?\\n\\nA difficulty by no means easy to overcome, he replied.\\n\\nWhereas, I said, they ought to be dangerous to their enemies, and\\ngentle to their friends; if not, they will destroy themselves without\\nwaiting for their enemies to destroy them.\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nWhat is to be done then? I said; how shall we find a gentle nature\\nwhich has also a great spirit, for the one is the contradiction of the\\nother?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nHe will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two\\nqualities; and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible;\\nand hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible.\\n\\nI am afraid that what you say is true, he replied.\\n\\nHere feeling perplexed I began to think over what had preceded.—My\\nfriend, I said, no wonder that we are in a perplexity; for we have lost\\nsight of the image which we had before us.\\n\\nWhat do you mean? he said.\\n\\nI mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite\\nqualities.\\n\\nAnd where do you find them?\\n\\nMany animals, I replied, furnish examples of them; our friend the dog\\nis a very good one: you know that well-bred dogs are perfectly gentle\\nto their familiars and acquaintances, and the reverse to strangers.\\n\\nYes, I know.\\n\\nThen there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our\\nfinding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nWould not he who is fitted to be a guardian, besides the spirited\\nnature, need to have the qualities of a philosopher?\\n\\nI do not apprehend your meaning.\\n\\nThe trait of which I am speaking, I replied, may be also seen in the\\ndog, and is remarkable in the animal.\\n\\nWhat trait?\\n\\nWhy, a dog, whenever he sees a stranger, is angry; when an\\nacquaintance, he welcomes him, although the one has never done him any\\nharm, nor the other any good. Did this never strike you as curious?\\n\\nThe matter never struck me before; but I quite recognise the truth of\\nyour remark.\\n\\nAnd surely this instinct of the dog is very charming;—your dog is a\\ntrue philosopher.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nWhy, because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only\\nby the criterion of knowing and not knowing. And must not an animal be\\na lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the\\ntest of knowledge and ignorance?\\n\\nMost assuredly.\\n\\nAnd is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is\\nphilosophy?\\n\\nThey are the same, he replied.\\n\\nAnd may we not say confidently of man also, that he who is likely to be\\ngentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover of\\nwisdom and knowledge?\\n\\nThat we may safely affirm.\\n\\nThen he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the State will\\nrequire to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and\\nstrength?\\n\\nUndoubtedly.\\n\\nThen we have found the desired natures; and now that we have found\\nthem, how are they to be reared and educated? Is not this an enquiry\\nwhich may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is\\nour final end—How do justice and injustice grow up in States? for we do\\nnot want either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the\\nargument to an inconvenient length.\\n\\nAdeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us.\\n\\nThen, I said, my dear friend, the task must not be given up, even if\\nsomewhat long.\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nCome then, and let us pass a leisure hour in story-telling, and our\\nstory shall be the education of our heroes.\\n\\nBy all means.\\n\\nAnd what shall be their education? Can we find a better than the\\ntraditional sort?—and this has two divisions, gymnastic for the body,\\nand music for the soul.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nShall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic afterwards?\\n\\nBy all means.\\n\\nAnd when you speak of music, do you include literature or not?\\n\\nI do.\\n\\nAnd literature may be either true or false?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd the young should be trained in both kinds, and we begin with the\\nfalse?\\n\\nI do not understand your meaning, he said.\\n\\nYou know, I said, that we begin by telling children stories which,\\nthough not wholly destitute of truth, are in the main fictitious; and\\nthese stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn\\ngymnastics.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nThat was my meaning when I said that we must teach music before\\ngymnastics.\\n\\nQuite right, he said.\\n\\nYou know also that the beginning is the most important part of any\\nwork, especially in the case of a young and tender thing; for that is\\nthe time at which the character is being formed and the desired\\nimpression is more readily taken.\\n\\nQuite true.\\n\\nAnd shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales\\nwhich may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds\\nideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish\\nthem to have when they are grown up?\\n\\nWe cannot.\\n\\nThen the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers\\nof fiction, and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is\\ngood, and reject the bad; and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell\\ntheir children the authorised ones only. Let them fashion the mind with\\nsuch tales, even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands;\\nbut most of those which are now in use must be discarded.\\n\\nOf what tales are you speaking? he said.\\n\\nYou may find a model of the lesser in the greater, I said; for they are\\nnecessarily of the same type, and there is the same spirit in both of\\nthem.\\n\\nVery likely, he replied; but I do not as yet know what you would term\\nthe greater.\\n\\nThose, I said, which are narrated by Homer and Hesiod, and the rest of\\nthe poets, who have ever been the great story-tellers of mankind.\\n\\nBut which stories do you mean, he said; and what fault do you find with\\nthem?\\n\\nA fault which is most serious, I said; the fault of telling a lie, and,\\nwhat is more, a bad lie.\\n\\nBut when is this fault committed?\\n\\nWhenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and\\nheroes,—as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a\\nlikeness to the original.\\n\\nYes, he said, that sort of thing is certainly very blameable; but what\\nare the stories which you mean?\\n\\nFirst of all, I said, there was that greatest of all lies in high\\nplaces, which the poet told about Uranus, and which was a bad lie\\ntoo,—I mean what Hesiod says that Uranus did, and how Cronus retaliated\\non him. The doings of Cronus, and the sufferings which in turn his son\\ninflicted upon him, even if they were true, ought certainly not to be\\nlightly told to young and thoughtless persons; if possible, they had\\nbetter be buried in silence. But if there is an absolute necessity for\\ntheir mention, a chosen few might hear them in a mystery, and they\\nshould sacrifice not a common (Eleusinian) pig, but some huge and\\nunprocurable victim; and then the number of the hearers will be very\\nfew indeed.\\n\\nWhy, yes, said he, those stories are extremely objectionable.\\n\\nYes, Adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our State; the\\nyoung man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he\\nis far from doing anything outrageous; and that even if he chastises\\nhis father when he does wrong, in whatever manner, he will only be\\nfollowing the example of the first and greatest among the gods.\\n\\nI entirely agree with you, he said; in my opinion those stories are\\nquite unfit to be repeated.\\n\\nNeither, if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of\\nquarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest, should any\\nword be said to them of the wars in heaven, and of the plots and\\nfightings of the gods against one another, for they are not true. No,\\nwe shall never mention the battles of the giants, or let them be\\nembroidered on garments; and we shall be silent about the innumerable\\nother quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and relatives. If\\nthey would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling is\\nunholy, and that never up to this time has there been any quarrel\\nbetween citizens; this is what old men and old women should begin by\\ntelling children; and when they grow up, the poets also should be told\\nto compose for them in a similar spirit. But the narrative of\\nHephaestus binding Here his mother, or how on another occasion Zeus\\nsent him flying for taking her part when she was being beaten, and all\\nthe battles of the gods in Homer—these tales must not be admitted into\\nour State, whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or\\nnot. For a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is\\nliteral; anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely\\nto become indelible and unalterable; and therefore it is most important\\nthat the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous\\nthoughts.\\n\\nThere you are right, he replied; but if any one asks where are such\\nmodels to be found and of what tales are you speaking—how shall we\\nanswer him?\\n\\nI said to him, You and I, Adeimantus, at this moment are not poets, but\\nfounders of a State: now the founders of a State ought to know the\\ngeneral forms in which poets should cast their tales, and the limits\\nwhich must be observed by them, but to make the tales is not their\\nbusiness.\\n\\nVery true, he said; but what are these forms of theology which you\\nmean?\\n\\nSomething of this kind, I replied:—God is always to be represented as\\nhe truly is, whatever be the sort of poetry, epic, lyric or tragic, in\\nwhich the representation is given.\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nAnd is he not truly good? and must he not be represented as such?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd no good thing is hurtful?\\n\\nNo, indeed.\\n\\nAnd that which is not hurtful hurts not?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nAnd that which hurts not does no evil?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nAnd can that which does no evil be a cause of evil?\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nAnd the good is advantageous?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd therefore the cause of well-being?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nIt follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things, but\\nof the good only?\\n\\nAssuredly.\\n\\nThen God, if he be good, is not the author of all things, as the many\\nassert, but he is the cause of a few things only, and not of most\\nthings that occur to men. For few are the goods of human life, and many\\nare the evils, and the good is to be attributed to God alone; of the\\nevils the causes are to be sought elsewhere, and not in him.\\n\\nThat appears to me to be most true, he said.\\n\\nThen we must not listen to Homer or to any other poet who is guilty of\\nthe folly of saying that two casks\\n\\n‘Lie at the threshold of Zeus, full of lots, one of good, the other of\\nevil lots,’\\n\\nand that he to whom Zeus gives a mixture of the two\\n\\n‘Sometimes meets with evil fortune, at other times with good;’\\n\\nbut that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill,\\n\\n‘Him wild hunger drives o’er the beauteous earth.’\\n\\nAnd again—\\n\\n‘Zeus, who is the dispenser of good and evil to us.’\\n\\nAnd if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties, which\\nwas really the work of Pandarus, was brought about by Athene and Zeus,\\nor that the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by Themis\\nand Zeus, he shall not have our approval; neither will we allow our\\nyoung men to hear the words of Aeschylus, that\\n\\n‘God plants guilt among men when he desires utterly to destroy a\\nhouse.’\\n\\nAnd if a poet writes of the sufferings of Niobe—the subject of the\\ntragedy in which these iambic verses occur—or of the house of Pelops,\\nor of the Trojan war or on any similar theme, either we must not permit\\nhim to say that these are the works of God, or if they are of God, he\\nmust devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking; he must\\nsay that God did what was just and right, and they were the better for\\nbeing punished; but that those who are punished are miserable, and that\\nGod is the author of their misery—the poet is not to be permitted to\\nsay; though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they\\nrequire to be punished, and are benefited by receiving punishment from\\nGod; but that God being good is the author of evil to any one is to be\\nstrenuously denied, and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or\\nprose by any one whether old or young in any well-ordered commonwealth.\\nSuch a fiction is suicidal, ruinous, impious.\\n\\nI agree with you, he replied, and am ready to give my assent to the\\nlaw.\\n\\nLet this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods,\\nto which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform,—that God\\nis not the author of all things, but of good only.\\n\\nThat will do, he said.\\n\\nAnd what do you think of a second principle? Shall I ask you whether\\nGod is a magician, and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one\\nshape, and now in another—sometimes himself changing and passing into\\nmany forms, sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such\\ntransformations; or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own\\nproper image?\\n\\nI cannot answer you, he said, without more thought.\\n\\nWell, I said; but if we suppose a change in anything, that change must\\nbe effected either by the thing itself, or by some other thing?\\n\\nMost certainly.\\n\\nAnd things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered\\nor discomposed; for example, when healthiest and strongest, the human\\nframe is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks, and the plant\\nwhich is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the\\nheat of the sun or any similar causes.\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nAnd will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged\\nby any external influence?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd the same principle, as I should suppose, applies to all composite\\nthings—furniture, houses, garments: when good and well made, they are\\nleast altered by time and circumstances.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nThen everything which is good, whether made by art or nature, or both,\\nis least liable to suffer change from without?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nBut surely God and the things of God are in every way perfect?\\n\\nOf course they are.\\n\\nThen he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many\\nshapes?\\n\\nHe cannot.\\n\\nBut may he not change and transform himself?\\n\\nClearly, he said, that must be the case if he is changed at all.\\n\\nAnd will he then change himself for the better and fairer, or for the\\nworse and more unsightly?\\n\\nIf he change at all he can only change for the worse, for we cannot\\nsuppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty.\\n\\nVery true, Adeimantus; but then, would any one, whether God or man,\\ndesire to make himself worse?\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nThen it is impossible that God should ever be willing to change; being,\\nas is supposed, the fairest and best that is conceivable, every God\\nremains absolutely and for ever in his own form.\\n\\nThat necessarily follows, he said, in my judgment.\\n\\nThen, I said, my dear friend, let none of the poets tell us that\\n\\n‘The gods, taking the disguise of strangers from other lands, walk up\\nand down cities in all sorts of forms;’\\n\\nand let no one slander Proteus and Thetis, neither let any one, either\\nin tragedy or in any other kind of poetry, introduce Here disguised in\\nthe likeness of a priestess asking an alms\\n\\n‘For the life-giving daughters of Inachus the river of Argos;’\\n\\n—let us have no more lies of that sort. Neither must we have mothers\\nunder the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad\\nversion of these myths—telling how certain gods, as they say, ‘Go about\\nby night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms;’ but\\nlet them take heed lest they make cowards of their children, and at the\\nsame time speak blasphemy against the gods.\\n\\nHeaven forbid, he said.\\n\\nBut although the gods are themselves unchangeable, still by witchcraft\\nand deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms?\\n\\nPerhaps, he replied.\\n\\nWell, but can you imagine that God will be willing to lie, whether in\\nword or deed, or to put forth a phantom of himself?\\n\\nI cannot say, he replied.\\n\\nDo you not know, I said, that the true lie, if such an expression may\\nbe allowed, is hated of gods and men?\\n\\nWhat do you mean? he said.\\n\\nI mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest\\nand highest part of himself, or about the truest and highest matters;\\nthere, above all, he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him.\\n\\nStill, he said, I do not comprehend you.\\n\\nThe reason is, I replied, that you attribute some profound meaning to\\nmy words; but I am only saying that deception, or being deceived or\\nuninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of\\nthemselves, which is the soul, and in that part of them to have and to\\nhold the lie, is what mankind least like;—that, I say, is what they\\nutterly detest.\\n\\nThere is nothing more hateful to them.\\n\\nAnd, as I was just now remarking, this ignorance in the soul of him who\\nis deceived may be called the true lie; for the lie in words is only a\\nkind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the\\nsoul, not pure unadulterated falsehood. Am I not right?\\n\\nPerfectly right.\\n\\nThe true lie is hated not only by the gods, but also by men?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nWhereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful; in\\ndealing with enemies—that would be an instance; or again, when those\\nwhom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to\\ndo some harm, then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or\\npreventive; also in the tales of mythology, of which we were just now\\nspeaking—because we do not know the truth about ancient times, we make\\nfalsehood as much like truth as we can, and so turn it to account.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nBut can any of these reasons apply to God? Can we suppose that he is\\nignorant of antiquity, and therefore has recourse to invention?\\n\\nThat would be ridiculous, he said.\\n\\nThen the lying poet has no place in our idea of God?\\n\\nI should say not.\\n\\nOr perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies?\\n\\nThat is inconceivable.\\n\\nBut he may have friends who are senseless or mad?\\n\\nBut no mad or senseless person can be a friend of God.\\n\\nThen no motive can be imagined why God should lie?\\n\\nNone whatever.\\n\\nThen the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThen is God perfectly simple and true both in word and deed; he changes\\nnot; he deceives not, either by sign or word, by dream or waking\\nvision.\\n\\nYour thoughts, he said, are the reflection of my own.\\n\\nYou agree with me then, I said, that this is the second type or form in\\nwhich we should write and speak about divine things. The gods are not\\nmagicians who transform themselves, neither do they deceive mankind in\\nany way.\\n\\nI grant that.\\n\\nThen, although we are admirers of Homer, we do not admire the lying\\ndream which Zeus sends to Agamemnon; neither will we praise the verses\\nof Aeschylus in which Thetis says that Apollo at her nuptials\\n\\n‘Was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to be long,\\nand to know no sickness. And when he had spoken of my lot as in all\\nthings blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my\\nsoul. And I thought that the word of Phoebus, being divine and full of\\nprophecy, would not fail. And now he himself who uttered the strain, he\\nwho was present at the banquet, and who said this—he it is who has\\nslain my son.’\\n\\nThese are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our\\nanger; and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus; neither shall\\nwe allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young,\\nmeaning, as we do, that our guardians, as far as men can be, should be\\ntrue worshippers of the gods and like them.\\n\\nI entirely agree, he said, in these principles, and promise to make\\nthem my laws.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n BOOK III.\\n\\n\\nSuch then, I said, are our principles of theology—some tales are to be\\ntold, and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth\\nupwards, if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents, and to\\nvalue friendship with one another.\\n\\nYes; and I think that our principles are right, he said.\\n\\nBut if they are to be courageous, must they not learn other lessons\\nbesides these, and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of\\ndeath? Can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him?\\n\\nCertainly not, he said.\\n\\nAnd can he be fearless of death, or will he choose death in battle\\nrather than defeat and slavery, who believes the world below to be real\\nand terrible?\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nThen we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales\\nas well as over the others, and beg them not simply to revile but\\nrather to commend the world below, intimating to them that their\\ndescriptions are untrue, and will do harm to our future warriors.\\n\\nThat will be our duty, he said.\\n\\nThen, I said, we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages,\\nbeginning with the verses,\\n\\n‘I would rather be a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man\\nthan rule over all the dead who have come to nought.’\\n\\nWe must also expunge the verse, which tells us how Pluto feared,\\n\\n‘Lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should be seen\\nboth of mortals and immortals.’\\n\\nAnd again:—\\n\\n‘O heavens! verily in the house of Hades there is soul and ghostly form\\nbut no mind at all!’\\n\\nAgain of Tiresias:—\\n\\n‘(To him even after death did Persephone grant mind,) that he alone\\nshould be wise; but the other souls are flitting shades.’\\n\\nAgain:—\\n\\n‘The soul flying from the limbs had gone to Hades, lamenting her fate,\\nleaving manhood and youth.’\\n\\nAgain:—\\n\\n‘And the soul, with shrilling cry, passed like smoke beneath the\\nearth.’\\n\\nAnd,—\\n\\n‘As bats in hollow of mystic cavern, whenever any of them has dropped\\nout of the string and falls from the rock, fly shrilling and cling to\\none another, so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they\\nmoved.’\\n\\nAnd we must beg Homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike\\nout these and similar passages, not because they are unpoetical, or\\nunattractive to the popular ear, but because the greater the poetical\\ncharm of them, the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who\\nare meant to be free, and who should fear slavery more than death.\\n\\nUndoubtedly.\\n\\nAlso we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names which\\ndescribe the world below—Cocytus and Styx, ghosts under the earth, and\\nsapless shades, and any similar words of which the very mention causes\\na shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them. I do\\nnot say that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind;\\nbut there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered\\ntoo excitable and effeminate by them.\\n\\nThere is a real danger, he said.\\n\\nThen we must have no more of them.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnother and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us.\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nAnd shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous\\nmen?\\n\\nThey will go with the rest.\\n\\nBut shall we be right in getting rid of them? Reflect: our principle is\\nthat the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good\\nman who is his comrade.\\n\\nYes; that is our principle.\\n\\nAnd therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he\\nhad suffered anything terrible?\\n\\nHe will not.\\n\\nSuch an one, as we further maintain, is sufficient for himself and his\\nown happiness, and therefore is least in need of other men.\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nAnd for this reason the loss of a son or brother, or the deprivation of\\nfortune, is to him of all men least terrible.\\n\\nAssuredly.\\n\\nAnd therefore he will be least likely to lament, and will bear with the\\ngreatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him.\\n\\nYes, he will feel such a misfortune far less than another.\\n\\nThen we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous\\nmen, and making them over to women (and not even to women who are good\\nfor anything), or to men of a baser sort, that those who are being\\neducated by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the\\nlike.\\n\\nThat will be very right.\\n\\nThen we will once more entreat Homer and the other poets not to depict\\nAchilles, who is the son of a goddess, first lying on his side, then on\\nhis back, and then on his face; then starting up and sailing in a\\nfrenzy along the shores of the barren sea; now taking the sooty ashes\\nin both his hands and pouring them over his head, or weeping and\\nwailing in the various modes which Homer has delineated. Nor should he\\ndescribe Priam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching,\\n\\n‘Rolling in the dirt, calling each man loudly by his name.’\\n\\nStill more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce\\nthe gods lamenting and saying,\\n\\n‘Alas! my misery! Alas! that I bore the bravest to my sorrow.’\\n\\nBut if he must introduce the gods, at any rate let him not dare so\\ncompletely to misrepresent the greatest of the gods, as to make him\\nsay—\\n\\n‘O heavens! with my eyes verily I behold a dear friend of mine chased\\nround and round the city, and my heart is sorrowful.’\\n\\nOr again:—\\n\\nWoe is me that I am fated to have Sarpedon, dearest of men to me,\\nsubdued at the hands of Patroclus the son of Menoetius.’\\n\\nFor if, my sweet Adeimantus, our youth seriously listen to such\\nunworthy representations of the gods, instead of laughing at them as\\nthey ought, hardly will any of them deem that he himself, being but a\\nman, can be dishonoured by similar actions; neither will he rebuke any\\ninclination which may arise in his mind to say and do the like. And\\ninstead of having any shame or self-control, he will be always whining\\nand lamenting on slight occasions.\\n\\nYes, he said, that is most true.\\n\\nYes, I replied; but that surely is what ought not to be, as the\\nargument has just proved to us; and by that proof we must abide until\\nit is disproved by a better.\\n\\nIt ought not to be.\\n\\nNeither ought our guardians to be given to laughter. For a fit of\\nlaughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a\\nviolent reaction.\\n\\nSo I believe.\\n\\nThen persons of worth, even if only mortal men, must not be represented\\nas overcome by laughter, and still less must such a representation of\\nthe gods be allowed.\\n\\nStill less of the gods, as you say, he replied.\\n\\nThen we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods\\nas that of Homer when he describes how\\n\\n‘Inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods, when they saw\\nHephaestus bustling about the mansion.’\\n\\nOn your views, we must not admit them.\\n\\nOn my views, if you like to father them on me; that we must not admit\\nthem is certain.\\n\\nAgain, truth should be highly valued; if, as we were saying, a lie is\\nuseless to the gods, and useful only as a medicine to men, then the use\\nof such medicines should be restricted to physicians; private\\nindividuals have no business with them.\\n\\nClearly not, he said.\\n\\nThen if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying, the rulers of\\nthe State should be the persons; and they, in their dealings either\\nwith enemies or with their own citizens, may be allowed to lie for the\\npublic good. But nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind;\\nand although the rulers have this privilege, for a private man to lie\\nto them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the\\npatient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his\\nown bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer, or for a\\nsailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the ship and the\\nrest of the crew, and how things are going with himself or his fellow\\nsailors.\\n\\nMost true, he said.\\n\\nIf, then, the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the State,\\n\\n‘Any of the craftsmen, whether he be priest or physician or carpenter,’\\n\\nhe will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally\\nsubversive and destructive of ship or State.\\n\\nMost certainly, he said, if our idea of the State is ever carried out.\\n\\nIn the next place our youth must be temperate?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAre not the chief elements of temperance, speaking generally, obedience\\nto commanders and self-control in sensual pleasures?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThen we shall approve such language as that of Diomede in Homer,\\n\\n‘Friend, sit still and obey my word,’\\n\\nand the verses which follow,\\n\\n‘The Greeks marched breathing prowess, ...in silent awe of their\\nleaders,’\\n\\nand other sentiments of the same kind.\\n\\nWe shall.\\n\\nWhat of this line,\\n\\n‘O heavy with wine, who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a\\nstag,’\\n\\nand of the words which follow? Would you say that these, or any similar\\nimpertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to\\ntheir rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?\\n\\nThey are ill spoken.\\n\\nThey may very possibly afford some amusement, but they do not conduce\\nto temperance. And therefore they are likely to do harm to our young\\nmen—you would agree with me there?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd then, again, to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his\\nopinion is more glorious than\\n\\n‘When the tables are full of bread and meat, and the cup-bearer carries\\nround wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups,’\\n\\nis it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such\\nwords? Or the verse\\n\\n‘The saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger?’\\n\\nWhat would you say again to the tale of Zeus, who, while other gods and\\nmen were asleep and he the only person awake, lay devising plans, but\\nforgot them all in a moment through his lust, and was so completely\\novercome at the sight of Here that he would not even go into the hut,\\nbut wanted to lie with her on the ground, declaring that he had never\\nbeen in such a state of rapture before, even when they first met one\\nanother\\n\\n‘Without the knowledge of their parents;’\\n\\nor that other tale of how Hephaestus, because of similar goings on,\\ncast a chain around Ares and Aphrodite?\\n\\nIndeed, he said, I am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear\\nthat sort of thing.\\n\\nBut any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men, these\\nthey ought to see and hear; as, for example, what is said in the\\nverses,\\n\\n‘He smote his breast, and thus reproached his heart, Endure, my heart;\\nfar worse hast thou endured!’\\n\\nCertainly, he said.\\n\\nIn the next place, we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers\\nof money.\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nNeither must we sing to them of\\n\\n‘Gifts persuading gods, and persuading reverend kings.’\\n\\nNeither is Phoenix, the tutor of Achilles, to be approved or deemed to\\nhave given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take\\nthe gifts of the Greeks and assist them; but that without a gift he\\nshould not lay aside his anger. Neither will we believe or acknowledge\\nAchilles himself to have been such a lover of money that he took\\nAgamemnon’s gifts, or that when he had received payment he restored the\\ndead body of Hector, but that without payment he was unwilling to do\\nso.\\n\\nUndoubtedly, he said, these are not sentiments which can be approved.\\n\\nLoving Homer as I do, I hardly like to say that in attributing these\\nfeelings to Achilles, or in believing that they are truly attributed to\\nhim, he is guilty of downright impiety. As little can I believe the\\nnarrative of his insolence to Apollo, where he says,\\n\\n‘Thou hast wronged me, O far-darter, most abominable of deities. Verily\\nI would be even with thee, if I had only the power;’\\n\\nor his insubordination to the river-god, on whose divinity he is ready\\nto lay hands; or his offering to the dead Patroclus of his own hair,\\nwhich had been previously dedicated to the other river-god Spercheius,\\nand that he actually performed this vow; or that he dragged Hector\\nround the tomb of Patroclus, and slaughtered the captives at the pyre;\\nof all this I cannot believe that he was guilty, any more than I can\\nallow our citizens to believe that he, the wise Cheiron’s pupil, the\\nson of a goddess and of Peleus who was the gentlest of men and third in\\ndescent from Zeus, was so disordered in his wits as to be at one time\\nthe slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions, meanness, not\\nuntainted by avarice, combined with overweening contempt of gods and\\nmen.\\n\\nYou are quite right, he replied.\\n\\nAnd let us equally refuse to believe, or allow to be repeated, the tale\\nof Theseus son of Poseidon, or of Peirithous son of Zeus, going forth\\nas they did to perpetrate a horrid rape; or of any other hero or son of\\na god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely\\nascribe to them in our day: and let us further compel the poets to\\ndeclare either that these acts were not done by them, or that they were\\nnot the sons of gods;—both in the same breath they shall not be\\npermitted to affirm. We will not have them trying to persuade our youth\\nthat the gods are the authors of evil, and that heroes are no better\\nthan men—sentiments which, as we were saying, are neither pious nor\\ntrue, for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the gods.\\n\\nAssuredly not.\\n\\nAnd further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear\\nthem; for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is\\nconvinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by—\\n\\n‘The kindred of the gods, the relatives of Zeus, whose ancestral altar,\\nthe altar of Zeus, is aloft in air on the peak of Ida,’\\n\\nand who have\\n\\n‘the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins.’\\n\\nAnd therefore let us put an end to such tales, lest they engender\\nlaxity of morals among the young.\\n\\nBy all means, he replied.\\n\\nBut now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not\\nto be spoken of, let us see whether any have been omitted by us. The\\nmanner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should\\nbe treated has been already laid down.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd what shall we say about men? That is clearly the remaining portion\\nof our subject.\\n\\nClearly so.\\n\\nBut we are not in a condition to answer this question at present, my\\nfriend.\\n\\nWhy not?\\n\\nBecause, if I am not mistaken, we shall have to say that about men\\npoets and story-tellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements\\nwhen they tell us that wicked men are often happy, and the good\\nmiserable; and that injustice is profitable when undetected, but that\\njustice is a man’s own loss and another’s gain—these things we shall\\nforbid them to utter, and command them to sing and say the opposite.\\n\\nTo be sure we shall, he replied.\\n\\nBut if you admit that I am right in this, then I shall maintain that\\nyou have implied the principle for which we have been all along\\ncontending.\\n\\nI grant the truth of your inference.\\n\\nThat such things are or are not to be said about men is a question\\nwhich we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is, and\\nhow naturally advantageous to the possessor, whether he seem to be just\\nor not.\\n\\nMost true, he said.\\n\\nEnough of the subjects of poetry: let us now speak of the style; and\\nwhen this has been considered, both matter and manner will have been\\ncompletely treated.\\n\\nI do not understand what you mean, said Adeimantus.\\n\\nThen I must make you understand; and perhaps I may be more intelligible\\nif I put the matter in this way. You are aware, I suppose, that all\\nmythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or\\nto come?\\n\\nCertainly, he replied.\\n\\nAnd narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union\\nof the two?\\n\\nThat again, he said, I do not quite understand.\\n\\nI fear that I must be a ridiculous teacher when I have so much\\ndifficulty in making myself apprehended. Like a bad speaker, therefore,\\nI will not take the whole of the subject, but will break a piece off in\\nillustration of my meaning. You know the first lines of the Iliad, in\\nwhich the poet says that Chryses prayed Agamemnon to release his\\ndaughter, and that Agamemnon flew into a passion with him; whereupon\\nChryses, failing of his object, invoked the anger of the God against\\nthe Achaeans. Now as far as these lines,\\n\\n‘And he prayed all the Greeks, but especially the two sons of Atreus,\\nthe chiefs of the people,’\\n\\nthe poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose\\nthat he is any one else. But in what follows he takes the person of\\nChryses, and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the\\nspeaker is not Homer, but the aged priest himself. And in this double\\nform he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at\\nTroy and in Ithaca and throughout the Odyssey.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites\\nfrom time to time and in the intermediate passages?\\n\\nQuite true.\\n\\nBut when the poet speaks in the person of another, may we not say that\\nhe assimilates his style to that of the person who, as he informs you,\\nis going to speak?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice\\nor gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes?\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nThen in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by\\nway of imitation?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nOr, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then\\nagain the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple\\nnarration. However, in order that I may make my meaning quite clear,\\nand that you may no more say, ‘I don’t understand,’ I will show how the\\nchange might be effected. If Homer had said, ‘The priest came, having\\nhis daughter’s ransom in his hands, supplicating the Achaeans, and\\nabove all the kings;’ and then if, instead of speaking in the person of\\nChryses, he had continued in his own person, the words would have been,\\nnot imitation, but simple narration. The passage would have run as\\nfollows (I am no poet, and therefore I drop the metre), ‘The priest\\ncame and prayed the gods on behalf of the Greeks that they might\\ncapture Troy and return safely home, but begged that they would give\\nhim back his daughter, and take the ransom which he brought, and\\nrespect the God. Thus he spoke, and the other Greeks revered the priest\\nand assented. But Agamemnon was wroth, and bade him depart and not come\\nagain, lest the staff and chaplets of the God should be of no avail to\\nhim—the daughter of Chryses should not be released, he said—she should\\ngrow old with him in Argos. And then he told him to go away and not to\\nprovoke him, if he intended to get home unscathed. And the old man went\\naway in fear and silence, and, when he had left the camp, he called\\nupon Apollo by his many names, reminding him of everything which he had\\ndone pleasing to him, whether in building his temples, or in offering\\nsacrifice, and praying that his good deeds might be returned to him,\\nand that the Achaeans might expiate his tears by the arrows of the\\ngod,’—and so on. In this way the whole becomes simple narrative.\\n\\nI understand, he said.\\n\\nOr you may suppose the opposite case—that the intermediate passages are\\nomitted, and the dialogue only left.\\n\\nThat also, he said, I understand; you mean, for example, as in tragedy.\\n\\nYou have conceived my meaning perfectly; and if I mistake not, what you\\nfailed to apprehend before is now made clear to you, that poetry and\\nmythology are, in some cases, wholly imitative—instances of this are\\nsupplied by tragedy and comedy; there is likewise the opposite style,\\nin which the poet is the only speaker—of this the dithyramb affords the\\nbest example; and the combination of both is found in epic, and in\\nseveral other styles of poetry. Do I take you with me?\\n\\nYes, he said; I see now what you meant.\\n\\nI will ask you to remember also what I began by saying, that we had\\ndone with the subject and might proceed to the style.\\n\\nYes, I remember.\\n\\nIn saying this, I intended to imply that we must come to an\\nunderstanding about the mimetic art,—whether the poets, in narrating\\ntheir stories, are to be allowed by us to imitate, and if so, whether\\nin whole or in part, and if the latter, in what parts; or should all\\nimitation be prohibited?\\n\\nYou mean, I suspect, to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be\\nadmitted into our State?\\n\\nYes, I said; but there may be more than this in question: I really do\\nnot know as yet, but whither the argument may blow, thither we go.\\n\\nAnd go we will, he said.\\n\\nThen, Adeimantus, let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be\\nimitators; or rather, has not this question been decided by the rule\\nalready laid down that one man can only do one thing well, and not\\nmany; and that if he attempt many, he will altogether fail of gaining\\nmuch reputation in any?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd this is equally true of imitation; no one man can imitate many\\nthings as well as he would imitate a single one?\\n\\nHe cannot.\\n\\nThen the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in\\nlife, and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other\\nparts as well; for even when two species of imitation are nearly\\nallied, the same persons cannot succeed in both, as, for example, the\\nwriters of tragedy and comedy—did you not just now call them\\nimitations?\\n\\nYes, I did; and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot\\nsucceed in both.\\n\\nAny more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nNeither are comic and tragic actors the same; yet all these things are\\nbut imitations.\\n\\nThey are so.\\n\\nAnd human nature, Adeimantus, appears to have been coined into yet\\nsmaller pieces, and to be as incapable of imitating many things well,\\nas of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies.\\n\\nQuite true, he replied.\\n\\nIf then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our\\nguardians, setting aside every other business, are to dedicate\\nthemselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the State, making\\nthis their craft, and engaging in no work which does not bear on this\\nend, they ought not to practise or imitate anything else; if they\\nimitate at all, they should imitate from youth upward only those\\ncharacters which are suitable to their profession—the courageous,\\ntemperate, holy, free, and the like; but they should not depict or be\\nskilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness, lest from\\nimitation they should come to be what they imitate. Did you never\\nobserve how imitations, beginning in early youth and continuing far\\ninto life, at length grow into habits and become a second nature,\\naffecting body, voice, and mind?\\n\\nYes, certainly, he said.\\n\\nThen, I said, we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of\\nwhom we say that they ought to be good men, to imitate a woman, whether\\nyoung or old, quarrelling with her husband, or striving and vaunting\\nagainst the gods in conceit of her happiness, or when she is in\\naffliction, or sorrow, or weeping; and certainly not one who is in\\nsickness, love, or labour.\\n\\nVery right, he said.\\n\\nNeither must they represent slaves, male or female, performing the\\noffices of slaves?\\n\\nThey must not.\\n\\nAnd surely not bad men, whether cowards or any others, who do the\\nreverse of what we have just been prescribing, who scold or mock or\\nrevile one another in drink or out of drink, or who in any other manner\\nsin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed, as the\\nmanner of such is. Neither should they be trained to imitate the action\\nor speech of men or women who are mad or bad; for madness, like vice,\\nis to be known but not to be practised or imitated.\\n\\nVery true, he replied.\\n\\nNeither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or\\nboatswains, or the like?\\n\\nHow can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds\\nto the callings of any of these?\\n\\nNor may they imitate the neighing of horses, the bellowing of bulls,\\nthe murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean, thunder, and all that sort\\nof thing?\\n\\nNay, he said, if madness be forbidden, neither may they copy the\\nbehaviour of madmen.\\n\\nYou mean, I said, if I understand you aright, that there is one sort of\\nnarrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has\\nanything to say, and that another sort will be used by a man of an\\nopposite character and education.\\n\\nAnd which are these two sorts? he asked.\\n\\nSuppose, I answered, that a just and good man in the course of a\\nnarration comes on some saying or action of another good man,—I should\\nimagine that he will like to personate him, and will not be ashamed of\\nthis sort of imitation: he will be most ready to play the part of the\\ngood man when he is acting firmly and wisely; in a less degree when he\\nis overtaken by illness or love or drink, or has met with any other\\ndisaster. But when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him, he\\nwill not make a study of that; he will disdain such a person, and will\\nassume his likeness, if at all, for a moment only when he is performing\\nsome good action; at other times he will be ashamed to play a part\\nwhich he has never practised, nor will he like to fashion and frame\\nhimself after the baser models; he feels the employment of such an art,\\nunless in jest, to be beneath him, and his mind revolts at it.\\n\\nSo I should expect, he replied.\\n\\nThen he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated out\\nof Homer, that is to say, his style will be both imitative and\\nnarrative; but there will be very little of the former, and a great\\ndeal of the latter. Do you agree?\\n\\nCertainly, he said; that is the model which such a speaker must\\nnecessarily take.\\n\\nBut there is another sort of character who will narrate anything, and,\\nthe worse he is, the more unscrupulous he will be; nothing will be too\\nbad for him: and he will be ready to imitate anything, not as a joke,\\nbut in right good earnest, and before a large company. As I was just\\nnow saying, he will attempt to represent the roll of thunder, the noise\\nof wind and hail, or the creaking of wheels, and pulleys, and the\\nvarious sounds of flutes, pipes, trumpets, and all sorts of\\ninstruments: he will bark like a dog, bleat like a sheep, or crow like\\na cock; his entire art will consist in imitation of voice and gesture,\\nand there will be very little narration.\\n\\nThat, he said, will be his mode of speaking.\\n\\nThese, then, are the two kinds of style?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and\\nhas but slight changes; and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen\\nfor their simplicity, the result is that the speaker, if he speaks\\ncorrectly, is always pretty much the same in style, and he will keep\\nwithin the limits of a single harmony (for the changes are not great),\\nand in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm?\\n\\nThat is quite true, he said.\\n\\nWhereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of\\nrhythms, if the music and the style are to correspond, because the\\nstyle has all sorts of changes.\\n\\nThat is also perfectly true, he replied.\\n\\nAnd do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all\\npoetry, and every form of expression in words? No one can say anything\\nexcept in one or other of them or in both together.\\n\\nThey include all, he said.\\n\\nAnd shall we receive into our State all the three styles, or one only\\nof the two unmixed styles? or would you include the mixed?\\n\\nI should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue.\\n\\nYes, I said, Adeimantus, but the mixed style is also very charming: and\\nindeed the pantomimic, which is the opposite of the one chosen by you,\\nis the most popular style with children and their attendants, and with\\nthe world in general.\\n\\nI do not deny it.\\n\\nBut I suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our\\nState, in which human nature is not twofold or manifold, for one man\\nplays one part only?\\n\\nYes; quite unsuitable.\\n\\nAnd this is the reason why in our State, and in our State only, we\\nshall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also, and a\\nhusbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also, and a soldier a\\nsoldier and not a trader also, and the same throughout?\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nAnd therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen, who are so\\nclever that they can imitate anything, comes to us, and makes a\\nproposal to exhibit himself and his poetry, we will fall down and\\nworship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being; but we must also\\ninform him that in our State such as he are not permitted to exist; the\\nlaw will not allow them. And so when we have anointed him with myrrh,\\nand set a garland of wool upon his head, we shall send him away to\\nanother city. For we mean to employ for our souls’ health the rougher\\nand severer poet or story-teller, who will imitate the style of the\\nvirtuous only, and will follow those models which we prescribed at\\nfirst when we began the education of our soldiers.\\n\\nWe certainly will, he said, if we have the power.\\n\\nThen now, my friend, I said, that part of music or literary education\\nwhich relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished;\\nfor the matter and manner have both been discussed.\\n\\nI think so too, he said.\\n\\nNext in order will follow melody and song.\\n\\nThat is obvious.\\n\\nEvery one can see already what we ought to say about them, if we are to\\nbe consistent with ourselves.\\n\\nI fear, said Glaucon, laughing, that the word ‘every one’ hardly\\nincludes me, for I cannot at the moment say what they should be; though\\nI may guess.\\n\\nAt any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts—the words,\\nthe melody, and the rhythm; that degree of knowledge I may presuppose?\\n\\nYes, he said; so much as that you may.\\n\\nAnd as for the words, there will surely be no difference between words\\nwhich are and which are not set to music; both will conform to the same\\nlaws, and these have been already determined by us?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nWe were saying, when we spoke of the subject-matter, that we had no\\nneed of lamentation and strains of sorrow?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow? You are musical, and\\ncan tell me.\\n\\nThe harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor Lydian, and the\\nfull-toned or bass Lydian, and such like.\\n\\nThese then, I said, must be banished; even to women who have a\\ncharacter to maintain they are of no use, and much less to men.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nIn the next place, drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly\\nunbecoming the character of our guardians.\\n\\nUtterly unbecoming.\\n\\nAnd which are the soft or drinking harmonies?\\n\\nThe Ionian, he replied, and the Lydian; they are termed ‘relaxed.’\\n\\nWell, and are these of any military use?\\n\\nQuite the reverse, he replied; and if so the Dorian and the Phrygian\\nare the only ones which you have left.\\n\\nI answered: Of the harmonies I know nothing, but I want to have one\\nwarlike, to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the\\nhour of danger and stern resolve, or when his cause is failing, and he\\nis going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil, and at\\nevery such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a\\ndetermination to endure; and another to be used by him in times of\\npeace and freedom of action, when there is no pressure of necessity,\\nand he is seeking to persuade God by prayer, or man by instruction and\\nadmonition, or on the other hand, when he is expressing his willingness\\nto yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition, and which represents\\nhim when by prudent conduct he has attained his end, not carried away\\nby his success, but acting moderately and wisely under the\\ncircumstances, and acquiescing in the event. These two harmonies I ask\\nyou to leave; the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom, the\\nstrain of the unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate, the strain\\nof courage, and the strain of temperance; these, I say, leave.\\n\\nAnd these, he replied, are the Dorian and Phrygian harmonies of which I\\nwas just now speaking.\\n\\nThen, I said, if these and these only are to be used in our songs and\\nmelodies, we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic\\nscale?\\n\\nI suppose not.\\n\\nThen we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners\\nand complex scales, or the makers of any other many-stringed\\ncuriously-harmonised instruments?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nBut what do you say to flute-makers and flute-players? Would you admit\\nthem into our State when you reflect that in this composite use of\\nharmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put\\ntogether; even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute?\\n\\nClearly not.\\n\\nThere remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city, and\\nthe shepherds may have a pipe in the country.\\n\\nThat is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument.\\n\\nThe preferring of Apollo and his instruments to Marsyas and his\\ninstruments is not at all strange, I said.\\n\\nNot at all, he replied.\\n\\nAnd so, by the dog of Egypt, we have been unconsciously purging the\\nState, which not long ago we termed luxurious.\\n\\nAnd we have done wisely, he replied.\\n\\nThen let us now finish the purgation, I said. Next in order to\\nharmonies, rhythms will naturally follow, and they should be subject to\\nthe same rules, for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre,\\nor metres of every kind, but rather to discover what rhythms are the\\nexpressions of a courageous and harmonious life; and when we have found\\nthem, we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like\\nspirit, not the words to the foot and melody. To say what these rhythms\\nare will be your duty—you must teach me them, as you have already\\ntaught me the harmonies.\\n\\nBut, indeed, he replied, I cannot tell you. I only know that there are\\nsome three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are\\nframed, just as in sounds there are four notes (i.e. the four notes of\\nthe tetrachord.) out of which all the harmonies are composed; that is\\nan observation which I have made. But of what sort of lives they are\\nseverally the imitations I am unable to say.\\n\\nThen, I said, we must take Damon into our counsels; and he will tell us\\nwhat rhythms are expressive of meanness, or insolence, or fury, or\\nother unworthiness, and what are to be reserved for the expression of\\nopposite feelings. And I think that I have an indistinct recollection\\nof his mentioning a complex Cretic rhythm; also a dactylic or heroic,\\nand he arranged them in some manner which I do not quite understand,\\nmaking the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot, long and\\nshort alternating; and, unless I am mistaken, he spoke of an iambic as\\nwell as of a trochaic rhythm, and assigned to them short and long\\nquantities. Also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the\\nmovement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm; or perhaps a\\ncombination of the two; for I am not certain what he meant. These\\nmatters, however, as I was saying, had better be referred to Damon\\nhimself, for the analysis of the subject would be difficult, you know?\\n(Socrates expresses himself carelessly in accordance with his assumed\\nignorance of the details of the subject. In the first part of the\\nsentence he appears to be speaking of paeonic rhythms which are in the\\nratio of 3/2; in the second part, of dactylic and anapaestic rhythms,\\nwhich are in the ratio of 1/1; in the last clause, of iambic and\\ntrochaic rhythms, which are in the ratio of 1/2 or 2/1.)\\n\\nRather so, I should say.\\n\\nBut there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace\\nis an effect of good or bad rhythm.\\n\\nNone at all.\\n\\nAnd also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and\\nbad style; and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style;\\nfor our principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the\\nwords, and not the words by them.\\n\\nJust so, he said, they should follow the words.\\n\\nAnd will not the words and the character of the style depend on the\\ntemper of the soul?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd everything else on the style?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThen beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on\\nsimplicity,—I mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered\\nmind and character, not that other simplicity which is only an\\neuphemism for folly?\\n\\nVery true, he replied.\\n\\nAnd if our youth are to do their work in life, must they not make these\\ngraces and harmonies their perpetual aim?\\n\\nThey must.\\n\\nAnd surely the art of the painter and every other creative and\\nconstructive art are full of them,—weaving, embroidery, architecture,\\nand every kind of manufacture; also nature, animal and vegetable,—in\\nall of them there is grace or the absence of grace. And ugliness and\\ndiscord and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill\\nnature, as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and\\nvirtue and bear their likeness.\\n\\nThat is quite true, he said.\\n\\nBut shall our superintendence go no further, and are the poets only to\\nbe required by us to express the image of the good in their works, on\\npain, if they do anything else, of expulsion from our State? Or is the\\nsame control to be extended to other artists, and are they also to be\\nprohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance\\nand meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other\\ncreative arts; and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be\\nprevented from practising his art in our State, lest the taste of our\\ncitizens be corrupted by him? We would not have our guardians grow up\\namid images of moral deformity, as in some noxious pasture, and there\\nbrowse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day, little\\nby little, until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in\\ntheir own soul. Let our artists rather be those who are gifted to\\ndiscern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful; then will our\\nyouth dwell in a land of health, amid fair sights and sounds, and\\nreceive the good in everything; and beauty, the effluence of fair\\nworks, shall flow into the eye and ear, like a health-giving breeze\\nfrom a purer region, and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years\\ninto likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason.\\n\\nThere can be no nobler training than that, he replied.\\n\\nAnd therefore, I said, Glaucon, musical training is a more potent\\ninstrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way\\ninto the inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten,\\nimparting grace, and making the soul of him who is rightly educated\\ngraceful, or of him who is ill-educated ungraceful; and also because he\\nwho has received this true education of the inner being will most\\nshrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature, and with a\\ntrue taste, while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his\\nsoul the good, and becomes noble and good, he will justly blame and\\nhate the bad, now in the days of his youth, even before he is able to\\nknow the reason why; and when reason comes he will recognise and salute\\nthe friend with whom his education has made him long familiar.\\n\\nYes, he said, I quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should\\nbe trained in music and on the grounds which you mention.\\n\\nJust as in learning to read, I said, we were satisfied when we knew the\\nletters of the alphabet, which are very few, in all their recurring\\nsizes and combinations; not slighting them as unimportant whether they\\noccupy a space large or small, but everywhere eager to make them out;\\nand not thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we\\nrecognise them wherever they are found:\\n\\nTrue—\\n\\nOr, as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water, or in a\\nmirror, only when we know the letters themselves; the same art and\\nstudy giving us the knowledge of both:\\n\\nExactly—\\n\\nEven so, as I maintain, neither we nor our guardians, whom we have to\\neducate, can ever become musical until we and they know the essential\\nforms of temperance, courage, liberality, magnificence, and their\\nkindred, as well as the contrary forms, in all their combinations, and\\ncan recognise them and their images wherever they are found, not\\nslighting them either in small things or great, but believing them all\\nto be within the sphere of one art and study.\\n\\nMost assuredly.\\n\\nAnd when a beautiful soul harmonizes with a beautiful form, and the two\\nare cast in one mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him who\\nhas an eye to see it?\\n\\nThe fairest indeed.\\n\\nAnd the fairest is also the loveliest?\\n\\nThat may be assumed.\\n\\nAnd the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the\\nloveliest; but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul?\\n\\nThat is true, he replied, if the deficiency be in his soul; but if\\nthere be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it,\\nand will love all the same.\\n\\nI perceive, I said, that you have or have had experiences of this sort,\\nand I agree. But let me ask you another question: Has excess of\\npleasure any affinity to temperance?\\n\\nHow can that be? he replied; pleasure deprives a man of the use of his\\nfaculties quite as much as pain.\\n\\nOr any affinity to virtue in general?\\n\\nNone whatever.\\n\\nAny affinity to wantonness and intemperance?\\n\\nYes, the greatest.\\n\\nAnd is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love?\\n\\nNo, nor a madder.\\n\\nWhereas true love is a love of beauty and order—temperate and\\nharmonious?\\n\\nQuite true, he said.\\n\\nThen no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true\\nlove?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nThen mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the\\nlover and his beloved; neither of them can have any part in it if their\\nlove is of the right sort?\\n\\nNo, indeed, Socrates, it must never come near them.\\n\\nThen I suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a\\nlaw to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his\\nlove than a father would use to his son, and then only for a noble\\npurpose, and he must first have the other’s consent; and this rule is\\nto limit him in all his intercourse, and he is never to be seen going\\nfurther, or, if he exceeds, he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and\\nbad taste.\\n\\nI quite agree, he said.\\n\\nThus much of music, which makes a fair ending; for what should be the\\nend of music if not the love of beauty?\\n\\nI agree, he said.\\n\\nAfter music comes gymnastic, in which our youth are next to be trained.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nGymnastic as well as music should begin in early years; the training in\\nit should be careful and should continue through life. Now my belief\\nis,—and this is a matter upon which I should like to have your opinion\\nin confirmation of my own, but my own belief is,—not that the good body\\nby any bodily excellence improves the soul, but, on the contrary, that\\nthe good soul, by her own excellence, improves the body as far as this\\nmay be possible. What do you say?\\n\\nYes, I agree.\\n\\nThen, to the mind when adequately trained, we shall be right in handing\\nover the more particular care of the body; and in order to avoid\\nprolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject.\\n\\nVery good.\\n\\nThat they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by\\nus; for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and\\nnot know where in the world he is.\\n\\nYes, he said; that a guardian should require another guardian to take\\ncare of him is ridiculous indeed.\\n\\nBut next, what shall we say of their food; for the men are in training\\nfor the great contest of all—are they not?\\n\\nYes, he said.\\n\\nAnd will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them?\\n\\nWhy not?\\n\\nI am afraid, I said, that a habit of body such as they have is but a\\nsleepy sort of thing, and rather perilous to health. Do you not observe\\nthat these athletes sleep away their lives, and are liable to most\\ndangerous illnesses if they depart, in ever so slight a degree, from\\ntheir customary regimen?\\n\\nYes, I do.\\n\\nThen, I said, a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior\\nathletes, who are to be like wakeful dogs, and to see and hear with the\\nutmost keenness; amid the many changes of water and also of food, of\\nsummer heat and winter cold, which they will have to endure when on a\\ncampaign, they must not be liable to break down in health.\\n\\nThat is my view.\\n\\nThe really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music\\nwhich we were just now describing.\\n\\nHow so?\\n\\nWhy, I conceive that there is a gymnastic which, like our music, is\\nsimple and good; and especially the military gymnastic.\\n\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nMy meaning may be learned from Homer; he, you know, feeds his heroes at\\ntheir feasts, when they are campaigning, on soldiers’ fare; they have\\nno fish, although they are on the shores of the Hellespont, and they\\nare not allowed boiled meats but only roast, which is the food most\\nconvenient for soldiers, requiring only that they should light a fire,\\nand not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd I can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere\\nmentioned in Homer. In proscribing them, however, he is not singular;\\nall professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in\\ngood condition should take nothing of the kind.\\n\\nYes, he said; and knowing this, they are quite right in not taking\\nthem.\\n\\nThen you would not approve of Syracusan dinners, and the refinements of\\nSicilian cookery?\\n\\nI think not.\\n\\nNor, if a man is to be in condition, would you allow him to have a\\nCorinthian girl as his fair friend?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nNeither would you approve of the delicacies, as they are thought, of\\nAthenian confectionary?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nAll such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody and\\nsong composed in the panharmonic style, and in all the rhythms.\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nThere complexity engendered licence, and here disease; whereas\\nsimplicity in music was the parent of temperance in the soul; and\\nsimplicity in gymnastic of health in the body.\\n\\nMost true, he said.\\n\\nBut when intemperance and diseases multiply in a State, halls of\\njustice and medicine are always being opened; and the arts of the\\ndoctor and the lawyer give themselves airs, finding how keen is the\\ninterest which not only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about\\nthem.\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nAnd yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state\\nof education than this, that not only artisans and the meaner sort of\\npeople need the skill of first-rate physicians and judges, but also\\nthose who would profess to have had a liberal education? Is it not\\ndisgraceful, and a great sign of want of good-breeding, that a man\\nshould have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of\\nhis own at home, and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of\\nother men whom he makes lords and judges over him?\\n\\nOf all things, he said, the most disgraceful.\\n\\nWould you say ‘most,’ I replied, when you consider that there is a\\nfurther stage of the evil in which a man is not only a life-long\\nlitigant, passing all his days in the courts, either as plaintiff or\\ndefendant, but is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his\\nlitigiousness; he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty; able to\\ntake every crooked turn, and wriggle into and out of every hole,\\nbending like a withy and getting out of the way of justice: and all for\\nwhat?—in order to gain small points not worth mentioning, he not\\nknowing that so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping\\njudge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing. Is not that still more\\ndisgraceful?\\n\\nYes, he said, that is still more disgraceful.\\n\\nWell, I said, and to require the help of medicine, not when a wound has\\nto be cured, or on occasion of an epidemic, but just because, by\\nindolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing, men fill\\nthemselves with waters and winds, as if their bodies were a marsh,\\ncompelling the ingenious sons of Asclepius to find more names for\\ndiseases, such as flatulence and catarrh; is not this, too, a disgrace?\\n\\nYes, he said, they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names\\nto diseases.\\n\\nYes, I said, and I do not believe that there were any such diseases in\\nthe days of Asclepius; and this I infer from the circumstance that the\\nhero Eurypylus, after he has been wounded in Homer, drinks a posset of\\nPramnian wine well besprinkled with barley-meal and grated cheese,\\nwhich are certainly inflammatory, and yet the sons of Asclepius who\\nwere at the Trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink,\\nor rebuke Patroclus, who is treating his case.\\n\\nWell, he said, that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a\\nperson in his condition.\\n\\nNot so extraordinary, I replied, if you bear in mind that in former\\ndays, as is commonly said, before the time of Herodicus, the guild of\\nAsclepius did not practise our present system of medicine, which may be\\nsaid to educate diseases. But Herodicus, being a trainer, and himself\\nof a sickly constitution, by a combination of training and doctoring\\nfound out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself, and secondly\\nthe rest of the world.\\n\\nHow was that? he said.\\n\\nBy the invention of lingering death; for he had a mortal disease which\\nhe perpetually tended, and as recovery was out of the question, he\\npassed his entire life as a valetudinarian; he could do nothing but\\nattend upon himself, and he was in constant torment whenever he\\ndeparted in anything from his usual regimen, and so dying hard, by the\\nhelp of science he struggled on to old age.\\n\\nA rare reward of his skill!\\n\\nYes, I said; a reward which a man might fairly expect who never\\nunderstood that, if Asclepius did not instruct his descendants in\\nvaletudinarian arts, the omission arose, not from ignorance or\\ninexperience of such a branch of medicine, but because he knew that in\\nall well-ordered states every individual has an occupation to which he\\nmust attend, and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being\\nill. This we remark in the case of the artisan, but, ludicrously\\nenough, do not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort.\\n\\nHow do you mean? he said.\\n\\nI mean this: When a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough\\nand ready cure; an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife,—these\\nare his remedies. And if some one prescribes for him a course of\\ndietetics, and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head, and\\nall that sort of thing, he replies at once that he has no time to be\\nill, and that he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his\\ndisease to the neglect of his customary employment; and therefore\\nbidding good-bye to this sort of physician, he resumes his ordinary\\nhabits, and either gets well and lives and does his business, or, if\\nhis constitution fails, he dies and has no more trouble.\\n\\nYes, he said, and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art\\nof medicine thus far only.\\n\\nHas he not, I said, an occupation; and what profit would there be in\\nhis life if he were deprived of his occupation?\\n\\nQuite true, he said.\\n\\nBut with the rich man this is otherwise; of him we do not say that he\\nhas any specially appointed work which he must perform, if he would\\nlive.\\n\\nHe is generally supposed to have nothing to do.\\n\\nThen you never heard of the saying of Phocylides, that as soon as a man\\nhas a livelihood he should practise virtue?\\n\\nNay, he said, I think that he had better begin somewhat sooner.\\n\\nLet us not have a dispute with him about this, I said; but rather ask\\nourselves: Is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man, or can\\nhe live without it? And if obligatory on him, then let us raise a\\nfurther question, whether this dieting of disorders, which is an\\nimpediment to the application of the mind in carpentering and the\\nmechanical arts, does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of\\nPhocylides?\\n\\nOf that, he replied, there can be no doubt; such excessive care of the\\nbody, when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic, is most inimical to\\nthe practice of virtue.\\n\\nYes, indeed, I replied, and equally incompatible with the management of\\na house, an army, or an office of state; and, what is most important of\\nall, irreconcileable with any kind of study or thought or\\nself-reflection—there is a constant suspicion that headache and\\ngiddiness are to be ascribed to philosophy, and hence all practising or\\nmaking trial of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped; for a\\nman is always fancying that he is being made ill, and is in constant\\nanxiety about the state of his body.\\n\\nYes, likely enough.\\n\\nAnd therefore our politic Asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited\\nthe power of his art only to persons who, being generally of healthy\\nconstitution and habits of life, had a definite ailment; such as these\\nhe cured by purges and operations, and bade them live as usual, herein\\nconsulting the interests of the State; but bodies which disease had\\npenetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure by\\ngradual processes of evacuation and infusion: he did not want to\\nlengthen out good-for-nothing lives, or to have weak fathers begetting\\nweaker sons;—if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had\\nno business to cure him; for such a cure would have been of no use\\neither to himself, or to the State.\\n\\nThen, he said, you regard Asclepius as a statesman.\\n\\nClearly; and his character is further illustrated by his sons. Note\\nthat they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of\\nwhich I am speaking at the siege of Troy: You will remember how, when\\nPandarus wounded Menelaus, they\\n\\n‘Sucked the blood out of the wound, and sprinkled soothing remedies,’\\n\\nbut they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or\\ndrink in the case of Menelaus, any more than in the case of Eurypylus;\\nthe remedies, as they conceived, were enough to heal any man who before\\nhe was wounded was healthy and regular in his habits; and even though\\nhe did happen to drink a posset of Pramnian wine, he might get well all\\nthe same. But they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and\\nintemperate subjects, whose lives were of no use either to themselves\\nor others; the art of medicine was not designed for their good, and\\nthough they were as rich as Midas, the sons of Asclepius would have\\ndeclined to attend them.\\n\\nThey were very acute persons, those sons of Asclepius.\\n\\nNaturally so, I replied. Nevertheless, the tragedians and Pindar\\ndisobeying our behests, although they acknowledge that Asclepius was\\nthe son of Apollo, say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man\\nwho was at the point of death, and for this reason he was struck by\\nlightning. But we, in accordance with the principle already affirmed by\\nus, will not believe them when they tell us both;—if he was the son of\\na god, we maintain that he was not avaricious; or, if he was\\navaricious, he was not the son of a god.\\n\\nAll that, Socrates, is excellent; but I should like to put a question\\nto you: Ought there not to be good physicians in a State, and are not\\nthe best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions\\ngood and bad? and are not the best judges in like manner those who are\\nacquainted with all sorts of moral natures?\\n\\nYes, I said, I too would have good judges and good physicians. But do\\nyou know whom I think good?\\n\\nWill you tell me?\\n\\nI will, if I can. Let me however note that in the same question you\\njoin two things which are not the same.\\n\\nHow so? he asked.\\n\\nWhy, I said, you join physicians and judges. Now the most skilful\\nphysicians are those who, from their youth upwards, have combined with\\nthe knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease; they had\\nbetter not be robust in health, and should have had all manner of\\ndiseases in their own persons. For the body, as I conceive, is not the\\ninstrument with which they cure the body; in that case we could not\\nallow them ever to be or to have been sickly; but they cure the body\\nwith the mind, and the mind which has become and is sick can cure\\nnothing.\\n\\nThat is very true, he said.\\n\\nBut with the judge it is otherwise; since he governs mind by mind; he\\nought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds, and to\\nhave associated with them from youth upwards, and to have gone through\\nthe whole calendar of crime, only in order that he may quickly infer\\nthe crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own\\nself-consciousness; the honourable mind which is to form a healthy\\njudgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits\\nwhen young. And this is the reason why in youth good men often appear\\nto be simple, and are easily practised upon by the dishonest, because\\nthey have no examples of what evil is in their own souls.\\n\\nYes, he said, they are far too apt to be deceived.\\n\\nTherefore, I said, the judge should not be young; he should have\\nlearned to know evil, not from his own soul, but from late and long\\nobservation of the nature of evil in others: knowledge should be his\\nguide, not personal experience.\\n\\nYes, he said, that is the ideal of a judge.\\n\\nYes, I replied, and he will be a good man (which is my answer to your\\nquestion); for he is good who has a good soul. But the cunning and\\nsuspicious nature of which we spoke,—he who has committed many crimes,\\nand fancies himself to be a master in wickedness, when he is amongst\\nhis fellows, is wonderful in the precautions which he takes, because he\\njudges of them by himself: but when he gets into the company of men of\\nvirtue, who have the experience of age, he appears to be a fool again,\\nowing to his unseasonable suspicions; he cannot recognise an honest\\nman, because he has no pattern of honesty in himself; at the same time,\\nas the bad are more numerous than the good, and he meets with them\\noftener, he thinks himself, and is by others thought to be, rather wise\\nthan foolish.\\n\\nMost true, he said.\\n\\nThen the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man, but\\nthe other; for vice cannot know virtue too, but a virtuous nature,\\neducated by time, will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice: the\\nvirtuous, and not the vicious, man has wisdom—in my opinion.\\n\\nAnd in mine also.\\n\\nThis is the sort of medicine, and this is the sort of law, which you\\nwill sanction in your state. They will minister to better natures,\\ngiving health both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in\\ntheir bodies they will leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable\\nsouls they will put an end to themselves.\\n\\nThat is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the State.\\n\\nAnd thus our youth, having been educated only in that simple music\\nwhich, as we said, inspires temperance, will be reluctant to go to law.\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nAnd the musician, who, keeping to the same track, is content to\\npractise the simple gymnastic, will have nothing to do with medicine\\nunless in some extreme case.\\n\\nThat I quite believe.\\n\\nThe very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to\\nstimulate the spirited element of his nature, and not to increase his\\nstrength; he will not, like common athletes, use exercise and regimen\\nto develope his muscles.\\n\\nVery right, he said.\\n\\nNeither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed, as is\\noften supposed, the one for the training of the soul, the other for the\\ntraining of the body.\\n\\nWhat then is the real object of them?\\n\\nI believe, I said, that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the\\nimprovement of the soul.\\n\\nHow can that be? he asked.\\n\\nDid you never observe, I said, the effect on the mind itself of\\nexclusive devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive\\ndevotion to music?\\n\\nIn what way shown? he said.\\n\\nThe one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity, the other of\\nsoftness and effeminacy, I replied.\\n\\nYes, he said, I am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much\\nof a savage, and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond\\nwhat is good for him.\\n\\nYet surely, I said, this ferocity only comes from spirit, which, if\\nrightly educated, would give courage, but, if too much intensified, is\\nliable to become hard and brutal.\\n\\nThat I quite think.\\n\\nOn the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness.\\nAnd this also, when too much indulged, will turn to softness, but, if\\neducated rightly, will be gentle and moderate.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?\\n\\nAssuredly.\\n\\nAnd both should be in harmony?\\n\\nBeyond question.\\n\\nAnd the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd, when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul\\nthrough the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs\\nof which we were just now speaking, and his whole life is passed in\\nwarbling and the delights of song; in the first stage of the process\\nthe passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron, and made\\nuseful, instead of brittle and useless. But, if he carries on the\\nsoftening and soothing process, in the next stage he begins to melt and\\nwaste, until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of\\nhis soul; and he becomes a feeble warrior.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nIf the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is\\nspeedily accomplished, but if he have a good deal, then the power of\\nmusic weakening the spirit renders him excitable;—on the least\\nprovocation he flames up at once, and is speedily extinguished; instead\\nof having spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite\\nimpracticable.\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nAnd so in gymnastics, if a man takes violent exercise and is a great\\nfeeder, and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy, at\\nfirst the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit,\\nand he becomes twice the man that he was.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd what happens? if he do nothing else, and holds no converse with the\\nMuses, does not even that intelligence which there may be in him,\\nhaving no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or\\nculture, grow feeble and dull and blind, his mind never waking up or\\nreceiving nourishment, and his senses not being purged of their mists?\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nAnd he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy, uncivilized, never using\\nthe weapon of persuasion,—he is like a wild beast, all violence and\\nfierceness, and knows no other way of dealing; and he lives in all\\nignorance and evil conditions, and has no sense of propriety and grace.\\n\\nThat is quite true, he said.\\n\\nAnd as there are two principles of human nature, one the spirited and\\nthe other the philosophical, some God, as I should say, has given\\nmankind two arts answering to them (and only indirectly to the soul and\\nbody), in order that these two principles (like the strings of an\\ninstrument) may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly\\nharmonized.\\n\\nThat appears to be the intention.\\n\\nAnd he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions, and\\nbest attempers them to the soul, may be rightly called the true\\nmusician and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the\\nstrings.\\n\\nYou are quite right, Socrates.\\n\\nAnd such a presiding genius will be always required in our State if the\\ngovernment is to last.\\n\\nYes, he will be absolutely necessary.\\n\\nSuch, then, are our principles of nurture and education: Where would be\\nthe use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens,\\nor about their hunting and coursing, their gymnastic and equestrian\\ncontests? For these all follow the general principle, and having found\\nthat, we shall have no difficulty in discovering them.\\n\\nI dare say that there will be no difficulty.\\n\\nVery good, I said; then what is the next question? Must we not ask who\\nare to be rulers and who subjects?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThere can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger.\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nAnd that the best of these must rule.\\n\\nThat is also clear.\\n\\nNow, are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to\\nhusbandry?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd as we are to have the best of guardians for our city, must they not\\nbe those who have most the character of guardians?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd to this end they ought to be wise and efficient, and to have a\\nspecial care of the State?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves?\\n\\nTo be sure.\\n\\nAnd he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the\\nsame interests with himself, and that of which the good or evil fortune\\nis supposed by him at any time most to affect his own?\\n\\nVery true, he replied.\\n\\nThen there must be a selection. Let us note among the guardians those\\nwho in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for\\nthe good of their country, and the greatest repugnance to do what is\\nagainst her interests.\\n\\nThose are the right men.\\n\\nAnd they will have to be watched at every age, in order that we may see\\nwhether they preserve their resolution, and never, under the influence\\neither of force or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of duty\\nto the State.\\n\\nHow cast off? he said.\\n\\nI will explain to you, I replied. A resolution may go out of a man’s\\nmind either with his will or against his will; with his will when he\\ngets rid of a falsehood and learns better, against his will whenever he\\nis deprived of a truth.\\n\\nI understand, he said, the willing loss of a resolution; the meaning of\\nthe unwilling I have yet to learn.\\n\\nWhy, I said, do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good,\\nand willingly of evil? Is not to have lost the truth an evil, and to\\npossess the truth a good? and you would agree that to conceive things\\nas they are is to possess the truth?\\n\\nYes, he replied; I agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived\\nof truth against their will.\\n\\nAnd is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft, or\\nforce, or enchantment?\\n\\nStill, he replied, I do not understand you.\\n\\nI fear that I must have been talking darkly, like the tragedians. I\\nonly mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others\\nforget; argument steals away the hearts of one class, and time of the\\nother; and this I call theft. Now you understand me?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThose again who are forced, are those whom the violence of some pain or\\ngrief compels to change their opinion.\\n\\nI understand, he said, and you are quite right.\\n\\nAnd you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change\\ntheir minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the\\nsterner influence of fear?\\n\\nYes, he said; everything that deceives may be said to enchant.\\n\\nTherefore, as I was just now saying, we must enquire who are the best\\nguardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest of\\nthe State is to be the rule of their lives. We must watch them from\\ntheir youth upwards, and make them perform actions in which they are\\nmost likely to forget or to be deceived, and he who remembers and is\\nnot deceived is to be selected, and he who fails in the trial is to be\\nrejected. That will be the way?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for\\nthem, in which they will be made to give further proof of the same\\nqualities.\\n\\nVery right, he replied.\\n\\nAnd then, I said, we must try them with enchantments—that is the third\\nsort of test—and see what will be their behaviour: like those who take\\ncolts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature, so\\nmust we take our youth amid terrors of some kind, and again pass them\\ninto pleasures, and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in\\nthe furnace, that we may discover whether they are armed against all\\nenchantments, and of a noble bearing always, good guardians of\\nthemselves and of the music which they have learned, and retaining\\nunder all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature, such as\\nwill be most serviceable to the individual and to the State. And he who\\nat every age, as boy and youth and in mature life, has come out of the\\ntrial victorious and pure, shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of\\nthe State; he shall be honoured in life and death, and shall receive\\nsepulture and other memorials of honour, the greatest that we have to\\ngive. But him who fails, we must reject. I am inclined to think that\\nthis is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should be\\nchosen and appointed. I speak generally, and not with any pretension to\\nexactness.\\n\\nAnd, speaking generally, I agree with you, he said.\\n\\nAnd perhaps the word ‘guardian’ in the fullest sense ought to be\\napplied to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign\\nenemies and maintain peace among our citizens at home, that the one may\\nnot have the will, or the others the power, to harm us. The young men\\nwhom we before called guardians may be more properly designated\\nauxiliaries and supporters of the principles of the rulers.\\n\\nI agree with you, he said.\\n\\nHow then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we\\nlately spoke—just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers, if that\\nbe possible, and at any rate the rest of the city?\\n\\nWhat sort of lie? he said.\\n\\nNothing new, I replied; only an old Phoenician tale (Laws) of what has\\noften occurred before now in other places, (as the poets say, and have\\nmade the world believe,) though not in our time, and I do not know\\nwhether such an event could ever happen again, or could now even be\\nmade probable, if it did.\\n\\nHow your words seem to hesitate on your lips!\\n\\nYou will not wonder, I replied, at my hesitation when you have heard.\\n\\nSpeak, he said, and fear not.\\n\\nWell then, I will speak, although I really know not how to look you in\\nthe face, or in what words to utter the audacious fiction, which I\\npropose to communicate gradually, first to the rulers, then to the\\nsoldiers, and lastly to the people. They are to be told that their\\nyouth was a dream, and the education and training which they received\\nfrom us, an appearance only; in reality during all that time they were\\nbeing formed and fed in the womb of the earth, where they themselves\\nand their arms and appurtenances were manufactured; when they were\\ncompleted, the earth, their mother, sent them up; and so, their country\\nbeing their mother and also their nurse, they are bound to advise for\\nher good, and to defend her against attacks, and her citizens they are\\nto regard as children of the earth and their own brothers.\\n\\nYou had good reason, he said, to be ashamed of the lie which you were\\ngoing to tell.\\n\\nTrue, I replied, but there is more coming; I have only told you half.\\nCitizens, we shall say to them in our tale, you are brothers, yet God\\nhas framed you differently. Some of you have the power of command, and\\nin the composition of these he has mingled gold, wherefore also they\\nhave the greatest honour; others he has made of silver, to be\\nauxiliaries; others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has\\ncomposed of brass and iron; and the species will generally be preserved\\nin the children. But as all are of the same original stock, a golden\\nparent will sometimes have a silver son, or a silver parent a golden\\nson. And God proclaims as a first principle to the rulers, and above\\nall else, that there is nothing which they should so anxiously guard,\\nor of which they are to be such good guardians, as of the purity of the\\nrace. They should observe what elements mingle in their offspring; for\\nif the son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and\\niron, then nature orders a transposition of ranks, and the eye of the\\nruler must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend\\nin the scale and become a husbandman or artisan, just as there may be\\nsons of artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are\\nraised to honour, and become guardians or auxiliaries. For an oracle\\nsays that when a man of brass or iron guards the State, it will be\\ndestroyed. Such is the tale; is there any possibility of making our\\ncitizens believe in it?\\n\\nNot in the present generation, he replied; there is no way of\\naccomplishing this; but their sons may be made to believe in the tale,\\nand their sons’ sons, and posterity after them.\\n\\nI see the difficulty, I replied; yet the fostering of such a belief\\nwill make them care more for the city and for one another. Enough,\\nhowever, of the fiction, which may now fly abroad upon the wings of\\nrumour, while we arm our earth-born heroes, and lead them forth under\\nthe command of their rulers. Let them look round and select a spot\\nwhence they can best suppress insurrection, if any prove refractory\\nwithin, and also defend themselves against enemies, who like wolves may\\ncome down on the fold from without; there let them encamp, and when\\nthey have encamped, let them sacrifice to the proper Gods and prepare\\ntheir dwellings.\\n\\nJust so, he said.\\n\\nAnd their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold\\nof winter and the heat of summer.\\n\\nI suppose that you mean houses, he replied.\\n\\nYes, I said; but they must be the houses of soldiers, and not of\\nshop-keepers.\\n\\nWhat is the difference? he said.\\n\\nThat I will endeavour to explain, I replied. To keep watch-dogs, who,\\nfrom want of discipline or hunger, or some evil habit or other, would\\nturn upon the sheep and worry them, and behave not like dogs but\\nwolves, would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd?\\n\\nTruly monstrous, he said.\\n\\nAnd therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries, being\\nstronger than our citizens, may not grow to be too much for them and\\nbecome savage tyrants instead of friends and allies?\\n\\nYes, great care should be taken.\\n\\nAnd would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard?\\n\\nBut they are well-educated already, he replied.\\n\\nI cannot be so confident, my dear Glaucon, I said; I am much more\\ncertain that they ought to be, and that true education, whatever that\\nmay be, will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them\\nin their relations to one another, and to those who are under their\\nprotection.\\n\\nVery true, he replied.\\n\\nAnd not only their education, but their habitations, and all that\\nbelongs to them, should be such as will neither impair their virtue as\\nguardians, nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens. Any man of\\nsense must acknowledge that.\\n\\nHe must.\\n\\nThen now let us consider what will be their way of life, if they are to\\nrealize our idea of them. In the first place, none of them should have\\nany property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary; neither\\nshould they have a private house or store closed against any one who\\nhas a mind to enter; their provisions should be only such as are\\nrequired by trained warriors, who are men of temperance and courage;\\nthey should agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay,\\nenough to meet the expenses of the year and no more; and they will go\\nto mess and live together like soldiers in a camp. Gold and silver we\\nwill tell them that they have from God; the diviner metal is within\\nthem, and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current\\namong men, and ought not to pollute the divine by any such earthly\\nadmixture; for that commoner metal has been the source of many unholy\\ndeeds, but their own is undefiled. And they alone of all the citizens\\nmay not touch or handle silver or gold, or be under the same roof with\\nthem, or wear them, or drink from them. And this will be their\\nsalvation, and they will be the saviours of the State. But should they\\never acquire homes or lands or moneys of their own, they will become\\nhousekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians, enemies and tyrants\\ninstead of allies of the other citizens; hating and being hated,\\nplotting and being plotted against, they will pass their whole life in\\nmuch greater terror of internal than of external enemies, and the hour\\nof ruin, both to themselves and to the rest of the State, will be at\\nhand. For all which reasons may we not say that thus shall our State be\\nordered, and that these shall be the regulations appointed by us for\\nguardians concerning their houses and all other matters?\\n\\nYes, said Glaucon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n BOOK IV.\\n\\n\\nHere Adeimantus interposed a question: How would you answer, Socrates,\\nsaid he, if a person were to say that you are making these people\\nmiserable, and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness; the\\ncity in fact belongs to them, but they are none the better for it;\\nwhereas other men acquire lands, and build large and handsome houses,\\nand have everything handsome about them, offering sacrifices to the\\ngods on their own account, and practising hospitality; moreover, as you\\nwere saying just now, they have gold and silver, and all that is usual\\namong the favourites of fortune; but our poor citizens are no better\\nthan mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting\\nguard?\\n\\nYes, I said; and you may add that they are only fed, and not paid in\\naddition to their food, like other men; and therefore they cannot, if\\nthey would, take a journey of pleasure; they have no money to spend on\\na mistress or any other luxurious fancy, which, as the world goes, is\\nthought to be happiness; and many other accusations of the same nature\\nmight be added.\\n\\nBut, said he, let us suppose all this to be included in the charge.\\n\\nYou mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nIf we proceed along the old path, my belief, I said, is that we shall\\nfind the answer. And our answer will be that, even as they are, our\\nguardians may very likely be the happiest of men; but that our aim in\\nfounding the State was not the disproportionate happiness of any one\\nclass, but the greatest happiness of the whole; we thought that in a\\nState which is ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should\\nbe most likely to find justice, and in the ill-ordered State injustice:\\nand, having found them, we might then decide which of the two is the\\nhappier. At present, I take it, we are fashioning the happy State, not\\npiecemeal, or with a view of making a few happy citizens, but as a\\nwhole; and by-and-by we will proceed to view the opposite kind of\\nState. Suppose that we were painting a statue, and some one came up to\\nus and said, Why do you not put the most beautiful colours on the most\\nbeautiful parts of the body—the eyes ought to be purple, but you have\\nmade them black—to him we might fairly answer, Sir, you would not\\nsurely have us beautify the eyes to such a degree that they are no\\nlonger eyes; consider rather whether, by giving this and the other\\nfeatures their due proportion, we make the whole beautiful. And so I\\nsay to you, do not compel us to assign to the guardians a sort of\\nhappiness which will make them anything but guardians; for we too can\\nclothe our husbandmen in royal apparel, and set crowns of gold on their\\nheads, and bid them till the ground as much as they like, and no more.\\nOur potters also might be allowed to repose on couches, and feast by\\nthe fireside, passing round the winecup, while their wheel is\\nconveniently at hand, and working at pottery only as much as they like;\\nin this way we might make every class happy—and then, as you imagine,\\nthe whole State would be happy. But do not put this idea into our\\nheads; for, if we listen to you, the husbandman will be no longer a\\nhusbandman, the potter will cease to be a potter, and no one will have\\nthe character of any distinct class in the State. Now this is not of\\nmuch consequence where the corruption of society, and pretension to be\\nwhat you are not, is confined to cobblers; but when the guardians of\\nthe laws and of the government are only seeming and not real guardians,\\nthen see how they turn the State upside down; and on the other hand\\nthey alone have the power of giving order and happiness to the State.\\nWe mean our guardians to be true saviours and not the destroyers of the\\nState, whereas our opponent is thinking of peasants at a festival, who\\nare enjoying a life of revelry, not of citizens who are doing their\\nduty to the State. But, if so, we mean different things, and he is\\nspeaking of something which is not a State. And therefore we must\\nconsider whether in appointing our guardians we would look to their\\ngreatest happiness individually, or whether this principle of happiness\\ndoes not rather reside in the State as a whole. But if the latter be\\nthe truth, then the guardians and auxiliaries, and all others equally\\nwith them, must be compelled or induced to do their own work in the\\nbest way. And thus the whole State will grow up in a noble order, and\\nthe several classes will receive the proportion of happiness which\\nnature assigns to them.\\n\\nI think that you are quite right.\\n\\nI wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to me.\\n\\nWhat may that be?\\n\\nThere seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts.\\n\\nWhat are they?\\n\\nWealth, I said, and poverty.\\n\\nHow do they act?\\n\\nThe process is as follows: When a potter becomes rich, will he, think\\nyou, any longer take the same pains with his art?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nHe will grow more and more indolent and careless?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd the result will be that he becomes a worse potter?\\n\\nYes; he greatly deteriorates.\\n\\nBut, on the other hand, if he has no money, and cannot provide himself\\nwith tools or instruments, he will not work equally well himself, nor\\nwill he teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well.\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nThen, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workmen and\\ntheir work are equally liable to degenerate?\\n\\nThat is evident.\\n\\nHere, then, is a discovery of new evils, I said, against which the\\nguardians will have to watch, or they will creep into the city\\nunobserved.\\n\\nWhat evils?\\n\\nWealth, I said, and poverty; the one is the parent of luxury and\\nindolence, and the other of meanness and viciousness, and both of\\ndiscontent.\\n\\nThat is very true, he replied; but still I should like to know,\\nSocrates, how our city will be able to go to war, especially against an\\nenemy who is rich and powerful, if deprived of the sinews of war.\\n\\nThere would certainly be a difficulty, I replied, in going to war with\\none such enemy; but there is no difficulty where there are two of them.\\n\\nHow so? he asked.\\n\\nIn the first place, I said, if we have to fight, our side will be\\ntrained warriors fighting against an army of rich men.\\n\\nThat is true, he said.\\n\\nAnd do you not suppose, Adeimantus, that a single boxer who was perfect\\nin his art would easily be a match for two stout and well-to-do\\ngentlemen who were not boxers?\\n\\nHardly, if they came upon him at once.\\n\\nWhat, now, I said, if he were able to run away and then turn and strike\\nat the one who first came up? And supposing he were to do this several\\ntimes under the heat of a scorching sun, might he not, being an expert,\\noverturn more than one stout personage?\\n\\nCertainly, he said, there would be nothing wonderful in that.\\n\\nAnd yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the science and\\npractise of boxing than they have in military qualities.\\n\\nLikely enough.\\n\\nThen we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or\\nthree times their own number?\\n\\nI agree with you, for I think you right.\\n\\nAnd suppose that, before engaging, our citizens send an embassy to one\\nof the two cities, telling them what is the truth: Silver and gold we\\nneither have nor are permitted to have, but you may; do you therefore\\ncome and help us in war, and take the spoils of the other city: Who, on\\nhearing these words, would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs,\\nrather than, with the dogs on their side, against fat and tender sheep?\\n\\nThat is not likely; and yet there might be a danger to the poor State\\nif the wealth of many States were to be gathered into one.\\n\\nBut how simple of you to use the term State at all of any but our own!\\n\\nWhy so?\\n\\nYou ought to speak of other States in the plural number; not one of\\nthem is a city, but many cities, as they say in the game. For indeed\\nany city, however small, is in fact divided into two, one the city of\\nthe poor, the other of the rich; these are at war with one another; and\\nin either there are many smaller divisions, and you would be altogether\\nbeside the mark if you treated them all as a single State. But if you\\ndeal with them as many, and give the wealth or power or persons of the\\none to the others, you will always have a great many friends and not\\nmany enemies. And your State, while the wise order which has now been\\nprescribed continues to prevail in her, will be the greatest of States,\\nI do not mean to say in reputation or appearance, but in deed and\\ntruth, though she number not more than a thousand defenders. A single\\nState which is her equal you will hardly find, either among Hellenes or\\nbarbarians, though many that appear to be as great and many times\\ngreater.\\n\\nThat is most true, he said.\\n\\nAnd what, I said, will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when\\nthey are considering the size of the State and the amount of territory\\nwhich they are to include, and beyond which they will not go?\\n\\nWhat limit would you propose?\\n\\nI would allow the State to increase so far as is consistent with unity;\\nthat, I think, is the proper limit.\\n\\nVery good, he said.\\n\\nHere then, I said, is another order which will have to be conveyed to\\nour guardians: Let our city be accounted neither large nor small, but\\none and self-sufficing.\\n\\nAnd surely, said he, this is not a very severe order which we impose\\nupon them.\\n\\nAnd the other, said I, of which we were speaking before is lighter\\nstill,—I mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians when\\ninferior, and of elevating into the rank of guardians the offspring of\\nthe lower classes, when naturally superior. The intention was, that, in\\nthe case of the citizens generally, each individual should be put to\\nthe use for which nature intended him, one to one work, and then every\\nman would do his own business, and be one and not many; and so the\\nwhole city would be one and not many.\\n\\nYes, he said; that is not so difficult.\\n\\nThe regulations which we are prescribing, my good Adeimantus, are not,\\nas might be supposed, a number of great principles, but trifles all, if\\ncare be taken, as the saying is, of the one great thing,—a thing,\\nhowever, which I would rather call, not great, but sufficient for our\\npurpose.\\n\\nWhat may that be? he asked.\\n\\nEducation, I said, and nurture: If our citizens are well educated, and\\ngrow into sensible men, they will easily see their way through all\\nthese, as well as other matters which I omit; such, for example, as\\nmarriage, the possession of women and the procreation of children,\\nwhich will all follow the general principle that friends have all\\nthings in common, as the proverb says.\\n\\nThat will be the best way of settling them.\\n\\nAlso, I said, the State, if once started well, moves with accumulating\\nforce like a wheel. For good nurture and education implant good\\nconstitutions, and these good constitutions taking root in a good\\neducation improve more and more, and this improvement affects the breed\\nin man as in other animals.\\n\\nVery possibly, he said.\\n\\nThen to sum up: This is the point to which, above all, the attention of\\nour rulers should be directed,—that music and gymnastic be preserved in\\ntheir original form, and no innovation made. They must do their utmost\\nto maintain them intact. And when any one says that mankind most regard\\n\\n‘The newest song which the singers have,’\\n\\nthey will be afraid that he may be praising, not new songs, but a new\\nkind of song; and this ought not to be praised, or conceived to be the\\nmeaning of the poet; for any musical innovation is full of danger to\\nthe whole State, and ought to be prohibited. So Damon tells me, and I\\ncan quite believe him;—he says that when modes of music change, the\\nfundamental laws of the State always change with them.\\n\\nYes, said Adeimantus; and you may add my suffrage to Damon’s and your\\nown.\\n\\nThen, I said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress\\nin music?\\n\\nYes, he said; the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals in.\\n\\nYes, I replied, in the form of amusement; and at first sight it appears\\nharmless.\\n\\nWhy, yes, he said, and there is no harm; were it not that little by\\nlittle this spirit of licence, finding a home, imperceptibly penetrates\\ninto manners and customs; whence, issuing with greater force, it\\ninvades contracts between man and man, and from contracts goes on to\\nlaws and constitutions, in utter recklessness, ending at last,\\nSocrates, by an overthrow of all rights, private as well as public.\\n\\nIs that true? I said.\\n\\nThat is my belief, he replied.\\n\\nThen, as I was saying, our youth should be trained from the first in a\\nstricter system, for if amusements become lawless, and the youths\\nthemselves become lawless, they can never grow up into well-conducted\\nand virtuous citizens.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nAnd when they have made a good beginning in play, and by the help of\\nmusic have gained the habit of good order, then this habit of order, in\\na manner how unlike the lawless play of the others! will accompany them\\nin all their actions and be a principle of growth to them, and if there\\nbe any fallen places in the State will raise them up again.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nThus educated, they will invent for themselves any lesser rules which\\ntheir predecessors have altogether neglected.\\n\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nI mean such things as these:—when the young are to be silent before\\ntheir elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and\\nmaking them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes\\nare to be worn; the mode of dressing the hair; deportment and manners\\nin general. You would agree with me?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nBut there is, I think, small wisdom in legislating about such\\nmatters,—I doubt if it is ever done; nor are any precise written\\nenactments about them likely to be lasting.\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nIt would seem, Adeimantus, that the direction in which education starts\\na man, will determine his future life. Does not like always attract\\nlike?\\n\\nTo be sure.\\n\\nUntil some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good, and\\nmay be the reverse of good?\\n\\nThat is not to be denied.\\n\\nAnd for this reason, I said, I shall not attempt to legislate further\\nabout them.\\n\\nNaturally enough, he replied.\\n\\nWell, and about the business of the agora, and the ordinary dealings\\nbetween man and man, or again about agreements with artisans; about\\ninsult and injury, or the commencement of actions, and the appointment\\nof juries, what would you say? there may also arise questions about any\\nimpositions and exactions of market and harbour dues which may be\\nrequired, and in general about the regulations of markets, police,\\nharbours, and the like. But, oh heavens! shall we condescend to\\nlegislate on any of these particulars?\\n\\nI think, he said, that there is no need to impose laws about them on\\ngood men; what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough\\nfor themselves.\\n\\nYes, I said, my friend, if God will only preserve to them the laws\\nwhich we have given them.\\n\\nAnd without divine help, said Adeimantus, they will go on for ever\\nmaking and mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining\\nperfection.\\n\\nYou would compare them, I said, to those invalids who, having no\\nself-restraint, will not leave off their habits of intemperance?\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nYes, I said; and what a delightful life they lead! they are always\\ndoctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders, and always\\nfancying that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises\\nthem to try.\\n\\nSuch cases are very common, he said, with invalids of this sort.\\n\\nYes, I replied; and the charming thing is that they deem him their\\nworst enemy who tells them the truth, which is simply that, unless they\\ngive up eating and drinking and wenching and idling, neither drug nor\\ncautery nor spell nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail.\\n\\nCharming! he replied. I see nothing charming in going into a passion\\nwith a man who tells you what is right.\\n\\nThese gentlemen, I said, do not seem to be in your good graces.\\n\\nAssuredly not.\\n\\nNor would you praise the behaviour of States which act like the men\\nwhom I was just now describing. For are there not ill-ordered States in\\nwhich the citizens are forbidden under pain of death to alter the\\nconstitution; and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under\\nthis regime and indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in\\nanticipating and gratifying their humours is held to be a great and\\ngood statesman—do not these States resemble the persons whom I was\\ndescribing?\\n\\nYes, he said; the States are as bad as the men; and I am very far from\\npraising them.\\n\\nBut do you not admire, I said, the coolness and dexterity of these\\nready ministers of political corruption?\\n\\nYes, he said, I do; but not of all of them, for there are some whom the\\napplause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are\\nreally statesmen, and these are not much to be admired.\\n\\nWhat do you mean? I said; you should have more feeling for them. When a\\nman cannot measure, and a great many others who cannot measure declare\\nthat he is four cubits high, can he help believing what they say?\\n\\nNay, he said, certainly not in that case.\\n\\nWell, then, do not be angry with them; for are they not as good as a\\nplay, trying their hand at paltry reforms such as I was describing;\\nthey are always fancying that by legislation they will make an end of\\nfrauds in contracts, and the other rascalities which I was mentioning,\\nnot knowing that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra?\\n\\nYes, he said; that is just what they are doing.\\n\\nI conceive, I said, that the true legislator will not trouble himself\\nwith this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the\\nconstitution either in an ill-ordered or in a well-ordered State; for\\nin the former they are quite useless, and in the latter there will be\\nno difficulty in devising them; and many of them will naturally flow\\nout of our previous regulations.\\n\\nWhat, then, he said, is still remaining to us of the work of\\nlegislation?\\n\\nNothing to us, I replied; but to Apollo, the God of Delphi, there\\nremains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of\\nall.\\n\\nWhich are they? he said.\\n\\nThe institution of temples and sacrifices, and the entire service of\\ngods, demigods, and heroes; also the ordering of the repositories of\\nthe dead, and the rites which have to be observed by him who would\\npropitiate the inhabitants of the world below. These are matters of\\nwhich we are ignorant ourselves, and as founders of a city we should be\\nunwise in trusting them to any interpreter but our ancestral deity. He\\nis the god who sits in the centre, on the navel of the earth, and he is\\nthe interpreter of religion to all mankind.\\n\\nYou are right, and we will do as you propose.\\n\\nBut where, amid all this, is justice? son of Ariston, tell me where.\\nNow that our city has been made habitable, light a candle and search,\\nand get your brother and Polemarchus and the rest of our friends to\\nhelp, and let us see where in it we can discover justice and where\\ninjustice, and in what they differ from one another, and which of them\\nthe man who would be happy should have for his portion, whether seen or\\nunseen by gods and men.\\n\\nNonsense, said Glaucon: did you not promise to search yourself, saying\\nthat for you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety?\\n\\nI do not deny that I said so, and as you remind me, I will be as good\\nas my word; but you must join.\\n\\nWe will, he replied.\\n\\nWell, then, I hope to make the discovery in this way: I mean to begin\\nwith the assumption that our State, if rightly ordered, is perfect.\\n\\nThat is most certain.\\n\\nAnd being perfect, is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and\\njust.\\n\\nThat is likewise clear.\\n\\nAnd whichever of these qualities we find in the State, the one which is\\nnot found will be the residue?\\n\\nVery good.\\n\\nIf there were four things, and we were searching for one of them,\\nwherever it might be, the one sought for might be known to us from the\\nfirst, and there would be no further trouble; or we might know the\\nother three first, and then the fourth would clearly be the one left.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nAnd is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues, which are\\nalso four in number?\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nFirst among the virtues found in the State, wisdom comes into view, and\\nin this I detect a certain peculiarity.\\n\\nWhat is that?\\n\\nThe State which we have been describing is said to be wise as being\\ngood in counsel?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance,\\nbut by knowledge, do men counsel well?\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nAnd the kinds of knowledge in a State are many and diverse?\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nThere is the knowledge of the carpenter; but is that the sort of\\nknowledge which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel?\\n\\nCertainly not; that would only give a city the reputation of skill in\\ncarpentering.\\n\\nThen a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge\\nwhich counsels for the best about wooden implements?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nNor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, I said,\\nnor as possessing any other similar knowledge?\\n\\nNot by reason of any of them, he said.\\n\\nNor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth; that would\\ngive the city the name of agricultural?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nWell, I said, and is there any knowledge in our recently-founded State\\namong any of the citizens which advises, not about any particular thing\\nin the State, but about the whole, and considers how a State can best\\ndeal with itself and with other States?\\n\\nThere certainly is.\\n\\nAnd what is this knowledge, and among whom is it found? I asked.\\n\\nIt is the knowledge of the guardians, he replied, and is found among\\nthose whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians.\\n\\nAnd what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this\\nsort of knowledge?\\n\\nThe name of good in counsel and truly wise.\\n\\nAnd will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more\\nsmiths?\\n\\nThe smiths, he replied, will be far more numerous.\\n\\nWill not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a\\nname from the profession of some kind of knowledge?\\n\\nMuch the smallest.\\n\\nAnd so by reason of the smallest part or class, and of the knowledge\\nwhich resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself, the whole\\nState, being thus constituted according to nature, will be wise; and\\nthis, which has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom, has been\\nordained by nature to be of all classes the least.\\n\\nMost true.\\n\\nThus, then, I said, the nature and place in the State of one of the\\nfour virtues has somehow or other been discovered.\\n\\nAnd, in my humble opinion, very satisfactorily discovered, he replied.\\n\\nAgain, I said, there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of courage,\\nand in what part that quality resides which gives the name of\\ncourageous to the State.\\n\\nHow do you mean?\\n\\nWhy, I said, every one who calls any State courageous or cowardly, will\\nbe thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the State’s\\nbehalf.\\n\\nNo one, he replied, would ever think of any other.\\n\\nThe rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly, but\\ntheir courage or cowardice will not, as I conceive, have the effect of\\nmaking the city either the one or the other.\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nThe city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which\\npreserves under all circumstances that opinion about the nature of\\nthings to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator\\neducated them; and this is what you term courage.\\n\\nI should like to hear what you are saying once more, for I do not think\\nthat I perfectly understand you.\\n\\nI mean that courage is a kind of salvation.\\n\\nSalvation of what?\\n\\nOf the opinion respecting things to be feared, what they are and of\\nwhat nature, which the law implants through education; and I mean by\\nthe words ‘under all circumstances’ to intimate that in pleasure or in\\npain, or under the influence of desire or fear, a man preserves, and\\ndoes not lose this opinion. Shall I give you an illustration?\\n\\nIf you please.\\n\\nYou know, I said, that dyers, when they want to dye wool for making the\\ntrue sea-purple, begin by selecting their white colour first; this they\\nprepare and dress with much care and pains, in order that the white\\nground may take the purple hue in full perfection. The dyeing then\\nproceeds; and whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast colour,\\nand no washing either with lyes or without them can take away the\\nbloom. But, when the ground has not been duly prepared, you will have\\nnoticed how poor is the look either of purple or of any other colour.\\n\\nYes, he said; I know that they have a washed-out and ridiculous\\nappearance.\\n\\nThen now, I said, you will understand what our object was in selecting\\nour soldiers, and educating them in music and gymnastic; we were\\ncontriving influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the\\nlaws in perfection, and the colour of their opinion about dangers and\\nof every other opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture and\\ntraining, not to be washed away by such potent lyes as\\npleasure—mightier agent far in washing the soul than any soda or lye;\\nor by sorrow, fear, and desire, the mightiest of all other solvents.\\nAnd this sort of universal saving power of true opinion in conformity\\nwith law about real and false dangers I call and maintain to be\\ncourage, unless you disagree.\\n\\nBut I agree, he replied; for I suppose that you mean to exclude mere\\nuninstructed courage, such as that of a wild beast or of a slave—this,\\nin your opinion, is not the courage which the law ordains, and ought to\\nhave another name.\\n\\nMost certainly.\\n\\nThen I may infer courage to be such as you describe?\\n\\nWhy, yes, said I, you may, and if you add the words ‘of a citizen,’ you\\nwill not be far wrong;—hereafter, if you like, we will carry the\\nexamination further, but at present we are seeking not for courage but\\njustice; and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough.\\n\\nYou are right, he replied.\\n\\nTwo virtues remain to be discovered in the State—first, temperance, and\\nthen justice which is the end of our search.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nNow, can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance?\\n\\nI do not know how that can be accomplished, he said, nor do I desire\\nthat justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of;\\nand therefore I wish that you would do me the favour of considering\\ntemperance first.\\n\\nCertainly, I replied, I should not be justified in refusing your\\nrequest.\\n\\nThen consider, he said.\\n\\nYes, I replied; I will; and as far as I can at present see, the virtue\\nof temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than the\\npreceding.\\n\\nHow so? he asked.\\n\\nTemperance, I replied, is the ordering or controlling of certain\\npleasures and desires; this is curiously enough implied in the saying\\nof ‘a man being his own master;’ and other traces of the same notion\\nmay be found in language.\\n\\nNo doubt, he said.\\n\\nThere is something ridiculous in the expression ‘master of himself;’\\nfor the master is also the servant and the servant the master; and in\\nall these modes of speaking the same person is denoted.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThe meaning is, I believe, that in the human soul there is a better and\\nalso a worse principle; and when the better has the worse under\\ncontrol, then a man is said to be master of himself; and this is a term\\nof praise: but when, owing to evil education or association, the better\\nprinciple, which is also the smaller, is overwhelmed by the greater\\nmass of the worse—in this case he is blamed and is called the slave of\\nself and unprincipled.\\n\\nYes, there is reason in that.\\n\\nAnd now, I said, look at our newly-created State, and there you will\\nfind one of these two conditions realized; for the State, as you will\\nacknowledge, may be justly called master of itself, if the words\\n‘temperance’ and ‘self-mastery’ truly express the rule of the better\\npart over the worse.\\n\\nYes, he said, I see that what you say is true.\\n\\nLet me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires\\nand pains are generally found in children and women and servants, and\\nin the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class.\\n\\nCertainly, he said.\\n\\nWhereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason, and are\\nunder the guidance of mind and true opinion, are to be found only in a\\nfew, and those the best born and best educated.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nThese two, as you may perceive, have a place in our State; and the\\nmeaner desires of the many are held down by the virtuous desires and\\nwisdom of the few.\\n\\nThat I perceive, he said.\\n\\nThen if there be any city which may be described as master of its own\\npleasures and desires, and master of itself, ours may claim such a\\ndesignation?\\n\\nCertainly, he replied.\\n\\nIt may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd if there be any State in which rulers and subjects will be agreed\\nas to the question who are to rule, that again will be our State?\\n\\nUndoubtedly.\\n\\nAnd the citizens being thus agreed among themselves, in which class\\nwill temperance be found—in the rulers or in the subjects?\\n\\nIn both, as I should imagine, he replied.\\n\\nDo you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance\\nwas a sort of harmony?\\n\\nWhy so?\\n\\nWhy, because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom, each of which\\nresides in a part only, the one making the State wise and the other\\nvaliant; not so temperance, which extends to the whole, and runs\\nthrough all the notes of the scale, and produces a harmony of the\\nweaker and the stronger and the middle class, whether you suppose them\\nto be stronger or weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth, or\\nanything else. Most truly then may we deem temperance to be the\\nagreement of the naturally superior and inferior, as to the right to\\nrule of either, both in states and individuals.\\n\\nI entirely agree with you.\\n\\nAnd so, I said, we may consider three out of the four virtues to have\\nbeen discovered in our State. The last of those qualities which make a\\nstate virtuous must be justice, if we only knew what that was.\\n\\nThe inference is obvious.\\n\\nThe time then has arrived, Glaucon, when, like huntsmen, we should\\nsurround the cover, and look sharp that justice does not steal away,\\nand pass out of sight and escape us; for beyond a doubt she is\\nsomewhere in this country: watch therefore and strive to catch a sight\\nof her, and if you see her first, let me know.\\n\\nWould that I could! but you should regard me rather as a follower who\\nhas just eyes enough to see what you show him—that is about as much as\\nI am good for.\\n\\nOffer up a prayer with me and follow.\\n\\nI will, but you must show me the way.\\n\\nHere is no path, I said, and the wood is dark and perplexing; still we\\nmust push on.\\n\\nLet us push on.\\n\\nHere I saw something: Halloo! I said, I begin to perceive a track, and\\nI believe that the quarry will not escape.\\n\\nGood news, he said.\\n\\nTruly, I said, we are stupid fellows.\\n\\nWhy so?\\n\\nWhy, my good sir, at the beginning of our enquiry, ages ago, there was\\njustice tumbling out at our feet, and we never saw her; nothing could\\nbe more ridiculous. Like people who go about looking for what they have\\nin their hands—that was the way with us—we looked not at what we were\\nseeking, but at what was far off in the distance; and therefore, I\\nsuppose, we missed her.\\n\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nI mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking\\nof justice, and have failed to recognise her.\\n\\nI grow impatient at the length of your exordium.\\n\\nWell then, tell me, I said, whether I am right or not: You remember the\\noriginal principle which we were always laying down at the foundation\\nof the State, that one man should practise one thing only, the thing to\\nwhich his nature was best adapted;—now justice is this principle or a\\npart of it.\\n\\nYes, we often said that one man should do one thing only.\\n\\nFurther, we affirmed that justice was doing one’s own business, and not\\nbeing a busybody; we said so again and again, and many others have said\\nthe same to us.\\n\\nYes, we said so.\\n\\nThen to do one’s own business in a certain way may be assumed to be\\njustice. Can you tell me whence I derive this inference?\\n\\nI cannot, but I should like to be told.\\n\\nBecause I think that this is the only virtue which remains in the State\\nwhen the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom are\\nabstracted; and, that this is the ultimate cause and condition of the\\nexistence of all of them, and while remaining in them is also their\\npreservative; and we were saying that if the three were discovered by\\nus, justice would be the fourth or remaining one.\\n\\nThat follows of necessity.\\n\\nIf we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its\\npresence contributes most to the excellence of the State, whether the\\nagreement of rulers and subjects, or the preservation in the soldiers\\nof the opinion which the law ordains about the true nature of dangers,\\nor wisdom and watchfulness in the rulers, or whether this other which I\\nam mentioning, and which is found in children and women, slave and\\nfreeman, artisan, ruler, subject,—the quality, I mean, of every one\\ndoing his own work, and not being a busybody, would claim the palm—the\\nquestion is not so easily answered.\\n\\nCertainly, he replied, there would be a difficulty in saying which.\\n\\nThen the power of each individual in the State to do his own work\\nappears to compete with the other political virtues, wisdom,\\ntemperance, courage.\\n\\nYes, he said.\\n\\nAnd the virtue which enters into this competition is justice?\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nLet us look at the question from another point of view: Are not the\\nrulers in a State those to whom you would entrust the office of\\ndetermining suits at law?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither\\ntake what is another’s, nor be deprived of what is his own?\\n\\nYes; that is their principle.\\n\\nWhich is a just principle?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThen on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and\\ndoing what is a man’s own, and belongs to him?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nThink, now, and say whether you agree with me or not. Suppose a\\ncarpenter to be doing the business of a cobbler, or a cobbler of a\\ncarpenter; and suppose them to exchange their implements or their\\nduties, or the same person to be doing the work of both, or whatever be\\nthe change; do you think that any great harm would result to the State?\\n\\nNot much.\\n\\nBut when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a\\ntrader, having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number\\nof his followers, or any like advantage, attempts to force his way into\\nthe class of warriors, or a warrior into that of legislators and\\nguardians, for which he is unfitted, and either to take the implements\\nor the duties of the other; or when one man is trader, legislator, and\\nwarrior all in one, then I think you will agree with me in saying that\\nthis interchange and this meddling of one with another is the ruin of\\nthe State.\\n\\nMost true.\\n\\nSeeing then, I said, that there are three distinct classes, any\\nmeddling of one with another, or the change of one into another, is the\\ngreatest harm to the State, and may be most justly termed evil-doing?\\n\\nPrecisely.\\n\\nAnd the greatest degree of evil-doing to one’s own city would be termed\\nby you injustice?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThis then is injustice; and on the other hand when the trader, the\\nauxiliary, and the guardian each do their own business, that is\\njustice, and will make the city just.\\n\\nI agree with you.\\n\\nWe will not, I said, be over-positive as yet; but if, on trial, this\\nconception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in the\\nState, there will be no longer any room for doubt; if it be not\\nverified, we must have a fresh enquiry. First let us complete the old\\ninvestigation, which we began, as you remember, under the impression\\nthat, if we could previously examine justice on the larger scale, there\\nwould be less difficulty in discerning her in the individual. That\\nlarger example appeared to be the State, and accordingly we constructed\\nas good a one as we could, knowing well that in the good State justice\\nwould be found. Let the discovery which we made be now applied to the\\nindividual—if they agree, we shall be satisfied; or, if there be a\\ndifference in the individual, we will come back to the State and have\\nanother trial of the theory. The friction of the two when rubbed\\ntogether may possibly strike a light in which justice will shine forth,\\nand the vision which is then revealed we will fix in our souls.\\n\\nThat will be in regular course; let us do as you say.\\n\\nI proceeded to ask: When two things, a greater and less, are called by\\nthe same name, are they like or unlike in so far as they are called the\\nsame?\\n\\nLike, he replied.\\n\\nThe just man then, if we regard the idea of justice only, will be like\\nthe just State?\\n\\nHe will.\\n\\nAnd a State was thought by us to be just when the three classes in the\\nState severally did their own business; and also thought to be\\ntemperate and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections\\nand qualities of these same classes?\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nAnd so of the individual; we may assume that he has the same three\\nprinciples in his own soul which are found in the State; and he may be\\nrightly described in the same terms, because he is affected in the same\\nmanner?\\n\\nCertainly, he said.\\n\\nOnce more then, O my friend, we have alighted upon an easy\\nquestion—whether the soul has these three principles or not?\\n\\nAn easy question! Nay, rather, Socrates, the proverb holds that hard is\\nthe good.\\n\\nVery true, I said; and I do not think that the method which we are\\nemploying is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question;\\nthe true method is another and a longer one. Still we may arrive at a\\nsolution not below the level of the previous enquiry.\\n\\nMay we not be satisfied with that? he said;—under the circumstances, I\\nam quite content.\\n\\nI too, I replied, shall be extremely well satisfied.\\n\\nThen faint not in pursuing the speculation, he said.\\n\\nMust we not acknowledge, I said, that in each of us there are the same\\nprinciples and habits which there are in the State; and that from the\\nindividual they pass into the State?—how else can they come there? Take\\nthe quality of passion or spirit;—it would be ridiculous to imagine\\nthat this quality, when found in States, is not derived from the\\nindividuals who are supposed to possess it, e.g. the Thracians,\\nScythians, and in general the northern nations; and the same may be\\nsaid of the love of knowledge, which is the special characteristic of\\nour part of the world, or of the love of money, which may, with equal\\ntruth, be attributed to the Phoenicians and Egyptians.\\n\\nExactly so, he said.\\n\\nThere is no difficulty in understanding this.\\n\\nNone whatever.\\n\\nBut the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether\\nthese principles are three or one; whether, that is to say, we learn\\nwith one part of our nature, are angry with another, and with a third\\npart desire the satisfaction of our natural appetites; or whether the\\nwhole soul comes into play in each sort of action—to determine that is\\nthe difficulty.\\n\\nYes, he said; there lies the difficulty.\\n\\nThen let us now try and determine whether they are the same or\\ndifferent.\\n\\nHow can we? he asked.\\n\\nI replied as follows: The same thing clearly cannot act or be acted\\nupon in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same\\ntime, in contrary ways; and therefore whenever this contradiction\\noccurs in things apparently the same, we know that they are really not\\nthe same, but different.\\n\\nGood.\\n\\nFor example, I said, can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the\\nsame time in the same part?\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nStill, I said, let us have a more precise statement of terms, lest we\\nshould hereafter fall out by the way. Imagine the case of a man who is\\nstanding and also moving his hands and his head, and suppose a person\\nto say that one and the same person is in motion and at rest at the\\nsame moment—to such a mode of speech we should object, and should\\nrather say that one part of him is in motion while another is at rest.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd suppose the objector to refine still further, and to draw the nice\\ndistinction that not only parts of tops, but whole tops, when they spin\\nround with their pegs fixed on the spot, are at rest and in motion at\\nthe same time (and he may say the same of anything which revolves in\\nthe same spot), his objection would not be admitted by us, because in\\nsuch cases things are not at rest and in motion in the same parts of\\nthemselves; we should rather say that they have both an axis and a\\ncircumference, and that the axis stands still, for there is no\\ndeviation from the perpendicular; and that the circumference goes\\nround. But if, while revolving, the axis inclines either to the right\\nor left, forwards or backwards, then in no point of view can they be at\\nrest.\\n\\nThat is the correct mode of describing them, he replied.\\n\\nThen none of these objections will confuse us, or incline us to believe\\nthat the same thing at the same time, in the same part or in relation\\nto the same thing, can act or be acted upon in contrary ways.\\n\\nCertainly not, according to my way of thinking.\\n\\nYet, I said, that we may not be compelled to examine all such\\nobjections, and prove at length that they are untrue, let us assume\\ntheir absurdity, and go forward on the understanding that hereafter, if\\nthis assumption turn out to be untrue, all the consequences which\\nfollow shall be withdrawn.\\n\\nYes, he said, that will be the best way.\\n\\nWell, I said, would you not allow that assent and dissent, desire and\\naversion, attraction and repulsion, are all of them opposites, whether\\nthey are regarded as active or passive (for that makes no difference in\\nthe fact of their opposition)?\\n\\nYes, he said, they are opposites.\\n\\nWell, I said, and hunger and thirst, and the desires in general, and\\nagain willing and wishing,—all these you would refer to the classes\\nalready mentioned. You would say—would you not?—that the soul of him\\nwho desires is seeking after the object of his desire; or that he is\\ndrawing to himself the thing which he wishes to possess: or again, when\\na person wants anything to be given him, his mind, longing for the\\nrealization of his desire, intimates his wish to have it by a nod of\\nassent, as if he had been asked a question?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence of\\ndesire; should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion\\nand rejection?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAdmitting this to be true of desire generally, let us suppose a\\nparticular class of desires, and out of these we will select hunger and\\nthirst, as they are termed, which are the most obvious of them?\\n\\nLet us take that class, he said.\\n\\nThe object of one is food, and of the other drink?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd here comes the point: is not thirst the desire which the soul has\\nof drink, and of drink only; not of drink qualified by anything else;\\nfor example, warm or cold, or much or little, or, in a word, drink of\\nany particular sort: but if the thirst be accompanied by heat, then the\\ndesire is of cold drink; or, if accompanied by cold, then of warm\\ndrink; or, if the thirst be excessive, then the drink which is desired\\nwill be excessive; or, if not great, the quantity of drink will also be\\nsmall: but thirst pure and simple will desire drink pure and simple,\\nwhich is the natural satisfaction of thirst, as food is of hunger?\\n\\nYes, he said; the simple desire is, as you say, in every case of the\\nsimple object, and the qualified desire of the qualified object.\\n\\nBut here a confusion may arise; and I should wish to guard against an\\nopponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only, but\\ngood drink, or food only, but good food; for good is the universal\\nobject of desire, and thirst being a desire, will necessarily be thirst\\nafter good drink; and the same is true of every other desire.\\n\\nYes, he replied, the opponent might have something to say.\\n\\nNevertheless I should still maintain, that of relatives some have a\\nquality attached to either term of the relation; others are simple and\\nhave their correlatives simple.\\n\\nI do not know what you mean.\\n\\nWell, you know of course that the greater is relative to the less?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd the much greater to the much less?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd the sometime greater to the sometime less, and the greater that is\\nto be to the less that is to be?\\n\\nCertainly, he said.\\n\\nAnd so of more and less, and of other correlative terms, such as the\\ndouble and the half, or again, the heavier and the lighter, the swifter\\nand the slower; and of hot and cold, and of any other relatives;—is not\\nthis true of all of them?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd does not the same principle hold in the sciences? The object of\\nscience is knowledge (assuming that to be the true definition), but the\\nobject of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge; I\\nmean, for example, that the science of house-building is a kind of\\nknowledge which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and is\\ntherefore termed architecture.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nBecause it has a particular quality which no other has?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd it has this particular quality because it has an object of a\\nparticular kind; and this is true of the other arts and sciences?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nNow, then, if I have made myself clear, you will understand my original\\nmeaning in what I said about relatives. My meaning was, that if one\\nterm of a relation is taken alone, the other is taken alone; if one\\nterm is qualified, the other is also qualified. I do not mean to say\\nthat relatives may not be disparate, or that the science of health is\\nhealthy, or of disease necessarily diseased, or that the sciences of\\ngood and evil are therefore good and evil; but only that, when the term\\nscience is no longer used absolutely, but has a qualified object which\\nin this case is the nature of health and disease, it becomes defined,\\nand is hence called not merely science, but the science of medicine.\\n\\nI quite understand, and I think as you do.\\n\\nWould you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative\\nterms, having clearly a relation—\\n\\nYes, thirst is relative to drink.\\n\\nAnd a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink;\\nbut thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little, nor of good nor\\nbad, nor of any particular kind of drink, but of drink only?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThen the soul of the thirsty one, in so far as he is thirsty, desires\\nonly drink; for this he yearns and tries to obtain it?\\n\\nThat is plain.\\n\\nAnd if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from\\ndrink, that must be different from the thirsty principle which draws\\nhim like a beast to drink; for, as we were saying, the same thing\\ncannot at the same time with the same part of itself act in contrary\\nways about the same.\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nNo more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and pull the\\nbow at the same time, but what you say is that one hand pushes and the\\nother pulls.\\n\\nExactly so, he replied.\\n\\nAnd might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink?\\n\\nYes, he said, it constantly happens.\\n\\nAnd in such a case what is one to say? Would you not say that there was\\nsomething in the soul bidding a man to drink, and something else\\nforbidding him, which is other and stronger than the principle which\\nbids him?\\n\\nI should say so.\\n\\nAnd the forbidding principle is derived from reason, and that which\\nbids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease?\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nThen we may fairly assume that they are two, and that they differ from\\none another; the one with which a man reasons, we may call the rational\\nprinciple of the soul, the other, with which he loves and hungers and\\nthirsts and feels the flutterings of any other desire, may be termed\\nthe irrational or appetitive, the ally of sundry pleasures and\\nsatisfactions?\\n\\nYes, he said, we may fairly assume them to be different.\\n\\nThen let us finally determine that there are two principles existing in\\nthe soul. And what of passion, or spirit? Is it a third, or akin to one\\nof the preceding?\\n\\nI should be inclined to say—akin to desire.\\n\\nWell, I said, there is a story which I remember to have heard, and in\\nwhich I put faith. The story is, that Leontius, the son of Aglaion,\\ncoming up one day from the Piraeus, under the north wall on the\\noutside, observed some dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of\\nexecution. He felt a desire to see them, and also a dread and\\nabhorrence of them; for a time he struggled and covered his eyes, but\\nat length the desire got the better of him; and forcing them open, he\\nran up to the dead bodies, saying, Look, ye wretches, take your fill of\\nthe fair sight.\\n\\nI have heard the story myself, he said.\\n\\nThe moral of the tale is, that anger at times goes to war with desire,\\nas though they were two distinct things.\\n\\nYes; that is the meaning, he said.\\n\\nAnd are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a\\nman’s desires violently prevail over his reason, he reviles himself,\\nand is angry at the violence within him, and that in this struggle,\\nwhich is like the struggle of factions in a State, his spirit is on the\\nside of his reason;—but for the passionate or spirited element to take\\npart with the desires when reason decides that she should not be\\nopposed, is a sort of thing which I believe that you never observed\\noccurring in yourself, nor, as I should imagine, in any one else?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nSuppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another, the nobler he\\nis the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering, such as\\nhunger, or cold, or any other pain which the injured person may inflict\\nupon him—these he deems to be just, and, as I say, his anger refuses to\\nbe excited by them.\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nBut when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong, then he boils\\nand chafes, and is on the side of what he believes to be justice; and\\nbecause he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more\\ndetermined to persevere and conquer. His noble spirit will not be\\nquelled until he either slays or is slain; or until he hears the voice\\nof the shepherd, that is, reason, bidding his dog bark no more.\\n\\nThe illustration is perfect, he replied; and in our State, as we were\\nsaying, the auxiliaries were to be dogs, and to hear the voice of the\\nrulers, who are their shepherds.\\n\\nI perceive, I said, that you quite understand me; there is, however, a\\nfurther point which I wish you to consider.\\n\\nWhat point?\\n\\nYou remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a\\nkind of desire, but now we should say quite the contrary; for in the\\nconflict of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational\\nprinciple.\\n\\nMost assuredly.\\n\\nBut a further question arises: Is passion different from reason also,\\nor only a kind of reason; in which latter case, instead of three\\nprinciples in the soul, there will only be two, the rational and the\\nconcupiscent; or rather, as the State was composed of three classes,\\ntraders, auxiliaries, counsellors, so may there not be in the\\nindividual soul a third element which is passion or spirit, and when\\nnot corrupted by bad education is the natural auxiliary of reason?\\n\\nYes, he said, there must be a third.\\n\\nYes, I replied, if passion, which has already been shown to be\\ndifferent from desire, turn out also to be different from reason.\\n\\nBut that is easily proved:—We may observe even in young children that\\nthey are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born, whereas some\\nof them never seem to attain to the use of reason, and most of them\\nlate enough.\\n\\nExcellent, I said, and you may see passion equally in brute animals,\\nwhich is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying. And we\\nmay once more appeal to the words of Homer, which have been already\\nquoted by us,\\n\\n‘He smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul,’\\n\\nfor in this verse Homer has clearly supposed the power which reasons\\nabout the better and worse to be different from the unreasoning anger\\nwhich is rebuked by it.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nAnd so, after much tossing, we have reached land, and are fairly agreed\\nthat the same principles which exist in the State exist also in the\\nindividual, and that they are three in number.\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nMust we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way, and\\nin virtue of the same quality which makes the State wise?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAlso that the same quality which constitutes courage in the State\\nconstitutes courage in the individual, and that both the State and the\\nindividual bear the same relation to all the other virtues?\\n\\nAssuredly.\\n\\nAnd the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same\\nway in which the State is just?\\n\\nThat follows, of course.\\n\\nWe cannot but remember that the justice of the State consisted in each\\nof the three classes doing the work of its own class?\\n\\nWe are not very likely to have forgotten, he said.\\n\\nWe must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of\\nhis nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own work?\\n\\nYes, he said, we must remember that too.\\n\\nAnd ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care\\nof the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to\\nbe the subject and ally?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd, as we were saying, the united influence of music and gymnastic\\nwill bring them into accord, nerving and sustaining the reason with\\nnoble words and lessons, and moderating and soothing and civilizing the\\nwildness of passion by harmony and rhythm?\\n\\nQuite true, he said.\\n\\nAnd these two, thus nurtured and educated, and having learned truly to\\nknow their own functions, will rule over the concupiscent, which in\\neach of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most\\ninsatiable of gain; over this they will keep guard, lest, waxing great\\nand strong with the fulness of bodily pleasures, as they are termed,\\nthe concupiscent soul, no longer confined to her own sphere, should\\nattempt to enslave and rule those who are not her natural-born\\nsubjects, and overturn the whole life of man?\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nBoth together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul and\\nthe whole body against attacks from without; the one counselling, and\\nthe other fighting under his leader, and courageously executing his\\ncommands and counsels?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and\\nin pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to\\nfear?\\n\\nRight, he replied.\\n\\nAnd him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules, and\\nwhich proclaims these commands; that part too being supposed to have a\\nknowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of\\nthe whole?\\n\\nAssuredly.\\n\\nAnd would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements\\nin friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and\\nthe two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that\\nreason ought to rule, and do not rebel?\\n\\nCertainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether in\\nthe State or individual.\\n\\nAnd surely, I said, we have explained again and again how and by virtue\\nof what quality a man will be just.\\n\\nThat is very certain.\\n\\nAnd is justice dimmer in the individual, and is her form different, or\\nis she the same which we found her to be in the State?\\n\\nThere is no difference in my opinion, he said.\\n\\nBecause, if any doubt is still lingering in our minds, a few\\ncommonplace instances will satisfy us of the truth of what I am saying.\\n\\nWhat sort of instances do you mean?\\n\\nIf the case is put to us, must we not admit that the just State, or the\\nman who is trained in the principles of such a State, will be less\\nlikely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver?\\nWould any one deny this?\\n\\nNo one, he replied.\\n\\nWill the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft, or\\ntreachery either to his friends or to his country?\\n\\nNever.\\n\\nNeither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or\\nagreements?\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nNo one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his\\nfather and mother, or to fail in his religious duties?\\n\\nNo one.\\n\\nAnd the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business,\\nwhether in ruling or being ruled?\\n\\nExactly so.\\n\\nAre you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such\\nstates is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?\\n\\nNot I, indeed.\\n\\nThen our dream has been realized; and the suspicion which we\\nentertained at the beginning of our work of construction, that some\\ndivine power must have conducted us to a primary form of justice, has\\nnow been verified?\\n\\nYes, certainly.\\n\\nAnd the division of labour which required the carpenter and the\\nshoemaker and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own\\nbusiness, and not another’s, was a shadow of justice, and for that\\nreason it was of use?\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nBut in reality justice was such as we were describing, being concerned\\nhowever, not with the outward man, but with the inward, which is the\\ntrue self and concernment of man: for the just man does not permit the\\nseveral elements within him to interfere with one another, or any of\\nthem to do the work of others,—he sets in order his own inner life, and\\nis his own master and his own law, and at peace with himself; and when\\nhe has bound together the three principles within him, which may be\\ncompared to the higher, lower, and middle notes of the scale, and the\\nintermediate intervals—when he has bound all these together, and is no\\nlonger many, but has become one entirely temperate and perfectly\\nadjusted nature, then he proceeds to act, if he has to act, whether in\\na matter of property, or in the treatment of the body, or in some\\naffair of politics or private business; always thinking and calling\\nthat which preserves and co-operates with this harmonious condition,\\njust and good action, and the knowledge which presides over it, wisdom,\\nand that which at any time impairs this condition, he will call unjust\\naction, and the opinion which presides over it ignorance.\\n\\nYou have said the exact truth, Socrates.\\n\\nVery good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man\\nand the just State, and the nature of justice in each of them, we\\nshould not be telling a falsehood?\\n\\nMost certainly not.\\n\\nMay we say so, then?\\n\\nLet us say so.\\n\\nAnd now, I said, injustice has to be considered.\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nMust not injustice be a strife which arises among the three\\nprinciples—a meddlesomeness, and interference, and rising up of a part\\nof the soul against the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority,\\nwhich is made by a rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he\\nis the natural vassal,—what is all this confusion and delusion but\\ninjustice, and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance, and every form\\nof vice?\\n\\nExactly so.\\n\\nAnd if the nature of justice and injustice be known, then the meaning\\nof acting unjustly and being unjust, or, again, of acting justly, will\\nalso be perfectly clear?\\n\\nWhat do you mean? he said.\\n\\nWhy, I said, they are like disease and health; being in the soul just\\nwhat disease and health are in the body.\\n\\nHow so? he said.\\n\\nWhy, I said, that which is healthy causes health, and that which is\\nunhealthy causes disease.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause injustice?\\n\\nThat is certain.\\n\\nAnd the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and\\ngovernment of one by another in the parts of the body; and the creation\\nof disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this\\nnatural order?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order\\nand government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the\\ncreation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance\\nwith the natural order?\\n\\nExactly so, he said.\\n\\nThen virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the soul, and\\nvice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to vice?\\n\\nAssuredly.\\n\\nStill our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and\\ninjustice has not been answered: Which is the more profitable, to be\\njust and act justly and practise virtue, whether seen or unseen of gods\\nand men, or to be unjust and act unjustly, if only unpunished and\\nunreformed?\\n\\nIn my judgment, Socrates, the question has now become ridiculous. We\\nknow that, when the bodily constitution is gone, life is no longer\\nendurable, though pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks, and\\nhaving all wealth and all power; and shall we be told that when the\\nvery essence of the vital principle is undermined and corrupted, life\\nis still worth having to a man, if only he be allowed to do whatever he\\nlikes with the single exception that he is not to acquire justice and\\nvirtue, or to escape from injustice and vice; assuming them both to be\\nsuch as we have described?\\n\\nYes, I said, the question is, as you say, ridiculous. Still, as we are\\nnear the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner with\\nour own eyes, let us not faint by the way.\\n\\nCertainly not, he replied.\\n\\nCome up hither, I said, and behold the various forms of vice, those of\\nthem, I mean, which are worth looking at.\\n\\nI am following you, he replied: proceed.\\n\\nI said, The argument seems to have reached a height from which, as from\\nsome tower of speculation, a man may look down and see that virtue is\\none, but that the forms of vice are innumerable; there being four\\nspecial ones which are deserving of note.\\n\\nWhat do you mean? he said.\\n\\nI mean, I replied, that there appear to be as many forms of the soul as\\nthere are distinct forms of the State.\\n\\nHow many?\\n\\nThere are five of the State, and five of the soul, I said.\\n\\nWhat are they?\\n\\nThe first, I said, is that which we have been describing, and which may\\nbe said to have two names, monarchy and aristocracy, accordingly as\\nrule is exercised by one distinguished man or by many.\\n\\nTrue, he replied.\\n\\nBut I regard the two names as describing one form only; for whether the\\ngovernment is in the hands of one or many, if the governors have been\\ntrained in the manner which we have supposed, the fundamental laws of\\nthe State will be maintained.\\n\\nThat is true, he replied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n BOOK V.\\n\\n\\nSuch is the good and true City or State, and the good and true man is\\nof the same pattern; and if this is right every other is wrong; and the\\nevil is one which affects not only the ordering of the State, but also\\nthe regulation of the individual soul, and is exhibited in four forms.\\n\\nWhat are they? he said.\\n\\nI was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil forms\\nappeared to me to succeed one another, when Polemarchus, who was\\nsitting a little way off, just beyond Adeimantus, began to whisper to\\nhim: stretching forth his hand, he took hold of the upper part of his\\ncoat by the shoulder, and drew him towards him, leaning forward himself\\nso as to be quite close and saying something in his ear, of which I\\nonly caught the words, ‘Shall we let him off, or what shall we do?’\\n\\nCertainly not, said Adeimantus, raising his voice.\\n\\nWho is it, I said, whom you are refusing to let off?\\n\\nYou, he said.\\n\\nI repeated, Why am I especially not to be let off?\\n\\nWhy, he said, we think that you are lazy, and mean to cheat us out of a\\nwhole chapter which is a very important part of the story; and you\\nfancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding; as if it\\nwere self-evident to everybody, that in the matter of women and\\nchildren ‘friends have all things in common.’\\n\\nAnd was I not right, Adeimantus?\\n\\nYes, he said; but what is right in this particular case, like\\neverything else, requires to be explained; for community may be of many\\nkinds. Please, therefore, to say what sort of community you mean. We\\nhave been long expecting that you would tell us something about the\\nfamily life of your citizens—how they will bring children into the\\nworld, and rear them when they have arrived, and, in general, what is\\nthe nature of this community of women and children—for we are of\\nopinion that the right or wrong management of such matters will have a\\ngreat and paramount influence on the State for good or for evil. And\\nnow, since the question is still undetermined, and you are taking in\\nhand another State, we have resolved, as you heard, not to let you go\\nuntil you give an account of all this.\\n\\nTo that resolution, said Glaucon, you may regard me as saying Agreed.\\n\\nAnd without more ado, said Thrasymachus, you may consider us all to be\\nequally agreed.\\n\\nI said, You know not what you are doing in thus assailing me: What an\\nargument are you raising about the State! Just as I thought that I had\\nfinished, and was only too glad that I had laid this question to sleep,\\nand was reflecting how fortunate I was in your acceptance of what I\\nthen said, you ask me to begin again at the very foundation, ignorant\\nof what a hornet’s nest of words you are stirring. Now I foresaw this\\ngathering trouble, and avoided it.\\n\\nFor what purpose do you conceive that we have come here, said\\nThrasymachus,—to look for gold, or to hear discourse?\\n\\nYes, but discourse should have a limit.\\n\\nYes, Socrates, said Glaucon, and the whole of life is the only limit\\nwhich wise men assign to the hearing of such discourses. But never mind\\nabout us; take heart yourself and answer the question in your own way:\\nWhat sort of community of women and children is this which is to\\nprevail among our guardians? and how shall we manage the period between\\nbirth and education, which seems to require the greatest care? Tell us\\nhow these things will be.\\n\\nYes, my simple friend, but the answer is the reverse of easy; many more\\ndoubts arise about this than about our previous conclusions. For the\\npracticability of what is said may be doubted; and looked at in another\\npoint of view, whether the scheme, if ever so practicable, would be for\\nthe best, is also doubtful. Hence I feel a reluctance to approach the\\nsubject, lest our aspiration, my dear friend, should turn out to be a\\ndream only.\\n\\nFear not, he replied, for your audience will not be hard upon you; they\\nare not sceptical or hostile.\\n\\nI said: My good friend, I suppose that you mean to encourage me by\\nthese words.\\n\\nYes, he said.\\n\\nThen let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse; the\\nencouragement which you offer would have been all very well had I\\nmyself believed that I knew what I was talking about: to declare the\\ntruth about matters of high interest which a man honours and loves\\namong wise men who love him need occasion no fear or faltering in his\\nmind; but to carry on an argument when you are yourself only a\\nhesitating enquirer, which is my condition, is a dangerous and slippery\\nthing; and the danger is not that I shall be laughed at (of which the\\nfear would be childish), but that I shall miss the truth where I have\\nmost need to be sure of my footing, and drag my friends after me in my\\nfall. And I pray Nemesis not to visit upon me the words which I am\\ngoing to utter. For I do indeed believe that to be an involuntary\\nhomicide is a less crime than to be a deceiver about beauty or goodness\\nor justice in the matter of laws. And that is a risk which I would\\nrather run among enemies than among friends, and therefore you do well\\nto encourage me.\\n\\nGlaucon laughed and said: Well then, Socrates, in case you and your\\nargument do us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand of\\nthe homicide, and shall not be held to be a deceiver; take courage then\\nand speak.\\n\\nWell, I said, the law says that when a man is acquitted he is free from\\nguilt, and what holds at law may hold in argument.\\n\\nThen why should you mind?\\n\\nWell, I replied, I suppose that I must retrace my steps and say what I\\nperhaps ought to have said before in the proper place. The part of the\\nmen has been played out, and now properly enough comes the turn of the\\nwomen. Of them I will proceed to speak, and the more readily since I am\\ninvited by you.\\n\\nFor men born and educated like our citizens, the only way, in my\\nopinion, of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and use\\nof women and children is to follow the path on which we originally\\nstarted, when we said that the men were to be the guardians and\\nwatchdogs of the herd.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nLet us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be\\nsubject to similar or nearly similar regulations; then we shall see\\nwhether the result accords with our design.\\n\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nWhat I mean may be put into the form of a question, I said: Are dogs\\ndivided into hes and shes, or do they both share equally in hunting and\\nin keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs? or do we entrust to\\nthe males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks, while we leave\\nthe females at home, under the idea that the bearing and suckling their\\npuppies is labour enough for them?\\n\\nNo, he said, they share alike; the only difference between them is that\\nthe males are stronger and the females weaker.\\n\\nBut can you use different animals for the same purpose, unless they are\\nbred and fed in the same way?\\n\\nYou cannot.\\n\\nThen, if women are to have the same duties as men, they must have the\\nsame nurture and education?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThe education which was assigned to the men was music and gymnastic.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThen women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of war,\\nwhich they must practise like the men?\\n\\nThat is the inference, I suppose.\\n\\nI should rather expect, I said, that several of our proposals, if they\\nare carried out, being unusual, may appear ridiculous.\\n\\nNo doubt of it.\\n\\nYes, and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women\\nnaked in the palaestra, exercising with the men, especially when they\\nare no longer young; they certainly will not be a vision of beauty, any\\nmore than the enthusiastic old men who in spite of wrinkles and\\nugliness continue to frequent the gymnasia.\\n\\nYes, indeed, he said: according to present notions the proposal would\\nbe thought ridiculous.\\n\\nBut then, I said, as we have determined to speak our minds, we must not\\nfear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this sort of\\ninnovation; how they will talk of women’s attainments both in music and\\ngymnastic, and above all about their wearing armour and riding upon\\nhorseback!\\n\\nVery true, he replied.\\n\\nYet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law; at\\nthe same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be\\nserious. Not long ago, as we shall remind them, the Hellenes were of\\nthe opinion, which is still generally received among the barbarians,\\nthat the sight of a naked man was ridiculous and improper; and when\\nfirst the Cretans and then the Lacedaemonians introduced the custom,\\nthe wits of that day might equally have ridiculed the innovation.\\n\\nNo doubt.\\n\\nBut when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was far\\nbetter than to cover them up, and the ludicrous effect to the outward\\neye vanished before the better principle which reason asserted, then\\nthe man was perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of his\\nridicule at any other sight but that of folly and vice, or seriously\\ninclines to weigh the beautiful by any other standard but that of the\\ngood.\\n\\nVery true, he replied.\\n\\nFirst, then, whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest,\\nlet us come to an understanding about the nature of woman: Is she\\ncapable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men, or\\nnot at all? And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or\\ncan not share? That will be the best way of commencing the enquiry, and\\nwill probably lead to the fairest conclusion.\\n\\nThat will be much the best way.\\n\\nShall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against\\nourselves; in this manner the adversary’s position will not be\\nundefended.\\n\\nWhy not? he said.\\n\\nThen let us put a speech into the mouths of our opponents. They will\\nsay: ‘Socrates and Glaucon, no adversary need convict you, for you\\nyourselves, at the first foundation of the State, admitted the\\nprinciple that everybody was to do the one work suited to his own\\nnature.’ And certainly, if I am not mistaken, such an admission was\\nmade by us. ‘And do not the natures of men and women differ very much\\nindeed?’ And we shall reply: Of course they do. Then we shall be asked,\\n‘Whether the tasks assigned to men and to women should not be\\ndifferent, and such as are agreeable to their different natures?’\\nCertainly they should. ‘But if so, have you not fallen into a serious\\ninconsistency in saying that men and women, whose natures are so\\nentirely different, ought to perform the same actions?’—What defence\\nwill you make for us, my good Sir, against any one who offers these\\nobjections?\\n\\nThat is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly; and I shall\\nand I do beg of you to draw out the case on our side.\\n\\nThese are the objections, Glaucon, and there are many others of a like\\nkind, which I foresaw long ago; they made me afraid and reluctant to\\ntake in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women and\\nchildren.\\n\\nBy Zeus, he said, the problem to be solved is anything but easy.\\n\\nWhy yes, I said, but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth,\\nwhether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into mid ocean, he\\nhas to swim all the same.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd must not we swim and try to reach the shore: we will hope that\\nArion’s dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us?\\n\\nI suppose so, he said.\\n\\nWell then, let us see if any way of escape can be found. We\\nacknowledged—did we not? that different natures ought to have different\\npursuits, and that men’s and women’s natures are different. And now\\nwhat are we saying?—that different natures ought to have the same\\npursuits,—this is the inconsistency which is charged upon us.\\n\\nPrecisely.\\n\\nVerily, Glaucon, I said, glorious is the power of the art of\\ncontradiction!\\n\\nWhy do you say so?\\n\\nBecause I think that many a man falls into the practice against his\\nwill. When he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing, just\\nbecause he cannot define and divide, and so know that of which he is\\nspeaking; and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit\\nof contention and not of fair discussion.\\n\\nYes, he replied, such is very often the case; but what has that to do\\nwith us and our argument?\\n\\nA great deal; for there is certainly a danger of our getting\\nunintentionally into a verbal opposition.\\n\\nIn what way?\\n\\nWhy we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth, that\\ndifferent natures ought to have different pursuits, but we never\\nconsidered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of\\nnature, or why we distinguished them when we assigned different\\npursuits to different natures and the same to the same natures.\\n\\nWhy, no, he said, that was never considered by us.\\n\\nI said: Suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the question\\nwhether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and hairy\\nmen; and if this is admitted by us, then, if bald men are cobblers, we\\nshould forbid the hairy men to be cobblers, and conversely?\\n\\nThat would be a jest, he said.\\n\\nYes, I said, a jest; and why? because we never meant when we\\nconstructed the State, that the opposition of natures should extend to\\nevery difference, but only to those differences which affected the\\npursuit in which the individual is engaged; we should have argued, for\\nexample, that a physician and one who is in mind a physician may be\\nsaid to have the same nature.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nWhereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd if, I said, the male and female sex appear to differ in their\\nfitness for any art or pursuit, we should say that such pursuit or art\\nought to be assigned to one or the other of them; but if the difference\\nconsists only in women bearing and men begetting children, this does\\nnot amount to a proof that a woman differs from a man in respect of the\\nsort of education she should receive; and we shall therefore continue\\nto maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same\\npursuits.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nNext, we shall ask our opponent how, in reference to any of the\\npursuits or arts of civic life, the nature of a woman differs from that\\nof a man?\\n\\nThat will be quite fair.\\n\\nAnd perhaps he, like yourself, will reply that to give a sufficient\\nanswer on the instant is not easy; but after a little reflection there\\nis no difficulty.\\n\\nYes, perhaps.\\n\\nSuppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the argument, and\\nthen we may hope to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the\\nconstitution of women which would affect them in the administration of\\nthe State.\\n\\nBy all means.\\n\\nLet us say to him: Come now, and we will ask you a question:—when you\\nspoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect, did you mean to\\nsay that one man will acquire a thing easily, another with difficulty;\\na little learning will lead the one to discover a great deal; whereas\\nthe other, after much study and application, no sooner learns than he\\nforgets; or again, did you mean, that the one has a body which is a\\ngood servant to his mind, while the body of the other is a hindrance to\\nhim?—would not these be the sort of differences which distinguish the\\nman gifted by nature from the one who is ungifted?\\n\\nNo one will deny that.\\n\\nAnd can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has\\nnot all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female?\\nNeed I waste time in speaking of the art of weaving, and the management\\nof pancakes and preserves, in which womankind does really appear to be\\ngreat, and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things the\\nmost absurd?\\n\\nYou are quite right, he replied, in maintaining the general inferiority\\nof the female sex: although many women are in many things superior to\\nmany men, yet on the whole what you say is true.\\n\\nAnd if so, my friend, I said, there is no special faculty of\\nadministration in a state which a woman has because she is a woman, or\\nwhich a man has by virtue of his sex, but the gifts of nature are alike\\ndiffused in both; all the pursuits of men are the pursuits of women\\nalso, but in all of them a woman is inferior to a man.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nThen are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on\\nwomen?\\n\\nThat will never do.\\n\\nOne woman has a gift of healing, another not; one is a musician, and\\nanother has no music in her nature?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises, and\\nanother is unwarlike and hates gymnastics?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd one woman is a philosopher, and another is an enemy of philosophy;\\none has spirit, and another is without spirit?\\n\\nThat is also true.\\n\\nThen one woman will have the temper of a guardian, and another not. Was\\nnot the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of\\nthis sort?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nMen and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian; they\\ndiffer only in their comparative strength or weakness.\\n\\nObviously.\\n\\nAnd those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the\\ncompanions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom\\nthey resemble in capacity and in character?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?\\n\\nThey ought.\\n\\nThen, as we were saying before, there is nothing unnatural in assigning\\nmusic and gymnastic to the wives of the guardians—to that point we come\\nround again.\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nThe law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature, and therefore\\nnot an impossibility or mere aspiration; and the contrary practice,\\nwhich prevails at present, is in reality a violation of nature.\\n\\nThat appears to be true.\\n\\nWe had to consider, first, whether our proposals were possible, and\\nsecondly whether they were the most beneficial?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd the possibility has been acknowledged?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThe very great benefit has next to be established?\\n\\nQuite so.\\n\\nYou will admit that the same education which makes a man a good\\nguardian will make a woman a good guardian; for their original nature\\nis the same?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nI should like to ask you a question.\\n\\nWhat is it?\\n\\nWould you say that all men are equal in excellence, or is one man\\nbetter than another?\\n\\nThe latter.\\n\\nAnd in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the\\nguardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more\\nperfect men, or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling?\\n\\nWhat a ridiculous question!\\n\\nYou have answered me, I replied: Well, and may we not further say that\\nour guardians are the best of our citizens?\\n\\nBy far the best.\\n\\nAnd will not their wives be the best women?\\n\\nYes, by far the best.\\n\\nAnd can there be anything better for the interests of the State than\\nthat the men and women of a State should be as good as possible?\\n\\nThere can be nothing better.\\n\\nAnd this is what the arts of music and gymnastic, when present in such\\nmanner as we have described, will accomplish?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThen we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest\\ndegree beneficial to the State?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThen let the wives of our guardians strip, for their virtue will be\\ntheir robe, and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of\\ntheir country; only in the distribution of labours the lighter are to\\nbe assigned to the women, who are the weaker natures, but in other\\nrespects their duties are to be the same. And as for the man who laughs\\nat naked women exercising their bodies from the best of motives, in his\\nlaughter he is plucking\\n\\n‘A fruit of unripe wisdom,’\\n\\nand he himself is ignorant of what he is laughing at, or what he is\\nabout;—for that is, and ever will be, the best of sayings, That the\\nuseful is the noble and the hurtful is the base.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nHere, then, is one difficulty in our law about women, which we may say\\nthat we have now escaped; the wave has not swallowed us up alive for\\nenacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their\\npursuits in common; to the utility and also to the possibility of this\\narrangement the consistency of the argument with itself bears witness.\\n\\nYes, that was a mighty wave which you have escaped.\\n\\nYes, I said, but a greater is coming; you will not think much of this\\nwhen you see the next.\\n\\nGo on; let me see.\\n\\nThe law, I said, which is the sequel of this and of all that has\\npreceded, is to the following effect,—‘that the wives of our guardians\\nare to be common, and their children are to be common, and no parent is\\nto know his own child, nor any child his parent.’\\n\\nYes, he said, that is a much greater wave than the other; and the\\npossibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more\\nquestionable.\\n\\nI do not think, I said, that there can be any dispute about the very\\ngreat utility of having wives and children in common; the possibility\\nis quite another matter, and will be very much disputed.\\n\\nI think that a good many doubts may be raised about both.\\n\\nYou imply that the two questions must be combined, I replied. Now I\\nmeant that you should admit the utility; and in this way, as I thought,\\nI should escape from one of them, and then there would remain only the\\npossibility.\\n\\nBut that little attempt is detected, and therefore you will please to\\ngive a defence of both.\\n\\nWell, I said, I submit to my fate. Yet grant me a little favour: let me\\nfeast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of\\nfeasting themselves when they are walking alone; for before they have\\ndiscovered any means of effecting their wishes—that is a matter which\\nnever troubles them—they would rather not tire themselves by thinking\\nabout possibilities; but assuming that what they desire is already\\ngranted to them, they proceed with their plan, and delight in detailing\\nwhat they mean to do when their wish has come true—that is a way which\\nthey have of not doing much good to a capacity which was never good for\\nmuch. Now I myself am beginning to lose heart, and I should like, with\\nyour permission, to pass over the question of possibility at present.\\nAssuming therefore the possibility of the proposal, I shall now proceed\\nto enquire how the rulers will carry out these arrangements, and I\\nshall demonstrate that our plan, if executed, will be of the greatest\\nbenefit to the State and to the guardians. First of all, then, if you\\nhave no objection, I will endeavour with your help to consider the\\nadvantages of the measure; and hereafter the question of possibility.\\n\\nI have no objection; proceed.\\n\\nFirst, I think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be\\nworthy of the name which they bear, there must be willingness to obey\\nin the one and the power of command in the other; the guardians must\\nthemselves obey the laws, and they must also imitate the spirit of them\\nin any details which are entrusted to their care.\\n\\nThat is right, he said.\\n\\nYou, I said, who are their legislator, having selected the men, will\\nnow select the women and give them to them;—they must be as far as\\npossible of like natures with them; and they must live in common houses\\nand meet at common meals. None of them will have anything specially his\\nor her own; they will be together, and will be brought up together, and\\nwill associate at gymnastic exercises. And so they will be drawn by a\\nnecessity of their natures to have intercourse with each\\nother—necessity is not too strong a word, I think?\\n\\nYes, he said;—necessity, not geometrical, but another sort of necessity\\nwhich lovers know, and which is far more convincing and constraining to\\nthe mass of mankind.\\n\\nTrue, I said; and this, Glaucon, like all the rest, must proceed after\\nan orderly fashion; in a city of the blessed, licentiousness is an\\nunholy thing which the rulers will forbid.\\n\\nYes, he said, and it ought not to be permitted.\\n\\nThen clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the\\nhighest degree, and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred?\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nAnd how can marriages be made most beneficial?—that is a question which\\nI put to you, because I see in your house dogs for hunting, and of the\\nnobler sort of birds not a few. Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have\\nyou ever attended to their pairing and breeding?\\n\\nIn what particulars?\\n\\nWhy, in the first place, although they are all of a good sort, are not\\nsome better than others?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd do you breed from them all indifferently, or do you take care to\\nbreed from the best only?\\n\\nFrom the best.\\n\\nAnd do you take the oldest or the youngest, or only those of ripe age?\\n\\nI choose only those of ripe age.\\n\\nAnd if care was not taken in the breeding, your dogs and birds would\\ngreatly deteriorate?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd the same of horses and animals in general?\\n\\nUndoubtedly.\\n\\nGood heavens! my dear friend, I said, what consummate skill will our\\nrulers need if the same principle holds of the human species!\\n\\nCertainly, the same principle holds; but why does this involve any\\nparticular skill?\\n\\nBecause, I said, our rulers will often have to practise upon the body\\ncorporate with medicines. Now you know that when patients do not\\nrequire medicines, but have only to be put under a regimen, the\\ninferior sort of practitioner is deemed to be good enough; but when\\nmedicine has to be given, then the doctor should be more of a man.\\n\\nThat is quite true, he said; but to what are you alluding?\\n\\nI mean, I replied, that our rulers will find a considerable dose of\\nfalsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects: we were\\nsaying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines might be\\nof advantage.\\n\\nAnd we were very right.\\n\\nAnd this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the\\nregulations of marriages and births.\\n\\nHow so?\\n\\nWhy, I said, the principle has been already laid down that the best of\\neither sex should be united with the best as often, and the inferior\\nwith the inferior, as seldom as possible; and that they should rear the\\noffspring of the one sort of union, but not of the other, if the flock\\nis to be maintained in first-rate condition. Now these goings on must\\nbe a secret which the rulers only know, or there will be a further\\ndanger of our herd, as the guardians may be termed, breaking out into\\nrebellion.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nHad we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring\\ntogether the brides and bridegrooms, and sacrifices will be offered and\\nsuitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets: the number of weddings\\nis a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers, whose\\naim will be to preserve the average of population? There are many other\\nthings which they will have to consider, such as the effects of wars\\nand diseases and any similar agencies, in order as far as this is\\npossible to prevent the State from becoming either too large or too\\nsmall.\\n\\nCertainly, he replied.\\n\\nWe shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less\\nworthy may draw on each occasion of our bringing them together, and\\nthen they will accuse their own ill-luck and not the rulers.\\n\\nTo be sure, he said.\\n\\nAnd I think that our braver and better youth, besides their other\\nhonours and rewards, might have greater facilities of intercourse with\\nwomen given them; their bravery will be a reason, and such fathers\\nought to have as many sons as possible.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd the proper officers, whether male or female or both, for offices\\nare to be held by women as well as by men—\\n\\nYes—\\n\\nThe proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the\\npen or fold, and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who\\ndwell in a separate quarter; but the offspring of the inferior, or of\\nthe better when they chance to be deformed, will be put away in some\\nmysterious, unknown place, as they should be.\\n\\nYes, he said, that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to be\\nkept pure.\\n\\nThey will provide for their nurture, and will bring the mothers to the\\nfold when they are full of milk, taking the greatest possible care that\\nno mother recognises her own child; and other wet-nurses may be engaged\\nif more are required. Care will also be taken that the process of\\nsuckling shall not be protracted too long; and the mothers will have no\\ngetting up at night or other trouble, but will hand over all this sort\\nof thing to the nurses and attendants.\\n\\nYou suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of it\\nwhen they are having children.\\n\\nWhy, said I, and so they ought. Let us, however, proceed with our\\nscheme. We were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd what is the prime of life? May it not be defined as a period of\\nabout twenty years in a woman’s life, and thirty in a man’s?\\n\\nWhich years do you mean to include?\\n\\nA woman, I said, at twenty years of age may begin to bear children to\\nthe State, and continue to bear them until forty; a man may begin at\\nfive-and-twenty, when he has passed the point at which the pulse of\\nlife beats quickest, and continue to beget children until he be\\nfifty-five.\\n\\nCertainly, he said, both in men and women those years are the prime of\\nphysical as well as of intellectual vigour.\\n\\nAny one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the public\\nhymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing;\\nthe child of which he is the father, if it steals into life, will have\\nbeen conceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and prayers,\\nwhich at each hymeneal priestesses and priest and the whole city will\\noffer, that the new generation may be better and more useful than their\\ngood and useful parents, whereas his child will be the offspring of\\ndarkness and strange lust.\\n\\nVery true, he replied.\\n\\nAnd the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed\\nage who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without\\nthe sanction of the rulers; for we shall say that he is raising up a\\nbastard to the State, uncertified and unconsecrated.\\n\\nVery true, he replied.\\n\\nThis applies, however, only to those who are within the specified age:\\nafter that we allow them to range at will, except that a man may not\\nmarry his daughter or his daughter’s daughter, or his mother or his\\nmother’s mother; and women, on the other hand, are prohibited from\\nmarrying their sons or fathers, or son’s son or father’s father, and so\\non in either direction. And we grant all this, accompanying the\\npermission with strict orders to prevent any embryo which may come into\\nbeing from seeing the light; and if any force a way to the birth, the\\nparents must understand that the offspring of such an union cannot be\\nmaintained, and arrange accordingly.\\n\\nThat also, he said, is a reasonable proposition. But how will they know\\nwho are fathers and daughters, and so on?\\n\\nThey will never know. The way will be this:—dating from the day of the\\nhymeneal, the bridegroom who was then married will call all the male\\nchildren who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards his\\nsons, and the female children his daughters, and they will call him\\nfather, and he will call their children his grandchildren, and they\\nwill call the elder generation grandfathers and grandmothers. All who\\nwere begotten at the time when their fathers and mothers came together\\nwill be called their brothers and sisters, and these, as I was saying,\\nwill be forbidden to inter-marry. This, however, is not to be\\nunderstood as an absolute prohibition of the marriage of brothers and\\nsisters; if the lot favours them, and they receive the sanction of the\\nPythian oracle, the law will allow them.\\n\\nQuite right, he replied.\\n\\nSuch is the scheme, Glaucon, according to which the guardians of our\\nState are to have their wives and families in common. And now you would\\nhave the argument show that this community is consistent with the rest\\nof our polity, and also that nothing can be better—would you not?\\n\\nYes, certainly.\\n\\nShall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought\\nto be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the\\norganization of a State,—what is the greatest good, and what is the\\ngreatest evil, and then consider whether our previous description has\\nthe stamp of the good or of the evil?\\n\\nBy all means.\\n\\nCan there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and\\nplurality where unity ought to reign? or any greater good than the bond\\nof unity?\\n\\nThere cannot.\\n\\nAnd there is unity where there is community of pleasures and\\npains—where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions\\nof joy and sorrow?\\n\\nNo doubt.\\n\\nYes; and where there is no common but only private feeling a State is\\ndisorganized—when you have one half of the world triumphing and the\\nother plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the\\ncitizens?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nSuch differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use of\\nthe terms ‘mine’ and ‘not mine,’ ‘his’ and ‘not his.’\\n\\nExactly so.\\n\\nAnd is not that the best-ordered State in which the greatest number of\\npersons apply the terms ‘mine’ and ‘not mine’ in the same way to the\\nsame thing?\\n\\nQuite true.\\n\\nOr that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the\\nindividual—as in the body, when but a finger of one of us is hurt, the\\nwhole frame, drawn towards the soul as a centre and forming one kingdom\\nunder the ruling power therein, feels the hurt and sympathizes all\\ntogether with the part affected, and we say that the man has a pain in\\nhis finger; and the same expression is used about any other part of the\\nbody, which has a sensation of pain at suffering or of pleasure at the\\nalleviation of suffering.\\n\\nVery true, he replied; and I agree with you that in the best-ordered\\nState there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you\\ndescribe.\\n\\nThen when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil, the\\nwhole State will make his case their own, and will either rejoice or\\nsorrow with him?\\n\\nYes, he said, that is what will happen in a well-ordered State.\\n\\nIt will now be time, I said, for us to return to our State and see\\nwhether this or some other form is most in accordance with these\\nfundamental principles.\\n\\nVery good.\\n\\nOur State like every other has rulers and subjects?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAll of whom will call one another citizens?\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nBut is there not another name which people give to their rulers in\\nother States?\\n\\nGenerally they call them masters, but in democratic States they simply\\ncall them rulers.\\n\\nAnd in our State what other name besides that of citizens do the people\\ngive the rulers?\\n\\nThey are called saviours and helpers, he replied.\\n\\nAnd what do the rulers call the people?\\n\\nTheir maintainers and foster-fathers.\\n\\nAnd what do they call them in other States?\\n\\nSlaves.\\n\\nAnd what do the rulers call one another in other States?\\n\\nFellow-rulers.\\n\\nAnd what in ours?\\n\\nFellow-guardians.\\n\\nDid you ever know an example in any other State of a ruler who would\\nspeak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not\\nbeing his friend?\\n\\nYes, very often.\\n\\nAnd the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an\\ninterest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nBut would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as\\na stranger?\\n\\nCertainly he would not; for every one whom they meet will be regarded\\nby them either as a brother or sister, or father or mother, or son or\\ndaughter, or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected\\nwith him.\\n\\nCapital, I said; but let me ask you once more: Shall they be a family\\nin name only; or shall they in all their actions be true to the name?\\nFor example, in the use of the word ‘father,’ would the care of a\\nfather be implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to\\nhim which the law commands; and is the violator of these duties to be\\nregarded as an impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to\\nreceive much good either at the hands of God or of man? Are these to be\\nor not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated in their\\nears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to them to be\\ntheir parents and the rest of their kinsfolk?\\n\\nThese, he said, and none other; for what can be more ridiculous than\\nfor them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not\\nto act in the spirit of them?\\n\\nThen in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often\\nheard than in any other. As I was describing before, when any one is\\nwell or ill, the universal word will be ‘with me it is well’ or ‘it is\\nill.’\\n\\nMost true.\\n\\nAnd agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking, were we not saying\\nthat they will have their pleasures and pains in common?\\n\\nYes, and so they will.\\n\\nAnd they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will\\nalike call ‘my own,’ and having this common interest they will have a\\ncommon feeling of pleasure and pain?\\n\\nYes, far more so than in other States.\\n\\nAnd the reason of this, over and above the general constitution of the\\nState, will be that the guardians will have a community of women and\\nchildren?\\n\\nThat will be the chief reason.\\n\\nAnd this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good, as was\\nimplied in our own comparison of a well-ordered State to the relation\\nof the body and the members, when affected by pleasure or pain?\\n\\nThat we acknowledged, and very rightly.\\n\\nThen the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly\\nthe source of the greatest good to the State?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd this agrees with the other principle which we were affirming,—that\\nthe guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other property;\\ntheir pay was to be their food, which they were to receive from the\\nother citizens, and they were to have no private expenses; for we\\nintended them to preserve their true character of guardians.\\n\\nRight, he replied.\\n\\nBoth the community of property and the community of families, as I am\\nsaying, tend to make them more truly guardians; they will not tear the\\ncity in pieces by differing about ‘mine’ and ‘not mine;’ each man\\ndragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his\\nown, where he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures\\nand pains; but all will be affected as far as may be by the same\\npleasures and pains because they are all of one opinion about what is\\nnear and dear to them, and therefore they all tend towards a common\\nend.\\n\\nCertainly, he replied.\\n\\nAnd as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their\\nown, suits and complaints will have no existence among them; they will\\nbe delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or\\nrelations are the occasion.\\n\\nOf course they will.\\n\\nNeither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur among\\nthem. For that equals should defend themselves against equals we shall\\nmaintain to be honourable and right; we shall make the protection of\\nthe person a matter of necessity.\\n\\nThat is good, he said.\\n\\nYes; and there is a further good in the law; viz. that if a man has a\\nquarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there, and\\nnot proceed to more dangerous lengths.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nTo the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the\\nyounger.\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nNor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any\\nother violence to an elder, unless the magistrates command him; nor\\nwill he slight him in any way. For there are two guardians, shame and\\nfear, mighty to prevent him: shame, which makes men refrain from laying\\nhands on those who are to them in the relation of parents; fear, that\\nthe injured one will be succoured by the others who are his brothers,\\nsons, fathers.\\n\\nThat is true, he replied.\\n\\nThen in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace\\nwith one another?\\n\\nYes, there will be no want of peace.\\n\\nAnd as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will be\\nno danger of the rest of the city being divided either against them or\\nagainst one another.\\n\\nNone whatever.\\n\\nI hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they will\\nbe rid, for they are beneath notice: such, for example, as the flattery\\nof the rich by the poor, and all the pains and pangs which men\\nexperience in bringing up a family, and in finding money to buy\\nnecessaries for their household, borrowing and then repudiating,\\ngetting how they can, and giving the money into the hands of women and\\nslaves to keep—the many evils of so many kinds which people suffer in\\nthis way are mean enough and obvious enough, and not worth speaking of.\\n\\nYes, he said, a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive that.\\n\\nAnd from all these evils they will be delivered, and their life will be\\nblessed as the life of Olympic victors and yet more blessed.\\n\\nHow so?\\n\\nThe Olympic victor, I said, is deemed happy in receiving a part only of\\nthe blessedness which is secured to our citizens, who have won a more\\nglorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the public\\ncost. For the victory which they have won is the salvation of the whole\\nState; and the crown with which they and their children are crowned is\\nthe fulness of all that life needs; they receive rewards from the hands\\nof their country while living, and after death have an honourable\\nburial.\\n\\nYes, he said, and glorious rewards they are.\\n\\nDo you remember, I said, how in the course of the previous discussion\\nsome one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians\\nunhappy—they had nothing and might have possessed all things—to whom we\\nreplied that, if an occasion offered, we might perhaps hereafter\\nconsider this question, but that, as at present advised, we would make\\nour guardians truly guardians, and that we were fashioning the State\\nwith a view to the greatest happiness, not of any particular class, but\\nof the whole?\\n\\nYes, I remember.\\n\\nAnd what do you say, now that the life of our protectors is made out to\\nbe far better and nobler than that of Olympic victors—is the life of\\nshoemakers, or any other artisans, or of husbandmen, to be compared\\nwith it?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nAt the same time I ought here to repeat what I have said elsewhere,\\nthat if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner\\nthat he will cease to be a guardian, and is not content with this safe\\nand harmonious life, which, in our judgment, is of all lives the best,\\nbut infatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into\\nhis head shall seek to appropriate the whole state to himself, then he\\nwill have to learn how wisely Hesiod spoke, when he said, ‘half is more\\nthan the whole.’\\n\\nIf he were to consult me, I should say to him: Stay where you are, when\\nyou have the offer of such a life.\\n\\nYou agree then, I said, that men and women are to have a common way of\\nlife such as we have described—common education, common children; and\\nthey are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the\\ncity or going out to war; they are to keep watch together, and to hunt\\ntogether like dogs; and always and in all things, as far as they are\\nable, women are to share with the men? And in so doing they will do\\nwhat is best, and will not violate, but preserve the natural relation\\nof the sexes.\\n\\nI agree with you, he replied.\\n\\nThe enquiry, I said, has yet to be made, whether such a community be\\nfound possible—as among other animals, so also among men—and if\\npossible, in what way possible?\\n\\nYou have anticipated the question which I was about to suggest.\\n\\nThere is no difficulty, I said, in seeing how war will be carried on by\\nthem.\\n\\nHow?\\n\\nWhy, of course they will go on expeditions together; and will take with\\nthem any of their children who are strong enough, that, after the\\nmanner of the artisan’s child, they may look on at the work which they\\nwill have to do when they are grown up; and besides looking on they\\nwill have to help and be of use in war, and to wait upon their fathers\\nand mothers. Did you never observe in the arts how the potters’ boys\\nlook on and help, long before they touch the wheel?\\n\\nYes, I have.\\n\\nAnd shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in\\ngiving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than\\nour guardians will be?\\n\\nThe idea is ridiculous, he said.\\n\\nThere is also the effect on the parents, with whom, as with other\\nanimals, the presence of their young ones will be the greatest\\nincentive to valour.\\n\\nThat is quite true, Socrates; and yet if they are defeated, which may\\noften happen in war, how great the danger is! the children will be lost\\nas well as their parents, and the State will never recover.\\n\\nTrue, I said; but would you never allow them to run any risk?\\n\\nI am far from saying that.\\n\\nWell, but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some\\noccasion when, if they escape disaster, they will be the better for it?\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nWhether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of their\\nyouth is a very important matter, for the sake of which some risk may\\nfairly be incurred.\\n\\nYes, very important.\\n\\nThis then must be our first step,—to make our children spectators of\\nwar; but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against\\ndanger; then all will be well.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nTheir parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war, but\\nto know, as far as human foresight can, what expeditions are safe and\\nwhat dangerous?\\n\\nThat may be assumed.\\n\\nAnd they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about\\nthe dangerous ones?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who\\nwill be their leaders and teachers?\\n\\nVery properly.\\n\\nStill, the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen; there is a good\\ndeal of chance about them?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThen against such chances the children must be at once furnished with\\nwings, in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape.\\n\\nWhat do you mean? he said.\\n\\nI mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth, and\\nwhen they have learnt to ride, take them on horseback to see war: the\\nhorses must not be spirited and warlike, but the most tractable and yet\\nthe swiftest that can be had. In this way they will get an excellent\\nview of what is hereafter to be their own business; and if there is\\ndanger they have only to follow their elder leaders and escape.\\n\\nI believe that you are right, he said.\\n\\nNext, as to war; what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one\\nanother and to their enemies? I should be inclined to propose that the\\nsoldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms, or is guilty of\\nany other act of cowardice, should be degraded into the rank of a\\nhusbandman or artisan. What do you think?\\n\\nBy all means, I should say.\\n\\nAnd he who allows himself to be taken prisoner may as well be made a\\npresent of to his enemies; he is their lawful prey, and let them do\\nwhat they like with him.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nBut the hero who has distinguished himself, what shall be done to him?\\nIn the first place, he shall receive honour in the army from his\\nyouthful comrades; every one of them in succession shall crown him.\\nWhat do you say?\\n\\nI approve.\\n\\nAnd what do you say to his receiving the right hand of fellowship?\\n\\nTo that too, I agree.\\n\\nBut you will hardly agree to my next proposal.\\n\\nWhat is your proposal?\\n\\nThat he should kiss and be kissed by them.\\n\\nMost certainly, and I should be disposed to go further, and say: Let no\\none whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while the\\nexpedition lasts. So that if there be a lover in the army, whether his\\nlove be youth or maiden, he may be more eager to win the prize of\\nvalour.\\n\\nCapital, I said. That the brave man is to have more wives than others\\nhas been already determined: and he is to have first choices in such\\nmatters more than others, in order that he may have as many children as\\npossible?\\n\\nAgreed.\\n\\nAgain, there is another manner in which, according to Homer, brave\\nyouths should be honoured; for he tells how Ajax, after he had\\ndistinguished himself in battle, was rewarded with long chines, which\\nseems to be a compliment appropriate to a hero in the flower of his\\nage, being not only a tribute of honour but also a very strengthening\\nthing.\\n\\nMost true, he said.\\n\\nThen in this, I said, Homer shall be our teacher; and we too, at\\nsacrifices and on the like occasions, will honour the brave according\\nto the measure of their valour, whether men or women, with hymns and\\nthose other distinctions which we were mentioning; also with\\n\\n‘seats of precedence, and meats and full cups;’\\n\\nand in honouring them, we shall be at the same time training them.\\n\\nThat, he replied, is excellent.\\n\\nYes, I said; and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say, in\\nthe first place, that he is of the golden race?\\n\\nTo be sure.\\n\\nNay, have we not the authority of Hesiod for affirming that when they\\nare dead\\n\\n‘They are holy angels upon the earth, authors of good, averters of\\nevil, the guardians of speech-gifted men’?\\n\\nYes; and we accept his authority.\\n\\nWe must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine\\nand heroic personages, and what is to be their special distinction; and\\nwe must do as he bids?\\n\\nBy all means.\\n\\nAnd in ages to come we will reverence them and kneel before their\\nsepulchres as at the graves of heroes. And not only they but any who\\nare deemed pre-eminently good, whether they die from age, or in any\\nother way, shall be admitted to the same honours.\\n\\nThat is very right, he said.\\n\\nNext, how shall our soldiers treat their enemies? What about this?\\n\\nIn what respect do you mean?\\n\\nFirst of all, in regard to slavery? Do you think it right that Hellenes\\nshould enslave Hellenic States, or allow others to enslave them, if\\nthey can help? Should not their custom be to spare them, considering\\nthe danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under\\nthe yoke of the barbarians?\\n\\nTo spare them is infinitely better.\\n\\nThen no Hellene should be owned by them as a slave; that is a rule\\nwhich they will observe and advise the other Hellenes to observe.\\n\\nCertainly, he said; they will in this way be united against the\\nbarbarians and will keep their hands off one another.\\n\\nNext as to the slain; ought the conquerors, I said, to take anything\\nbut their armour? Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford\\nan excuse for not facing the battle? Cowards skulk about the dead,\\npretending that they are fulfilling a duty, and many an army before now\\nhas been lost from this love of plunder.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse, and also\\na degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead\\nbody when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting gear\\nbehind him,—is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at his\\nassailant, quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead?\\n\\nVery like a dog, he said.\\n\\nThen we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial?\\n\\nYes, he replied, we most certainly must.\\n\\nNeither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods, least of all\\nthe arms of Hellenes, if we care to maintain good feeling with other\\nHellenes; and, indeed, we have reason to fear that the offering of\\nspoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the\\ngod himself?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAgain, as to the devastation of Hellenic territory or the burning of\\nhouses, what is to be the practice?\\n\\nMay I have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your opinion?\\n\\nBoth should be forbidden, in my judgment; I would take the annual\\nproduce and no more. Shall I tell you why?\\n\\nPray do.\\n\\nWhy, you see, there is a difference in the names ‘discord’ and ‘war,’\\nand I imagine that there is also a difference in their natures; the one\\nis expressive of what is internal and domestic, the other of what is\\nexternal and foreign; and the first of the two is termed discord, and\\nonly the second, war.\\n\\nThat is a very proper distinction, he replied.\\n\\nAnd may I not observe with equal propriety that the Hellenic race is\\nall united together by ties of blood and friendship, and alien and\\nstrange to the barbarians?\\n\\nVery good, he said.\\n\\nAnd therefore when Hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with\\nHellenes, they will be described by us as being at war when they fight,\\nand by nature enemies, and this kind of antagonism should be called\\nwar; but when Hellenes fight with one another we shall say that Hellas\\nis then in a state of disorder and discord, they being by nature\\nfriends; and such enmity is to be called discord.\\n\\nI agree.\\n\\nConsider then, I said, when that which we have acknowledged to be\\ndiscord occurs, and a city is divided, if both parties destroy the\\nlands and burn the houses of one another, how wicked does the strife\\nappear! No true lover of his country would bring himself to tear in\\npieces his own nurse and mother: There might be reason in the conqueror\\ndepriving the conquered of their harvest, but still they would have the\\nidea of peace in their hearts and would not mean to go on fighting for\\never.\\n\\nYes, he said, that is a better temper than the other.\\n\\nAnd will not the city, which you are founding, be an Hellenic city?\\n\\nIt ought to be, he replied.\\n\\nThen will not the citizens be good and civilized?\\n\\nYes, very civilized.\\n\\nAnd will they not be lovers of Hellas, and think of Hellas as their own\\nland, and share in the common temples?\\n\\nMost certainly.\\n\\nAnd any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them as\\ndiscord only—a quarrel among friends, which is not to be called a war?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nThen they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThey will use friendly correction, but will not enslave or destroy\\ntheir opponents; they will be correctors, not enemies?\\n\\nJust so.\\n\\nAnd as they are Hellenes themselves they will not devastate Hellas, nor\\nwill they burn houses, nor ever suppose that the whole population of a\\ncity—men, women, and children—are equally their enemies, for they know\\nthat the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and that the\\nmany are their friends. And for all these reasons they will be\\nunwilling to waste their lands and rase their houses; their enmity to\\nthem will only last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled\\nthe guilty few to give satisfaction?\\n\\nI agree, he said, that our citizens should thus deal with their\\nHellenic enemies; and with barbarians as the Hellenes now deal with one\\nanother.\\n\\nThen let us enact this law also for our guardians:—that they are\\nneither to devastate the lands of Hellenes nor to burn their houses.\\n\\nAgreed; and we may agree also in thinking that these, like all our\\nprevious enactments, are very good.\\n\\nBut still I must say, Socrates, that if you are allowed to go on in\\nthis way you will entirely forget the other question which at the\\ncommencement of this discussion you thrust aside:—Is such an order of\\nthings possible, and how, if at all? For I am quite ready to\\nacknowledge that the plan which you propose, if only feasible, would do\\nall sorts of good to the State. I will add, what you have omitted, that\\nyour citizens will be the bravest of warriors, and will never leave\\ntheir ranks, for they will all know one another, and each will call the\\nother father, brother, son; and if you suppose the women to join their\\narmies, whether in the same rank or in the rear, either as a terror to\\nthe enemy, or as auxiliaries in case of need, I know that they will\\nthen be absolutely invincible; and there are many domestic advantages\\nwhich might also be mentioned and which I also fully acknowledge: but,\\nas I admit all these advantages and as many more as you please, if only\\nthis State of yours were to come into existence, we need say no more\\nabout them; assuming then the existence of the State, let us now turn\\nto the question of possibility and ways and means—the rest may be left.\\n\\nIf I loiter for a moment, you instantly make a raid upon me, I said,\\nand have no mercy; I have hardly escaped the first and second waves,\\nand you seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the\\nthird, which is the greatest and heaviest. When you have seen and heard\\nthe third wave, I think you will be more considerate and will\\nacknowledge that some fear and hesitation was natural respecting a\\nproposal so extraordinary as that which I have now to state and\\ninvestigate.\\n\\nThe more appeals of this sort which you make, he said, the more\\ndetermined are we that you shall tell us how such a State is possible:\\nspeak out and at once.\\n\\nLet me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the\\nsearch after justice and injustice.\\n\\nTrue, he replied; but what of that?\\n\\nI was only going to ask whether, if we have discovered them, we are to\\nrequire that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice;\\nor may we be satisfied with an approximation, and the attainment in him\\nof a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men?\\n\\nThe approximation will be enough.\\n\\nWe were enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the\\ncharacter of the perfectly just, and into injustice and the perfectly\\nunjust, that we might have an ideal. We were to look at these in order\\nthat we might judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according to\\nthe standard which they exhibited and the degree in which we resembled\\nthem, but not with any view of showing that they could exist in fact.\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nWould a painter be any the worse because, after having delineated with\\nconsummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man, he was unable to\\nshow that any such man could ever have existed?\\n\\nHe would be none the worse.\\n\\nWell, and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect State?\\n\\nTo be sure.\\n\\nAnd is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the\\npossibility of a city being ordered in the manner described?\\n\\nSurely not, he replied.\\n\\nThat is the truth, I said. But if, at your request, I am to try and\\nshow how and under what conditions the possibility is highest, I must\\nask you, having this in view, to repeat your former admissions.\\n\\nWhat admissions?\\n\\nI want to know whether ideals are ever fully realized in language? Does\\nnot the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual,\\nwhatever a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short\\nof the truth? What do you say?\\n\\nI agree.\\n\\nThen you must not insist on my proving that the actual State will in\\nevery respect coincide with the ideal: if we are only able to discover\\nhow a city may be governed nearly as we proposed, you will admit that\\nwe have discovered the possibility which you demand; and will be\\ncontented. I am sure that I should be contented—will not you?\\n\\nYes, I will.\\n\\nLet me next endeavour to show what is that fault in States which is the\\ncause of their present maladministration, and what is the least change\\nwhich will enable a State to pass into the truer form; and let the\\nchange, if possible, be of one thing only, or, if not, of two; at any\\nrate, let the changes be as few and slight as possible.\\n\\nCertainly, he replied.\\n\\nI think, I said, that there might be a reform of the State if only one\\nchange were made, which is not a slight or easy though still a possible\\none.\\n\\nWhat is it? he said.\\n\\nNow then, I said, I go to meet that which I liken to the greatest of\\nthe waves; yet shall the word be spoken, even though the wave break and\\ndrown me in laughter and dishonour; and do you mark my words.\\n\\nProceed.\\n\\nI said: ‘Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this\\nworld have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness\\nand wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who pursue either to\\nthe exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities will\\nnever have rest from their evils,—nor the human race, as I believe,—and\\nthen only will this our State have a possibility of life and behold the\\nlight of day.’ Such was the thought, my dear Glaucon, which I would\\nfain have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant; for to be\\nconvinced that in no other State can there be happiness private or\\npublic is indeed a hard thing.\\n\\nSocrates, what do you mean? I would have you consider that the word\\nwhich you have uttered is one at which numerous persons, and very\\nrespectable persons too, in a figure pulling off their coats all in a\\nmoment, and seizing any weapon that comes to hand, will run at you\\nmight and main, before you know where you are, intending to do heaven\\nknows what; and if you don’t prepare an answer, and put yourself in\\nmotion, you will be ‘pared by their fine wits,’ and no mistake.\\n\\nYou got me into the scrape, I said.\\n\\nAnd I was quite right; however, I will do all I can to get you out of\\nit; but I can only give you good-will and good advice, and, perhaps, I\\nmay be able to fit answers to your questions better than another—that\\nis all. And now, having such an auxiliary, you must do your best to\\nshow the unbelievers that you are right.\\n\\nI ought to try, I said, since you offer me such invaluable assistance.\\nAnd I think that, if there is to be a chance of our escaping, we must\\nexplain to them whom we mean when we say that philosophers are to rule\\nin the State; then we shall be able to defend ourselves: There will be\\ndiscovered to be some natures who ought to study philosophy and to be\\nleaders in the State; and others who are not born to be philosophers,\\nand are meant to be followers rather than leaders.\\n\\nThen now for a definition, he said.\\n\\nFollow me, I said, and I hope that I may in some way or other be able\\nto give you a satisfactory explanation.\\n\\nProceed.\\n\\nI dare say that you remember, and therefore I need not remind you, that\\na lover, if he is worthy of the name, ought to show his love, not to\\nsome one part of that which he loves, but to the whole.\\n\\nI really do not understand, and therefore beg of you to assist my\\nmemory.\\n\\nAnother person, I said, might fairly reply as you do; but a man of\\npleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower of\\nyouth do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a lover’s breast,\\nand are thought by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards. Is not\\nthis a way which you have with the fair: one has a snub nose, and you\\npraise his charming face; the hook-nose of another has, you say, a\\nroyal look; while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the grace of\\nregularity: the dark visage is manly, the fair are children of the\\ngods; and as to the sweet ‘honey pale,’ as they are called, what is the\\nvery name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives, and is\\nnot averse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth? In a word,\\nthere is no excuse which you will not make, and nothing which you will\\nnot say, in order not to lose a single flower that blooms in the\\nspring-time of youth.\\n\\nIf you make me an authority in matters of love, for the sake of the\\nargument, I assent.\\n\\nAnd what do you say of lovers of wine? Do you not see them doing the\\nsame? They are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine.\\n\\nVery good.\\n\\nAnd the same is true of ambitious men; if they cannot command an army,\\nthey are willing to command a file; and if they cannot be honoured by\\nreally great and important persons, they are glad to be honoured by\\nlesser and meaner people,—but honour of some kind they must have.\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nOnce more let me ask: Does he who desires any class of goods, desire\\nthe whole class or a part only?\\n\\nThe whole.\\n\\nAnd may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover, not of a part\\nof wisdom only, but of the whole?\\n\\nYes, of the whole.\\n\\nAnd he who dislikes learning, especially in youth, when he has no power\\nof judging what is good and what is not, such an one we maintain not to\\nbe a philosopher or a lover of knowledge, just as he who refuses his\\nfood is not hungry, and may be said to have a bad appetite and not a\\ngood one?\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nWhereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is\\ncurious to learn and is never satisfied, may be justly termed a\\nphilosopher? Am I not right?\\n\\nGlaucon said: If curiosity makes a philosopher, you will find many a\\nstrange being will have a title to the name. All the lovers of sights\\nhave a delight in learning, and must therefore be included. Musical\\namateurs, too, are a folk strangely out of place among philosophers,\\nfor they are the last persons in the world who would come to anything\\nlike a philosophical discussion, if they could help, while they run\\nabout at the Dionysiac festivals as if they had let out their ears to\\nhear every chorus; whether the performance is in town or country—that\\nmakes no difference—they are there. Now are we to maintain that all\\nthese and any who have similar tastes, as well as the professors of\\nquite minor arts, are philosophers?\\n\\nCertainly not, I replied; they are only an imitation.\\n\\nHe said: Who then are the true philosophers?\\n\\nThose, I said, who are lovers of the vision of truth.\\n\\nThat is also good, he said; but I should like to know what you mean?\\n\\nTo another, I replied, I might have a difficulty in explaining; but I\\nam sure that you will admit a proposition which I am about to make.\\n\\nWhat is the proposition?\\n\\nThat since beauty is the opposite of ugliness, they are two?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd inasmuch as they are two, each of them is one?\\n\\nTrue again.\\n\\nAnd of just and unjust, good and evil, and of every other class, the\\nsame remark holds: taken singly, each of them is one; but from the\\nvarious combinations of them with actions and things and with one\\nanother, they are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd this is the distinction which I draw between the sight-loving,\\nart-loving, practical class and those of whom I am speaking, and who\\nare alone worthy of the name of philosophers.\\n\\nHow do you distinguish them? he said.\\n\\nThe lovers of sounds and sights, I replied, are, as I conceive, fond of\\nfine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products that\\nare made out of them, but their mind is incapable of seeing or loving\\nabsolute beauty.\\n\\nTrue, he replied.\\n\\nFew are they who are able to attain to the sight of this.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd he who, having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute\\nbeauty, or who, if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is\\nunable to follow—of such an one I ask, Is he awake or in a dream only?\\nReflect: is not the dreamer, sleeping or waking, one who likens\\ndissimilar things, who puts the copy in the place of the real object?\\n\\nI should certainly say that such an one was dreaming.\\n\\nBut take the case of the other, who recognises the existence of\\nabsolute beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects\\nwhich participate in the idea, neither putting the objects in the place\\nof the idea nor the idea in the place of the objects—is he a dreamer,\\nor is he awake?\\n\\nHe is wide awake.\\n\\nAnd may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge,\\nand that the mind of the other, who opines only, has opinion?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nBut suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our\\nstatement, can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him,\\nwithout revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits?\\n\\nWe must certainly offer him some good advice, he replied.\\n\\nCome, then, and let us think of something to say to him. Shall we begin\\nby assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have,\\nand that we are rejoiced at his having it? But we should like to ask\\nhim a question: Does he who has knowledge know something or nothing?\\n(You must answer for him.)\\n\\nI answer that he knows something.\\n\\nSomething that is or is not?\\n\\nSomething that is; for how can that which is not ever be known?\\n\\nAnd are we assured, after looking at the matter from many points of\\nview, that absolute being is or may be absolutely known, but that the\\nutterly non-existent is utterly unknown?\\n\\nNothing can be more certain.\\n\\nGood. But if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and\\nnot to be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being and\\nthe absolute negation of being?\\n\\nYes, between them.\\n\\nAnd, as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to\\nnot-being, for that intermediate between being and not-being there has\\nto be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and\\nknowledge, if there be such?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nDo we admit the existence of opinion?\\n\\nUndoubtedly.\\n\\nAs being the same with knowledge, or another faculty?\\n\\nAnother faculty.\\n\\nThen opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter\\ncorresponding to this difference of faculties?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd knowledge is relative to being and knows being. But before I\\nproceed further I will make a division.\\n\\nWhat division?\\n\\nI will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves: they are\\npowers in us, and in all other things, by which we do as we do. Sight\\nand hearing, for example, I should call faculties. Have I clearly\\nexplained the class which I mean?\\n\\nYes, I quite understand.\\n\\nThen let me tell you my view about them. I do not see them, and\\ntherefore the distinctions of figure, colour, and the like, which\\nenable me to discern the differences of some things, do not apply to\\nthem. In speaking of a faculty I think only of its sphere and its\\nresult; and that which has the same sphere and the same result I call\\nthe same faculty, but that which has another sphere and another result\\nI call different. Would that be your way of speaking?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd will you be so very good as to answer one more question? Would you\\nsay that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?\\n\\nCertainly knowledge is a faculty, and the mightiest of all faculties.\\n\\nAnd is opinion also a faculty?\\n\\nCertainly, he said; for opinion is that with which we are able to form\\nan opinion.\\n\\nAnd yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not\\nthe same as opinion?\\n\\nWhy, yes, he said: how can any reasonable being ever identify that\\nwhich is infallible with that which errs?\\n\\nAn excellent answer, proving, I said, that we are quite conscious of a\\ndistinction between them.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThen knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct\\nspheres or subject-matters?\\n\\nThat is certain.\\n\\nBeing is the sphere or subject-matter of knowledge, and knowledge is to\\nknow the nature of being?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd opinion is to have an opinion?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd do we know what we opine? or is the subject-matter of opinion the\\nsame as the subject-matter of knowledge?\\n\\nNay, he replied, that has been already disproven; if difference in\\nfaculty implies difference in the sphere or subject-matter, and if, as\\nwe were saying, opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties, then the\\nsphere of knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same.\\n\\nThen if being is the subject-matter of knowledge, something else must\\nbe the subject-matter of opinion?\\n\\nYes, something else.\\n\\nWell then, is not-being the subject-matter of opinion? or, rather, how\\ncan there be an opinion at all about not-being? Reflect: when a man has\\nan opinion, has he not an opinion about something? Can he have an\\nopinion which is an opinion about nothing?\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nHe who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd not-being is not one thing but, properly speaking, nothing?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nOf not-being, ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative; of\\nbeing, knowledge?\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nThen opinion is not concerned either with being or with not-being?\\n\\nNot with either.\\n\\nAnd can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?\\n\\nThat seems to be true.\\n\\nBut is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them, in a\\ngreater clearness than knowledge, or in a greater darkness than\\nignorance?\\n\\nIn neither.\\n\\nThen I suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge,\\nbut lighter than ignorance?\\n\\nBoth; and in no small degree.\\n\\nAnd also to be within and between them?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThen you would infer that opinion is intermediate?\\n\\nNo question.\\n\\nBut were we not saying before, that if anything appeared to be of a\\nsort which is and is not at the same time, that sort of thing would\\nappear also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute\\nnot-being; and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor\\nignorance, but will be found in the interval between them?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd in that interval there has now been discovered something which we\\ncall opinion?\\n\\nThere has.\\n\\nThen what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally\\nof the nature of being and not-being, and cannot rightly be termed\\neither, pure and simple; this unknown term, when discovered, we may\\ntruly call the subject of opinion, and assign each to their proper\\nfaculty,—the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to\\nthe faculty of the mean.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThis being premised, I would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that\\nthere is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty—in whose opinion\\nthe beautiful is the manifold—he, I say, your lover of beautiful\\nsights, who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one, and the\\njust is one, or that anything is one—to him I would appeal, saying,\\nWill you be so very kind, sir, as to tell us whether, of all these\\nbeautiful things, there is one which will not be found ugly; or of the\\njust, which will not be found unjust; or of the holy, which will not\\nalso be unholy?\\n\\nNo, he replied; the beautiful will in some point of view be found ugly;\\nand the same is true of the rest.\\n\\nAnd may not the many which are doubles be also halves?—doubles, that\\nis, of one thing, and halves of another?\\n\\nQuite true.\\n\\nAnd things great and small, heavy and light, as they are termed, will\\nnot be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names?\\n\\nTrue; both these and the opposite names will always attach to all of\\nthem.\\n\\nAnd can any one of those many things which are called by particular\\nnames be said to be this rather than not to be this?\\n\\nHe replied: They are like the punning riddles which are asked at feasts\\nor the children’s puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat, with what\\nhe hit him, as they say in the puzzle, and upon what the bat was\\nsitting. The individual objects of which I am speaking are also a\\nriddle, and have a double sense: nor can you fix them in your mind,\\neither as being or not-being, or both, or neither.\\n\\nThen what will you do with them? I said. Can they have a better place\\nthan between being and not-being? For they are clearly not in greater\\ndarkness or negation than not-being, or more full of light and\\nexistence than being.\\n\\nThat is quite true, he said.\\n\\nThus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the\\nmultitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are\\ntossing about in some region which is half-way between pure being and\\npure not-being?\\n\\nWe have.\\n\\nYes; and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we might\\nfind was to be described as matter of opinion, and not as matter of\\nknowledge; being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained by\\nthe intermediate faculty.\\n\\nQuite true.\\n\\nThen those who see the many beautiful, and who yet neither see absolute\\nbeauty, nor can follow any guide who points the way thither; who see\\nthe many just, and not absolute justice, and the like,—such persons may\\nbe said to have opinion but not knowledge?\\n\\nThat is certain.\\n\\nBut those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to\\nknow, and not to have opinion only?\\n\\nNeither can that be denied.\\n\\nThe one love and embrace the subjects of knowledge, the other those of\\nopinion? The latter are the same, as I dare say you will remember, who\\nlistened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours, but would not\\ntolerate the existence of absolute beauty.\\n\\nYes, I remember.\\n\\nShall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers of\\nopinion rather than lovers of wisdom, and will they be very angry with\\nus for thus describing them?\\n\\nI shall tell them not to be angry; no man should be angry at what is\\ntrue.\\n\\nBut those who love the truth in each thing are to be called lovers of\\nwisdom and not lovers of opinion.\\n\\nAssuredly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n BOOK VI.\\n\\n\\nAnd thus, Glaucon, after the argument has gone a weary way, the true\\nand the false philosophers have at length appeared in view.\\n\\nI do not think, he said, that the way could have been shortened.\\n\\nI suppose not, I said; and yet I believe that we might have had a\\nbetter view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined\\nto this one subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting\\nus, which he who desires to see in what respect the life of the just\\ndiffers from that of the unjust must consider.\\n\\nAnd what is the next question? he asked.\\n\\nSurely, I said, the one which follows next in order. Inasmuch as\\nphilosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable, and\\nthose who wander in the region of the many and variable are not\\nphilosophers, I must ask you which of the two classes should be the\\nrulers of our State?\\n\\nAnd how can we rightly answer that question?\\n\\nWhichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions\\nof our State—let them be our guardians.\\n\\nVery good.\\n\\nNeither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to\\nkeep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?\\n\\nThere can be no question of that.\\n\\nAnd are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge of\\nthe true being of each thing, and who have in their souls no clear\\npattern, and are unable as with a painter’s eye to look at the absolute\\ntruth and to that original to repair, and having perfect vision of the\\nother world to order the laws about beauty, goodness, justice in this,\\nif not already ordered, and to guard and preserve the order of them—are\\nnot such persons, I ask, simply blind?\\n\\nTruly, he replied, they are much in that condition.\\n\\nAnd shall they be our guardians when there are others who, besides\\nbeing their equals in experience and falling short of them in no\\nparticular of virtue, also know the very truth of each thing?\\n\\nThere can be no reason, he said, for rejecting those who have this\\ngreatest of all great qualities; they must always have the first place\\nunless they fail in some other respect.\\n\\nSuppose then, I said, that we determine how far they can unite this and\\nthe other excellences.\\n\\nBy all means.\\n\\nIn the first place, as we began by observing, the nature of the\\nphilosopher has to be ascertained. We must come to an understanding\\nabout him, and, when we have done so, then, if I am not mistaken, we\\nshall also acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible, and\\nthat those in whom they are united, and those only, should be rulers in\\nthe State.\\n\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nLet us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a sort\\nwhich shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and\\ncorruption.\\n\\nAgreed.\\n\\nAnd further, I said, let us agree that they are lovers of all true\\nbeing; there is no part whether greater or less, or more or less\\nhonourable, which they are willing to renounce; as we said before of\\nthe lover and the man of ambition.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd if they are to be what we were describing, is there not another\\nquality which they should also possess?\\n\\nWhat quality?\\n\\nTruthfulness: they will never intentionally receive into their mind\\nfalsehood, which is their detestation, and they will love the truth.\\n\\nYes, that may be safely affirmed of them.\\n\\n‘May be,’ my friend, I replied, is not the word; say rather ‘must be\\naffirmed:’ for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help\\nloving all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections.\\n\\nRight, he said.\\n\\nAnd is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth?\\n\\nHow can there be?\\n\\nCan the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood?\\n\\nNever.\\n\\nThe true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as far as\\nin him lies, desire all truth?\\n\\nAssuredly.\\n\\nBut then again, as we know by experience, he whose desires are strong\\nin one direction will have them weaker in others; they will be like a\\nstream which has been drawn off into another channel.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nHe whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be\\nabsorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and will hardly feel bodily\\npleasure—I mean, if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one.\\n\\nThat is most certain.\\n\\nSuch an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous; for\\nthe motives which make another man desirous of having and spending,\\nhave no place in his character.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnother criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be\\nconsidered.\\n\\nWhat is that?\\n\\nThere should be no secret corner of illiberality; nothing can be more\\nantagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the\\nwhole of things both divine and human.\\n\\nMost true, he replied.\\n\\nThen how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of\\nall time and all existence, think much of human life?\\n\\nHe cannot.\\n\\nOr can such an one account death fearful?\\n\\nNo indeed.\\n\\nThen the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nOr again: can he who is harmoniously constituted, who is not covetous\\nor mean, or a boaster, or a coward—can he, I say, ever be unjust or\\nhard in his dealings?\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nThen you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle, or rude\\nand unsociable; these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the\\nphilosophical nature from the unphilosophical.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThere is another point which should be remarked.\\n\\nWhat point?\\n\\nWhether he has or has not a pleasure in learning; for no one will love\\nthat which gives him pain, and in which after much toil he makes little\\nprogress.\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nAnd again, if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns,\\nwill he not be an empty vessel?\\n\\nThat is certain.\\n\\nLabouring in vain, he must end in hating himself and his fruitless\\noccupation? Yes.\\n\\nThen a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic\\nnatures; we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd once more, the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to\\ndisproportion?\\n\\nUndoubtedly.\\n\\nAnd do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion?\\n\\nTo proportion.\\n\\nThen, besides other qualities, we must try to find a naturally\\nwell-proportioned and gracious mind, which will move spontaneously\\ntowards the true being of everything.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nWell, and do not all these qualities, which we have been enumerating,\\ngo together, and are they not, in a manner, necessary to a soul, which\\nis to have a full and perfect participation of being?\\n\\nThey are absolutely necessary, he replied.\\n\\nAnd must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who has\\nthe gift of a good memory, and is quick to learn,—noble, gracious, the\\nfriend of truth, justice, courage, temperance, who are his kindred?\\n\\nThe god of jealousy himself, he said, could find no fault with such a\\nstudy.\\n\\nAnd to men like him, I said, when perfected by years and education, and\\nto these only you will entrust the State.\\n\\nHere Adeimantus interposed and said: To these statements, Socrates, no\\none can offer a reply; but when you talk in this way, a strange feeling\\npasses over the minds of your hearers: They fancy that they are led\\nastray a little at each step in the argument, owing to their own want\\nof skill in asking and answering questions; these littles accumulate,\\nand at the end of the discussion they are found to have sustained a\\nmighty overthrow and all their former notions appear to be turned\\nupside down. And as unskilful players of draughts are at last shut up\\nby their more skilful adversaries and have no piece to move, so they\\ntoo find themselves shut up at last; for they have nothing to say in\\nthis new game of which words are the counters; and yet all the time\\nthey are in the right. The observation is suggested to me by what is\\nnow occurring. For any one of us might say, that although in words he\\nis not able to meet you at each step of the argument, he sees as a fact\\nthat the votaries of philosophy, when they carry on the study, not only\\nin youth as a part of education, but as the pursuit of their maturer\\nyears, most of them become strange monsters, not to say utter rogues,\\nand that those who may be considered the best of them are made useless\\nto the world by the very study which you extol.\\n\\nWell, and do you think that those who say so are wrong?\\n\\nI cannot tell, he replied; but I should like to know what is your\\nopinion.\\n\\nHear my answer; I am of opinion that they are quite right.\\n\\nThen how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease from\\nevil until philosophers rule in them, when philosophers are\\nacknowledged by us to be of no use to them?\\n\\nYou ask a question, I said, to which a reply can only be given in a\\nparable.\\n\\nYes, Socrates; and that is a way of speaking to which you are not at\\nall accustomed, I suppose.\\n\\nI perceive, I said, that you are vastly amused at having plunged me\\ninto such a hopeless discussion; but now hear the parable, and then you\\nwill be still more amused at the meagreness of my imagination: for the\\nmanner in which the best men are treated in their own States is so\\ngrievous that no single thing on earth is comparable to it; and\\ntherefore, if I am to plead their cause, I must have recourse to\\nfiction, and put together a figure made up of many things, like the\\nfabulous unions of goats and stags which are found in pictures. Imagine\\nthen a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is taller and\\nstronger than any of the crew, but he is a little deaf and has a\\nsimilar infirmity in sight, and his knowledge of navigation is not much\\nbetter. The sailors are quarrelling with one another about the\\nsteering—every one is of opinion that he has a right to steer, though\\nhe has never learned the art of navigation and cannot tell who taught\\nhim or when he learned, and will further assert that it cannot be\\ntaught, and they are ready to cut in pieces any one who says the\\ncontrary. They throng about the captain, begging and praying him to\\ncommit the helm to them; and if at any time they do not prevail, but\\nothers are preferred to them, they kill the others or throw them\\noverboard, and having first chained up the noble captain’s senses with\\ndrink or some narcotic drug, they mutiny and take possession of the\\nship and make free with the stores; thus, eating and drinking, they\\nproceed on their voyage in such manner as might be expected of them.\\nHim who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their plot for\\ngetting the ship out of the captain’s hands into their own whether by\\nforce or persuasion, they compliment with the name of sailor, pilot,\\nable seaman, and abuse the other sort of man, whom they call a\\ngood-for-nothing; but that the true pilot must pay attention to the\\nyear and seasons and sky and stars and winds, and whatever else belongs\\nto his art, if he intends to be really qualified for the command of a\\nship, and that he must and will be the steerer, whether other people\\nlike or not—the possibility of this union of authority with the\\nsteerer’s art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been\\nmade part of their calling. Now in vessels which are in a state of\\nmutiny and by sailors who are mutineers, how will the true pilot be\\nregarded? Will he not be called by them a prater, a star-gazer, a\\ngood-for-nothing?\\n\\nOf course, said Adeimantus.\\n\\nThen you will hardly need, I said, to hear the interpretation of the\\nfigure, which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the\\nState; for you understand already.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThen suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is\\nsurprised at finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities;\\nexplain it to him and try to convince him that their having honour\\nwould be far more extraordinary.\\n\\nI will.\\n\\nSay to him, that, in deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be\\nuseless to the rest of the world, he is right; but also tell him to\\nattribute their uselessness to the fault of those who will not use\\nthem, and not to themselves. The pilot should not humbly beg the\\nsailors to be commanded by him—that is not the order of nature; neither\\nare ‘the wise to go to the doors of the rich’—the ingenious author of\\nthis saying told a lie—but the truth is, that, when a man is ill,\\nwhether he be rich or poor, to the physician he must go, and he who\\nwants to be governed, to him who is able to govern. The ruler who is\\ngood for anything ought not to beg his subjects to be ruled by him;\\nalthough the present governors of mankind are of a different stamp;\\nthey may be justly compared to the mutinous sailors, and the true\\nhelmsmen to those who are called by them good-for-nothings and\\nstar-gazers.\\n\\nPrecisely so, he said.\\n\\nFor these reasons, and among men like these, philosophy, the noblest\\npursuit of all, is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the\\nopposite faction; not that the greatest and most lasting injury is done\\nto her by her opponents, but by her own professing followers, the same\\nof whom you suppose the accuser to say, that the greater number of them\\nare arrant rogues, and the best are useless; in which opinion I agreed.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd the reason why the good are useless has now been explained?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThen shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is\\nalso unavoidable, and that this is not to be laid to the charge of\\nphilosophy any more than the other?\\n\\nBy all means.\\n\\nAnd let us ask and answer in turn, first going back to the description\\nof the gentle and noble nature. Truth, as you will remember, was his\\nleader, whom he followed always and in all things; failing in this, he\\nwas an impostor, and had no part or lot in true philosophy.\\n\\nYes, that was said.\\n\\nWell, and is not this one quality, to mention no others, greatly at\\nvariance with present notions of him?\\n\\nCertainly, he said.\\n\\nAnd have we not a right to say in his defence, that the true lover of\\nknowledge is always striving after being—that is his nature; he will\\nnot rest in the multiplicity of individuals which is an appearance\\nonly, but will go on—the keen edge will not be blunted, nor the force\\nof his desire abate until he have attained the knowledge of the true\\nnature of every essence by a sympathetic and kindred power in the soul,\\nand by that power drawing near and mingling and becoming incorporate\\nwith very being, having begotten mind and truth, he will have knowledge\\nand will live and grow truly, and then, and not till then, will he\\ncease from his travail.\\n\\nNothing, he said, can be more just than such a description of him.\\n\\nAnd will the love of a lie be any part of a philosopher’s nature? Will\\nhe not utterly hate a lie?\\n\\nHe will.\\n\\nAnd when truth is the captain, we cannot suspect any evil of the band\\nwhich he leads?\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nJustice and health of mind will be of the company, and temperance will\\nfollow after?\\n\\nTrue, he replied.\\n\\nNeither is there any reason why I should again set in array the\\nphilosopher’s virtues, as you will doubtless remember that courage,\\nmagnificence, apprehension, memory, were his natural gifts. And you\\nobjected that, although no one could deny what I then said, still, if\\nyou leave words and look at facts, the persons who are thus described\\nare some of them manifestly useless, and the greater number utterly\\ndepraved; we were then led to enquire into the grounds of these\\naccusations, and have now arrived at the point of asking why are the\\nmajority bad, which question of necessity brought us back to the\\nexamination and definition of the true philosopher.\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nAnd we have next to consider the corruptions of the philosophic nature,\\nwhy so many are spoiled and so few escape spoiling—I am speaking of\\nthose who were said to be useless but not wicked—and, when we have done\\nwith them, we will speak of the imitators of philosophy, what manner of\\nmen are they who aspire after a profession which is above them and of\\nwhich they are unworthy, and then, by their manifold inconsistencies,\\nbring upon philosophy, and upon all philosophers, that universal\\nreprobation of which we speak.\\n\\nWhat are these corruptions? he said.\\n\\nI will see if I can explain them to you. Every one will admit that a\\nnature having in perfection all the qualities which we required in a\\nphilosopher, is a rare plant which is seldom seen among men.\\n\\nRare indeed.\\n\\nAnd what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare\\nnatures!\\n\\nWhat causes?\\n\\nIn the first place there are their own virtues, their courage,\\ntemperance, and the rest of them, every one of which praiseworthy\\nqualities (and this is a most singular circumstance) destroys and\\ndistracts from philosophy the soul which is the possessor of them.\\n\\nThat is very singular, he replied.\\n\\nThen there are all the ordinary goods of life—beauty, wealth, strength,\\nrank, and great connections in the State—you understand the sort of\\nthings—these also have a corrupting and distracting effect.\\n\\nI understand; but I should like to know more precisely what you mean\\nabout them.\\n\\nGrasp the truth as a whole, I said, and in the right way; you will then\\nhave no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks, and they will\\nno longer appear strange to you.\\n\\nAnd how am I to do so? he asked.\\n\\nWhy, I said, we know that all germs or seeds, whether vegetable or\\nanimal, when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or\\nsoil, in proportion to their vigour, are all the more sensitive to the\\nwant of a suitable environment, for evil is a greater enemy to what is\\ngood than to what is not.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nThere is reason in supposing that the finest natures, when under alien\\nconditions, receive more injury than the inferior, because the contrast\\nis greater.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd may we not say, Adeimantus, that the most gifted minds, when they\\nare ill-educated, become pre-eminently bad? Do not great crimes and the\\nspirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by\\neducation rather than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are\\nscarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil?\\n\\nThere I think that you are right.\\n\\nAnd our philosopher follows the same analogy—he is like a plant which,\\nhaving proper nurture, must necessarily grow and mature into all\\nvirtue, but, if sown and planted in an alien soil, becomes the most\\nnoxious of all weeds, unless he be preserved by some divine power. Do\\nyou really think, as people so often say, that our youth are corrupted\\nby Sophists, or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any\\ndegree worth speaking of? Are not the public who say these things the\\ngreatest of all Sophists? And do they not educate to perfection young\\nand old, men and women alike, and fashion them after their own hearts?\\n\\nWhen is this accomplished? he said.\\n\\nWhen they meet together, and the world sits down at an assembly, or in\\na court of law, or a theatre, or a camp, or in any other popular\\nresort, and there is a great uproar, and they praise some things which\\nare being said or done, and blame other things, equally exaggerating\\nboth, shouting and clapping their hands, and the echo of the rocks and\\nthe place in which they are assembled redoubles the sound of the praise\\nor blame—at such a time will not a young man’s heart, as they say, leap\\nwithin him? Will any private training enable him to stand firm against\\nthe overwhelming flood of popular opinion? or will he be carried away\\nby the stream? Will he not have the notions of good and evil which the\\npublic in general have—he will do as they do, and as they are, such\\nwill he be?\\n\\nYes, Socrates; necessity will compel him.\\n\\nAnd yet, I said, there is a still greater necessity, which has not been\\nmentioned.\\n\\nWhat is that?\\n\\nThe gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death, which, as you\\nare aware, these new Sophists and educators, who are the public, apply\\nwhen their words are powerless.\\n\\nIndeed they do; and in right good earnest.\\n\\nNow what opinion of any other Sophist, or of any private person, can be\\nexpected to overcome in such an unequal contest?\\n\\nNone, he replied.\\n\\nNo, indeed, I said, even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly;\\nthere neither is, nor has been, nor is ever likely to be, any different\\ntype of character which has had no other training in virtue but that\\nwhich is supplied by public opinion—I speak, my friend, of human virtue\\nonly; what is more than human, as the proverb says, is not included:\\nfor I would not have you ignorant that, in the present evil state of\\ngovernments, whatever is saved and comes to good is saved by the power\\nof God, as we may truly say.\\n\\nI quite assent, he replied.\\n\\nThen let me crave your assent also to a further observation.\\n\\nWhat are you going to say?\\n\\nWhy, that all those mercenary individuals, whom the many call Sophists\\nand whom they deem to be their adversaries, do, in fact, teach nothing\\nbut the opinion of the many, that is to say, the opinions of their\\nassemblies; and this is their wisdom. I might compare them to a man who\\nshould study the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who is\\nfed by him—he would learn how to approach and handle him, also at what\\ntimes and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse, and what is\\nthe meaning of his several cries, and by what sounds, when another\\nutters them, he is soothed or infuriated; and you may suppose further,\\nthat when, by continually attending upon him, he has become perfect in\\nall this, he calls his knowledge wisdom, and makes of it a system or\\nart, which he proceeds to teach, although he has no real notion of what\\nhe means by the principles or passions of which he is speaking, but\\ncalls this honourable and that dishonourable, or good or evil, or just\\nor unjust, all in accordance with the tastes and tempers of the great\\nbrute. Good he pronounces to be that in which the beast delights and\\nevil to be that which he dislikes; and he can give no other account of\\nthem except that the just and noble are the necessary, having never\\nhimself seen, and having no power of explaining to others the nature of\\neither, or the difference between them, which is immense. By heaven,\\nwould not such an one be a rare educator?\\n\\nIndeed he would.\\n\\nAnd in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of\\nthe tempers and tastes of the motley multitude, whether in painting or\\nmusic, or, finally, in politics, differ from him whom I have been\\ndescribing? For when a man consorts with the many, and exhibits to them\\nhis poem or other work of art or the service which he has done the\\nState, making them his judges when he is not obliged, the so-called\\nnecessity of Diomede will oblige him to produce whatever they praise.\\nAnd yet the reasons are utterly ludicrous which they give in\\nconfirmation of their own notions about the honourable and good. Did\\nyou ever hear any of them which were not?\\n\\nNo, nor am I likely to hear.\\n\\nYou recognise the truth of what I have been saying? Then let me ask you\\nto consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe\\nin the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful,\\nor of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nThen the world cannot possibly be a philosopher?\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nAnd therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure of\\nthe world?\\n\\nThey must.\\n\\nAnd of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them?\\n\\nThat is evident.\\n\\nThen, do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved in\\nhis calling to the end? and remember what we were saying of him, that\\nhe was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence—these\\nwere admitted by us to be the true philosopher’s gifts.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nWill not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first\\namong all, especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental\\nones?\\n\\nCertainly, he said.\\n\\nAnd his friends and fellow-citizens will want to use him as he gets\\nolder for their own purposes?\\n\\nNo question.\\n\\nFalling at his feet, they will make requests to him and do him honour\\nand flatter him, because they want to get into their hands now, the\\npower which he will one day possess.\\n\\nThat often happens, he said.\\n\\nAnd what will a man such as he is be likely to do under such\\ncircumstances, especially if he be a citizen of a great city, rich and\\nnoble, and a tall proper youth? Will he not be full of boundless\\naspirations, and fancy himself able to manage the affairs of Hellenes\\nand of barbarians, and having got such notions into his head will he\\nnot dilate and elevate himself in the fulness of vain pomp and\\nsenseless pride?\\n\\nTo be sure he will.\\n\\nNow, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to him\\nand tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding, which can\\nonly be got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse\\ncircumstances, he will be easily induced to listen?\\n\\nFar otherwise.\\n\\nAnd even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural\\nreasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and\\ntaken captive by philosophy, how will his friends behave when they\\nthink that they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping\\nto reap from his companionship? Will they not do and say anything to\\nprevent him from yielding to his better nature and to render his\\nteacher powerless, using to this end private intrigues as well as\\npublic prosecutions?\\n\\nThere can be no doubt of it.\\n\\nAnd how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher?\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nThen were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which\\nmake a man a philosopher may, if he be ill-educated, divert him from\\nphilosophy, no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other\\nso-called goods of life?\\n\\nWe were quite right.\\n\\nThus, my excellent friend, is brought about all that ruin and failure\\nwhich I have been describing of the natures best adapted to the best of\\nall pursuits; they are natures which we maintain to be rare at any\\ntime; this being the class out of which come the men who are the\\nauthors of the greatest evil to States and individuals; and also of the\\ngreatest good when the tide carries them in that direction; but a small\\nman never was the doer of any great thing either to individuals or to\\nStates.\\n\\nThat is most true, he said.\\n\\nAnd so philosophy is left desolate, with her marriage rite incomplete:\\nfor her own have fallen away and forsaken her, and while they are\\nleading a false and unbecoming life, other unworthy persons, seeing\\nthat she has no kinsmen to be her protectors, enter in and dishonour\\nher; and fasten upon her the reproaches which, as you say, her\\nreprovers utter, who affirm of her votaries that some are good for\\nnothing, and that the greater number deserve the severest punishment.\\n\\nThat is certainly what people say.\\n\\nYes; and what else would you expect, I said, when you think of the puny\\ncreatures who, seeing this land open to them—a land well stocked with\\nfair names and showy titles—like prisoners running out of prison into a\\nsanctuary, take a leap out of their trades into philosophy; those who\\ndo so being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable crafts?\\nFor, although philosophy be in this evil case, still there remains a\\ndignity about her which is not to be found in the arts. And many are\\nthus attracted by her whose natures are imperfect and whose souls are\\nmaimed and disfigured by their meannesses, as their bodies are by their\\ntrades and crafts. Is not this unavoidable?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAre they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out of\\ndurance and come into a fortune; he takes a bath and puts on a new\\ncoat, and is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his master’s\\ndaughter, who is left poor and desolate?\\n\\nA most exact parallel.\\n\\nWhat will be the issue of such marriages? Will they not be vile and\\nbastard?\\n\\nThere can be no question of it.\\n\\nAnd when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy and\\nmake an alliance with her who is in a rank above them what sort of\\nideas and opinions are likely to be generated? Will they not be\\nsophisms captivating to the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or\\nworthy of or akin to true wisdom?\\n\\nNo doubt, he said.\\n\\nThen, Adeimantus, I said, the worthy disciples of philosophy will be\\nbut a small remnant: perchance some noble and well-educated person,\\ndetained by exile in her service, who in the absence of corrupting\\ninfluences remains devoted to her; or some lofty soul born in a mean\\ncity, the politics of which he contemns and neglects; and there may be\\na gifted few who leave the arts, which they justly despise, and come to\\nher;—or peradventure there are some who are restrained by our friend\\nTheages’ bridle; for everything in the life of Theages conspired to\\ndivert him from philosophy; but ill-health kept him away from politics.\\nMy own case of the internal sign is hardly worth mentioning, for\\nrarely, if ever, has such a monitor been given to any other man. Those\\nwho belong to this small class have tasted how sweet and blessed a\\npossession philosophy is, and have also seen enough of the madness of\\nthe multitude; and they know that no politician is honest, nor is there\\nany champion of justice at whose side they may fight and be saved. Such\\nan one may be compared to a man who has fallen among wild beasts—he\\nwill not join in the wickedness of his fellows, but neither is he able\\nsingly to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore seeing that he\\nwould be of no use to the State or to his friends, and reflecting that\\nhe would have to throw away his life without doing any good either to\\nhimself or others, he holds his peace, and goes his own way. He is like\\none who, in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries\\nalong, retires under the shelter of a wall; and seeing the rest of\\nmankind full of wickedness, he is content, if only he can live his own\\nlife and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and\\ngood-will, with bright hopes.\\n\\nYes, he said, and he will have done a great work before he departs.\\n\\nA great work—yes; but not the greatest, unless he find a State suitable\\nto him; for in a State which is suitable to him, he will have a larger\\ngrowth and be the saviour of his country, as well as of himself.\\n\\nThe causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been\\nsufficiently explained: the injustice of the charges against her has\\nbeen shown—is there anything more which you wish to say?\\n\\nNothing more on that subject, he replied; but I should like to know\\nwhich of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one\\nadapted to her.\\n\\nNot any of them, I said; and that is precisely the accusation which I\\nbring against them—not one of them is worthy of the philosophic nature,\\nand hence that nature is warped and estranged;—as the exotic seed which\\nis sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized, and is wont to be\\noverpowered and to lose itself in the new soil, even so this growth of\\nphilosophy, instead of persisting, degenerates and receives another\\ncharacter. But if philosophy ever finds in the State that perfection\\nwhich she herself is, then will be seen that she is in truth divine,\\nand that all other things, whether natures of men or institutions, are\\nbut human;—and now, I know, that you are going to ask, What that State\\nis:\\n\\nNo, he said; there you are wrong, for I was going to ask another\\nquestion—whether it is the State of which we are the founders and\\ninventors, or some other?\\n\\nYes, I replied, ours in most respects; but you may remember my saying\\nbefore, that some living authority would always be required in the\\nState having the same idea of the constitution which guided you when as\\nlegislator you were laying down the laws.\\n\\nThat was said, he replied.\\n\\nYes, but not in a satisfactory manner; you frightened us by interposing\\nobjections, which certainly showed that the discussion would be long\\nand difficult; and what still remains is the reverse of easy.\\n\\nWhat is there remaining?\\n\\nThe question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not to be\\nthe ruin of the State: All great attempts are attended with risk; ‘hard\\nis the good,’ as men say.\\n\\nStill, he said, let the point be cleared up, and the enquiry will then\\nbe complete.\\n\\nI shall not be hindered, I said, by any want of will, but, if at all,\\nby a want of power: my zeal you may see for yourselves; and please to\\nremark in what I am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly I\\ndeclare that States should pursue philosophy, not as they do now, but\\nin a different spirit.\\n\\nIn what manner?\\n\\nAt present, I said, the students of philosophy are quite young;\\nbeginning when they are hardly past childhood, they devote only the\\ntime saved from moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits; and even\\nthose of them who are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit,\\nwhen they come within sight of the great difficulty of the subject, I\\nmean dialectic, take themselves off. In after life when invited by some\\none else, they may, perhaps, go and hear a lecture, and about this they\\nmake much ado, for philosophy is not considered by them to be their\\nproper business: at last, when they grow old, in most cases they are\\nextinguished more truly than Heracleitus’ sun, inasmuch as they never\\nlight up again. (Heraclitus said that the sun was extinguished every\\nevening and relighted every morning.)\\n\\nBut what ought to be their course?\\n\\nJust the opposite. In childhood and youth their study, and what\\nphilosophy they learn, should be suited to their tender years: during\\nthis period while they are growing up towards manhood, the chief and\\nspecial care should be given to their bodies that they may have them to\\nuse in the service of philosophy; as life advances and the intellect\\nbegins to mature, let them increase the gymnastics of the soul; but\\nwhen the strength of our citizens fails and is past civil and military\\nduties, then let them range at will and engage in no serious labour, as\\nwe intend them to live happily here, and to crown this life with a\\nsimilar happiness in another.\\n\\nHow truly in earnest you are, Socrates! he said; I am sure of that; and\\nyet most of your hearers, if I am not mistaken, are likely to be still\\nmore earnest in their opposition to you, and will never be convinced;\\nThrasymachus least of all.\\n\\nDo not make a quarrel, I said, between Thrasymachus and me, who have\\nrecently become friends, although, indeed, we were never enemies; for I\\nshall go on striving to the utmost until I either convert him and other\\nmen, or do something which may profit them against the day when they\\nlive again, and hold the like discourse in another state of existence.\\n\\nYou are speaking of a time which is not very near.\\n\\nRather, I replied, of a time which is as nothing in comparison with\\neternity. Nevertheless, I do not wonder that the many refuse to\\nbelieve; for they have never seen that of which we are now speaking\\nrealized; they have seen only a conventional imitation of philosophy,\\nconsisting of words artificially brought together, not like these of\\nours having a natural unity. But a human being who in word and work is\\nperfectly moulded, as far as he can be, into the proportion and\\nlikeness of virtue—such a man ruling in a city which bears the same\\nimage, they have never yet seen, neither one nor many of them—do you\\nthink that they ever did?\\n\\nNo indeed.\\n\\nNo, my friend, and they have seldom, if ever, heard free and noble\\nsentiments; such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every\\nmeans in their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge,\\nwhile they look coldly on the subtleties of controversy, of which the\\nend is opinion and strife, whether they meet with them in the courts of\\nlaw or in society.\\n\\nThey are strangers, he said, to the words of which you speak.\\n\\nAnd this was what we foresaw, and this was the reason why truth forced\\nus to admit, not without fear and hesitation, that neither cities nor\\nStates nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small\\nclass of philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are\\nprovidentially compelled, whether they will or not, to take care of the\\nState, and until a like necessity be laid on the State to obey them; or\\nuntil kings, or if not kings, the sons of kings or princes, are\\ndivinely inspired with a true love of true philosophy. That either or\\nboth of these alternatives are impossible, I see no reason to affirm:\\nif they were so, we might indeed be justly ridiculed as dreamers and\\nvisionaries. Am I not right?\\n\\nQuite right.\\n\\nIf then, in the countless ages of the past, or at the present hour in\\nsome foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken, the perfected\\nphilosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a\\nsuperior power to have the charge of the State, we are ready to assert\\nto the death, that this our constitution has been, and is—yea, and will\\nbe whenever the Muse of Philosophy is queen. There is no impossibility\\nin all this; that there is a difficulty, we acknowledge ourselves.\\n\\nMy opinion agrees with yours, he said.\\n\\nBut do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude?\\n\\nI should imagine not, he replied.\\n\\nO my friend, I said, do not attack the multitude: they will change\\ntheir minds, if, not in an aggressive spirit, but gently and with the\\nview of soothing them and removing their dislike of over-education, you\\nshow them your philosophers as they really are and describe as you were\\njust now doing their character and profession, and then mankind will\\nsee that he of whom you are speaking is not such as they supposed—if\\nthey view him in this new light, they will surely change their notion\\nof him, and answer in another strain. Who can be at enmity with one who\\nloves them, who that is himself gentle and free from envy will be\\njealous of one in whom there is no jealousy? Nay, let me answer for\\nyou, that in a few this harsh temper may be found but not in the\\nmajority of mankind.\\n\\nI quite agree with you, he said.\\n\\nAnd do you not also think, as I do, that the harsh feeling which the\\nmany entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders, who\\nrush in uninvited, and are always abusing them, and finding fault with\\nthem, who make persons instead of things the theme of their\\nconversation? and nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than\\nthis.\\n\\nIt is most unbecoming.\\n\\nFor he, Adeimantus, whose mind is fixed upon true being, has surely no\\ntime to look down upon the affairs of earth, or to be filled with\\nmalice and envy, contending against men; his eye is ever directed\\ntowards things fixed and immutable, which he sees neither injuring nor\\ninjured by one another, but all in order moving according to reason;\\nthese he imitates, and to these he will, as far as he can, conform\\nhimself. Can a man help imitating that with which he holds reverential\\nconverse?\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nAnd the philosopher holding converse with the divine order, becomes\\norderly and divine, as far as the nature of man allows; but like every\\none else, he will suffer from detraction.\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nAnd if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning, not only himself,\\nbut human nature generally, whether in States or individuals, into that\\nwhich he beholds elsewhere, will he, think you, be an unskilful\\nartificer of justice, temperance, and every civil virtue?\\n\\nAnything but unskilful.\\n\\nAnd if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the\\ntruth, will they be angry with philosophy? Will they disbelieve us,\\nwhen we tell them that no State can be happy which is not designed by\\nartists who imitate the heavenly pattern?\\n\\nThey will not be angry if they understand, he said. But how will they\\ndraw out the plan of which you are speaking?\\n\\nThey will begin by taking the State and the manners of men, from which,\\nas from a tablet, they will rub out the picture, and leave a clean\\nsurface. This is no easy task. But whether easy or not, herein will lie\\nthe difference between them and every other legislator,—they will have\\nnothing to do either with individual or State, and will inscribe no\\nlaws, until they have either found, or themselves made, a clean\\nsurface.\\n\\nThey will be very right, he said.\\n\\nHaving effected this, they will proceed to trace an outline of the\\nconstitution?\\n\\nNo doubt.\\n\\nAnd when they are filling in the work, as I conceive, they will often\\nturn their eyes upwards and downwards: I mean that they will first look\\nat absolute justice and beauty and temperance, and again at the human\\ncopy; and will mingle and temper the various elements of life into the\\nimage of a man; and this they will conceive according to that other\\nimage, which, when existing among men, Homer calls the form and\\nlikeness of God.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nAnd one feature they will erase, and another they will put in, until\\nthey have made the ways of men, as far as possible, agreeable to the\\nways of God?\\n\\nIndeed, he said, in no way could they make a fairer picture.\\n\\nAnd now, I said, are we beginning to persuade those whom you described\\nas rushing at us with might and main, that the painter of constitutions\\nis such an one as we are praising; at whom they were so very indignant\\nbecause to his hands we committed the State; and are they growing a\\nlittle calmer at what they have just heard?\\n\\nMuch calmer, if there is any sense in them.\\n\\nWhy, where can they still find any ground for objection? Will they\\ndoubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being?\\n\\nThey would not be so unreasonable.\\n\\nOr that his nature, being such as we have delineated, is akin to the\\nhighest good?\\n\\nNeither can they doubt this.\\n\\nBut again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under\\nfavourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any\\never was? Or will they prefer those whom we have rejected?\\n\\nSurely not.\\n\\nThen will they still be angry at our saying, that, until philosophers\\nbear rule, States and individuals will have no rest from evil, nor will\\nthis our imaginary State ever be realized?\\n\\nI think that they will be less angry.\\n\\nShall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle, and\\nthat they have been converted and for very shame, if for no other\\nreason, cannot refuse to come to terms?\\n\\nBy all means, he said.\\n\\nThen let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected. Will any\\none deny the other point, that there may be sons of kings or princes\\nwho are by nature philosophers?\\n\\nSurely no man, he said.\\n\\nAnd when they have come into being will any one say that they must of\\nnecessity be destroyed; that they can hardly be saved is not denied\\neven by us; but that in the whole course of ages no single one of them\\ncan escape—who will venture to affirm this?\\n\\nWho indeed!\\n\\nBut, said I, one is enough; let there be one man who has a city\\nobedient to his will, and he might bring into existence the ideal\\npolity about which the world is so incredulous.\\n\\nYes, one is enough.\\n\\nThe ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been\\ndescribing, and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd that others should approve, of what we approve, is no miracle or\\nimpossibility?\\n\\nI think not.\\n\\nBut we have sufficiently shown, in what has preceded, that all this, if\\nonly possible, is assuredly for the best.\\n\\nWe have.\\n\\nAnd now we say not only that our laws, if they could be enacted, would\\nbe for the best, but also that the enactment of them, though difficult,\\nis not impossible.\\n\\nVery good.\\n\\nAnd so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject, but\\nmore remains to be discussed;—how and by what studies and pursuits will\\nthe saviours of the constitution be created, and at what ages are they\\nto apply themselves to their several studies?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nI omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women, and the\\nprocreation of children, and the appointment of the rulers, because I\\nknew that the perfect State would be eyed with jealousy and was\\ndifficult of attainment; but that piece of cleverness was not of much\\nservice to me, for I had to discuss them all the same. The women and\\nchildren are now disposed of, but the other question of the rulers must\\nbe investigated from the very beginning. We were saying, as you will\\nremember, that they were to be lovers of their country, tried by the\\ntest of pleasures and pains, and neither in hardships, nor in dangers,\\nnor at any other critical moment were to lose their patriotism—he was\\nto be rejected who failed, but he who always came forth pure, like gold\\ntried in the refiner’s fire, was to be made a ruler, and to receive\\nhonours and rewards in life and after death. This was the sort of thing\\nwhich was being said, and then the argument turned aside and veiled her\\nface; not liking to stir the question which has now arisen.\\n\\nI perfectly remember, he said.\\n\\nYes, my friend, I said, and I then shrank from hazarding the bold word;\\nbut now let me dare to say—that the perfect guardian must be a\\nphilosopher.\\n\\nYes, he said, let that be affirmed.\\n\\nAnd do not suppose that there will be many of them; for the gifts which\\nwere deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together; they are mostly\\nfound in shreds and patches.\\n\\nWhat do you mean? he said.\\n\\nYou are aware, I replied, that quick intelligence, memory, sagacity,\\ncleverness, and similar qualities, do not often grow together, and that\\npersons who possess them and are at the same time high-spirited and\\nmagnanimous are not so constituted by nature as to live orderly and in\\na peaceful and settled manner; they are driven any way by their\\nimpulses, and all solid principle goes out of them.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nOn the other hand, those steadfast natures which can better be depended\\nupon, which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable, are\\nequally immovable when there is anything to be learned; they are always\\nin a torpid state, and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any\\nintellectual toil.\\n\\nQuite true.\\n\\nAnd yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those to\\nwhom the higher education is to be imparted, and who are to share in\\nany office or command.\\n\\nCertainly, he said.\\n\\nAnd will they be a class which is rarely found?\\n\\nYes, indeed.\\n\\nThen the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and dangers\\nand pleasures which we mentioned before, but there is another kind of\\nprobation which we did not mention—he must be exercised also in many\\nkinds of knowledge, to see whether the soul will be able to endure the\\nhighest of all, or will faint under them, as in any other studies and\\nexercises.\\n\\nYes, he said, you are quite right in testing him. But what do you mean\\nby the highest of all knowledge?\\n\\nYou may remember, I said, that we divided the soul into three parts;\\nand distinguished the several natures of justice, temperance, courage,\\nand wisdom?\\n\\nIndeed, he said, if I had forgotten, I should not deserve to hear more.\\n\\nAnd do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion\\nof them?\\n\\nTo what do you refer?\\n\\nWe were saying, if I am not mistaken, that he who wanted to see them in\\ntheir perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way, at the\\nend of which they would appear; but that we could add on a popular\\nexposition of them on a level with the discussion which had preceded.\\nAnd you replied that such an exposition would be enough for you, and so\\nthe enquiry was continued in what to me seemed to be a very inaccurate\\nmanner; whether you were satisfied or not, it is for you to say.\\n\\nYes, he said, I thought and the others thought that you gave us a fair\\nmeasure of truth.\\n\\nBut, my friend, I said, a measure of such things which in any degree\\nfalls short of the whole truth is not fair measure; for nothing\\nimperfect is the measure of anything, although persons are too apt to\\nbe contented and think that they need search no further.\\n\\nNot an uncommon case when people are indolent.\\n\\nYes, I said; and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the\\nState and of the laws.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThe guardian then, I said, must be required to take the longer circuit,\\nand toil at learning as well as at gymnastics, or he will never reach\\nthe highest knowledge of all which, as we were just now saying, is his\\nproper calling.\\n\\nWhat, he said, is there a knowledge still higher than this—higher than\\njustice and the other virtues?\\n\\nYes, I said, there is. And of the virtues too we must behold not the\\noutline merely, as at present—nothing short of the most finished\\npicture should satisfy us. When little things are elaborated with an\\ninfinity of pains, in order that they may appear in their full beauty\\nand utmost clearness, how ridiculous that we should not think the\\nhighest truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy!\\n\\nA right noble thought; but do you suppose that we shall refrain from\\nasking you what is this highest knowledge?\\n\\nNay, I said, ask if you will; but I am certain that you have heard the\\nanswer many times, and now you either do not understand me or, as I\\nrather think, you are disposed to be troublesome; for you have often\\nbeen told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge, and that all\\nother things become useful and advantageous only by their use of this.\\nYou can hardly be ignorant that of this I was about to speak,\\nconcerning which, as you have often heard me say, we know so little;\\nand, without which, any other knowledge or possession of any kind will\\nprofit us nothing. Do you think that the possession of all other things\\nis of any value if we do not possess the good? or the knowledge of all\\nother things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness?\\n\\nAssuredly not.\\n\\nYou are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good,\\nbut the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by\\nknowledge, but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good?\\n\\nHow ridiculous!\\n\\nYes, I said, that they should begin by reproaching us with our\\nignorance of the good, and then presume our knowledge of it—for the\\ngood they define to be knowledge of the good, just as if we understood\\nthem when they use the term ‘good’—this is of course ridiculous.\\n\\nMost true, he said.\\n\\nAnd those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity; for\\nthey are compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as\\ngood.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThere can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this\\nquestion is involved.\\n\\nThere can be none.\\n\\nFurther, do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or to\\nseem to be what is just and honourable without the reality; but no one\\nis satisfied with the appearance of good—the reality is what they seek;\\nin the case of the good, appearance is despised by every one.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nOf this then, which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of all\\nhis actions, having a presentiment that there is such an end, and yet\\nhesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the same\\nassurance of this as of other things, and therefore losing whatever\\ngood there is in other things,—of a principle such and so great as this\\nought the best men in our State, to whom everything is entrusted, to be\\nin the darkness of ignorance?\\n\\nCertainly not, he said.\\n\\nI am sure, I said, that he who does not know how the beautiful and the\\njust are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them; and I\\nsuspect that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true\\nknowledge of them.\\n\\nThat, he said, is a shrewd suspicion of yours.\\n\\nAnd if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our State will be\\nperfectly ordered?\\n\\nOf course, he replied; but I wish that you would tell me whether you\\nconceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or\\npleasure, or different from either?\\n\\nAye, I said, I knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you\\nwould not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these\\nmatters.\\n\\nTrue, Socrates; but I must say that one who like you has passed a\\nlifetime in the study of philosophy should not be always repeating the\\nopinions of others, and never telling his own.\\n\\nWell, but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know?\\n\\nNot, he said, with the assurance of positive certainty; he has no right\\nto do that: but he may say what he thinks, as a matter of opinion.\\n\\nAnd do you not know, I said, that all mere opinions are bad, and the\\nbest of them blind? You would not deny that those who have any true\\nnotion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way\\nalong the road?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base, when\\nothers will tell you of brightness and beauty?\\n\\nStill, I must implore you, Socrates, said Glaucon, not to turn away\\njust as you are reaching the goal; if you will only give such an\\nexplanation of the good as you have already given of justice and\\ntemperance and the other virtues, we shall be satisfied.\\n\\nYes, my friend, and I shall be at least equally satisfied, but I cannot\\nhelp fearing that I shall fail, and that my indiscreet zeal will bring\\nridicule upon me. No, sweet sirs, let us not at present ask what is the\\nactual nature of the good, for to reach what is now in my thoughts\\nwould be an effort too great for me. But of the child of the good who\\nis likest him, I would fain speak, if I could be sure that you wished\\nto hear—otherwise, not.\\n\\nBy all means, he said, tell us about the child, and you shall remain in\\nour debt for the account of the parent.\\n\\nI do indeed wish, I replied, that I could pay, and you receive, the\\naccount of the parent, and not, as now, of the offspring only; take,\\nhowever, this latter by way of interest, and at the same time have a\\ncare that I do not render a false account, although I have no intention\\nof deceiving you.\\n\\nYes, we will take all the care that we can: proceed.\\n\\nYes, I said, but I must first come to an understanding with you, and\\nremind you of what I have mentioned in the course of this discussion,\\nand at many other times.\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nThe old story, that there is a many beautiful and a many good, and so\\nof other things which we describe and define; to all of them the term\\n‘many’ is applied.\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nAnd there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good, and of other\\nthings to which the term ‘many’ is applied there is an absolute; for\\nthey may be brought under a single idea, which is called the essence of\\neach.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nThe many, as we say, are seen but not known, and the ideas are known\\nbut not seen.\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nAnd what is the organ with which we see the visible things?\\n\\nThe sight, he said.\\n\\nAnd with the hearing, I said, we hear, and with the other senses\\nperceive the other objects of sense?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nBut have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex\\npiece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived?\\n\\nNo, I never have, he said.\\n\\nThen reflect; has the ear or voice need of any third or additional\\nnature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be\\nheard?\\n\\nNothing of the sort.\\n\\nNo, indeed, I replied; and the same is true of most, if not all, the\\nother senses—you would not say that any of them requires such an\\naddition?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nBut you see that without the addition of some other nature there is no\\nseeing or being seen?\\n\\nHow do you mean?\\n\\nSight being, as I conceive, in the eyes, and he who has eyes wanting to\\nsee; colour being also present in them, still unless there be a third\\nnature specially adapted to the purpose, the owner of the eyes will see\\nnothing and the colours will be invisible.\\n\\nOf what nature are you speaking?\\n\\nOf that which you term light, I replied.\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nNoble, then, is the bond which links together sight and visibility, and\\ngreat beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature; for light is\\ntheir bond, and light is no ignoble thing?\\n\\nNay, he said, the reverse of ignoble.\\n\\nAnd which, I said, of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord of\\nthis element? Whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly\\nand the visible to appear?\\n\\nYou mean the sun, as you and all mankind say.\\n\\nMay not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows?\\n\\nHow?\\n\\nNeither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nYet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the sun?\\n\\nBy far the most like.\\n\\nAnd the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is\\ndispensed from the sun?\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nThen the sun is not sight, but the author of sight who is recognised by\\nsight?\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nAnd this is he whom I call the child of the good, whom the good begat\\nin his own likeness, to be in the visible world, in relation to sight\\nand the things of sight, what the good is in the intellectual world in\\nrelation to mind and the things of mind:\\n\\nWill you be a little more explicit? he said.\\n\\nWhy, you know, I said, that the eyes, when a person directs them\\ntowards objects on which the light of day is no longer shining, but the\\nmoon and stars only, see dimly, and are nearly blind; they seem to have\\nno clearness of vision in them?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nBut when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines,\\nthey see clearly and there is sight in them?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd the soul is like the eye: when resting upon that on which truth and\\nbeing shine, the soul perceives and understands, and is radiant with\\nintelligence; but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and\\nperishing, then she has opinion only, and goes blinking about, and is\\nfirst of one opinion and then of another, and seems to have no\\nintelligence?\\n\\nJust so.\\n\\nNow, that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing to\\nthe knower is what I would have you term the idea of good, and this you\\nwill deem to be the cause of science, and of truth in so far as the\\nlatter becomes the subject of knowledge; beautiful too, as are both\\ntruth and knowledge, you will be right in esteeming this other nature\\nas more beautiful than either; and, as in the previous instance, light\\nand sight may be truly said to be like the sun, and yet not to be the\\nsun, so in this other sphere, science and truth may be deemed to be\\nlike the good, but not the good; the good has a place of honour yet\\nhigher.\\n\\nWhat a wonder of beauty that must be, he said, which is the author of\\nscience and truth, and yet surpasses them in beauty; for you surely\\ncannot mean to say that pleasure is the good?\\n\\nGod forbid, I replied; but may I ask you to consider the image in\\nanother point of view?\\n\\nIn what point of view?\\n\\nYou would say, would you not, that the sun is not only the author of\\nvisibility in all visible things, but of generation and nourishment and\\ngrowth, though he himself is not generation?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nIn like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of\\nknowledge to all things known, but of their being and essence, and yet\\nthe good is not essence, but far exceeds essence in dignity and power.\\n\\nGlaucon said, with a ludicrous earnestness: By the light of heaven, how\\namazing!\\n\\nYes, I said, and the exaggeration may be set down to you; for you made\\nme utter my fancies.\\n\\nAnd pray continue to utter them; at any rate let us hear if there is\\nanything more to be said about the similitude of the sun.\\n\\nYes, I said, there is a great deal more.\\n\\nThen omit nothing, however slight.\\n\\nI will do my best, I said; but I should think that a great deal will\\nhave to be omitted.\\n\\nI hope not, he said.\\n\\nYou have to imagine, then, that there are two ruling powers, and that\\none of them is set over the intellectual world, the other over the\\nvisible. I do not say heaven, lest you should fancy that I am playing\\nupon the name (‘ourhanoz, orhatoz’). May I suppose that you have this\\ndistinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?\\n\\nI have.\\n\\nNow take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts, and divide\\neach of them again in the same proportion, and suppose the two main\\ndivisions to answer, one to the visible and the other to the\\nintelligible, and then compare the subdivisions in respect of their\\nclearness and want of clearness, and you will find that the first\\nsection in the sphere of the visible consists of images. And by images\\nI mean, in the first place, shadows, and in the second place,\\nreflections in water and in solid, smooth and polished bodies and the\\nlike: Do you understand?\\n\\nYes, I understand.\\n\\nImagine, now, the other section, of which this is only the resemblance,\\nto include the animals which we see, and everything that grows or is\\nmade.\\n\\nVery good.\\n\\nWould you not admit that both the sections of this division have\\ndifferent degrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the\\nsphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge?\\n\\nMost undoubtedly.\\n\\nNext proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the\\nintellectual is to be divided.\\n\\nIn what manner?\\n\\nThus:—There are two subdivisions, in the lower of which the soul uses\\nthe figures given by the former division as images; the enquiry can\\nonly be hypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle\\ndescends to the other end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes\\nout of hypotheses, and goes up to a principle which is above\\nhypotheses, making no use of images as in the former case, but\\nproceeding only in and through the ideas themselves.\\n\\nI do not quite understand your meaning, he said.\\n\\nThen I will try again; you will understand me better when I have made\\nsome preliminary remarks. You are aware that students of geometry,\\narithmetic, and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and\\nthe figures and three kinds of angles and the like in their several\\nbranches of science; these are their hypotheses, which they and every\\nbody are supposed to know, and therefore they do not deign to give any\\naccount of them either to themselves or others; but they begin with\\nthem, and go on until they arrive at last, and in a consistent manner,\\nat their conclusion?\\n\\nYes, he said, I know.\\n\\nAnd do you not know also that although they make use of the visible\\nforms and reason about them, they are thinking not of these, but of the\\nideals which they resemble; not of the figures which they draw, but of\\nthe absolute square and the absolute diameter, and so on—the forms\\nwhich they draw or make, and which have shadows and reflections in\\nwater of their own, are converted by them into images, but they are\\nreally seeking to behold the things themselves, which can only be seen\\nwith the eye of the mind?\\n\\nThat is true.\\n\\nAnd of this kind I spoke as the intelligible, although in the search\\nafter it the soul is compelled to use hypotheses; not ascending to a\\nfirst principle, because she is unable to rise above the region of\\nhypothesis, but employing the objects of which the shadows below are\\nresemblances in their turn as images, they having in relation to the\\nshadows and reflections of them a greater distinctness, and therefore a\\nhigher value.\\n\\nI understand, he said, that you are speaking of the province of\\ngeometry and the sister arts.\\n\\nAnd when I speak of the other division of the intelligible, you will\\nunderstand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason\\nherself attains by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not as\\nfirst principles, but only as hypotheses—that is to say, as steps and\\npoints of departure into a world which is above hypotheses, in order\\nthat she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole; and\\nclinging to this and then to that which depends on this, by successive\\nsteps she descends again without the aid of any sensible object, from\\nideas, through ideas, and in ideas she ends.\\n\\nI understand you, he replied; not perfectly, for you seem to me to be\\ndescribing a task which is really tremendous; but, at any rate, I\\nunderstand you to say that knowledge and being, which the science of\\ndialectic contemplates, are clearer than the notions of the arts, as\\nthey are termed, which proceed from hypotheses only: these are also\\ncontemplated by the understanding, and not by the senses: yet, because\\nthey start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle, those who\\ncontemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher reason upon\\nthem, although when a first principle is added to them they are\\ncognizable by the higher reason. And the habit which is concerned with\\ngeometry and the cognate sciences I suppose that you would term\\nunderstanding and not reason, as being intermediate between opinion and\\nreason.\\n\\nYou have quite conceived my meaning, I said; and now, corresponding to\\nthese four divisions, let there be four faculties in the soul—reason\\nanswering to the highest, understanding to the second, faith (or\\nconviction) to the third, and perception of shadows to the last—and let\\nthere be a scale of them, and let us suppose that the several faculties\\nhave clearness in the same degree that their objects have truth.\\n\\nI understand, he replied, and give my assent, and accept your\\narrangement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n BOOK VII.\\n\\n\\nAnd now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is\\nenlightened or unenlightened:—Behold! human beings living in a\\nunderground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching\\nall along the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have\\ntheir legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see\\nbefore them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their\\nheads. Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, and\\nbetween the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will\\nsee, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which\\nmarionette players have in front of them, over which they show the\\npuppets.\\n\\nI see.\\n\\nAnd do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying all sorts\\nof vessels, and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone\\nand various materials, which appear over the wall? Some of them are\\ntalking, others silent.\\n\\nYou have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners.\\n\\nLike ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or the\\nshadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of\\nthe cave?\\n\\nTrue, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they were\\nnever allowed to move their heads?\\n\\nAnd of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would\\nonly see the shadows?\\n\\nYes, he said.\\n\\nAnd if they were able to converse with one another, would they not\\nsuppose that they were naming what was actually before them?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the\\nother side, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by\\nspoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow?\\n\\nNo question, he replied.\\n\\nTo them, I said, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows\\nof the images.\\n\\nThat is certain.\\n\\nAnd now look again, and see what will naturally follow if the prisoners\\nare released and disabused of their error. At first, when any of them\\nis liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round\\nand walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the\\nglare will distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities of\\nwhich in his former state he had seen the shadows; and then conceive\\nsome one saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but\\nthat now, when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned\\ntowards more real existence, he has a clearer vision,—what will be his\\nreply? And you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to\\nthe objects as they pass and requiring him to name them,—will he not be\\nperplexed? Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are\\ntruer than the objects which are now shown to him?\\n\\nFar truer.\\n\\nAnd if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have\\na pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the\\nobjects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in\\nreality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nAnd suppose once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and\\nrugged ascent, and held fast until he is forced into the presence of\\nthe sun himself, is he not likely to be pained and irritated? When he\\napproaches the light his eyes will be dazzled, and he will not be able\\nto see anything at all of what are now called realities.\\n\\nNot all in a moment, he said.\\n\\nHe will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world. And\\nfirst he will see the shadows best, next the reflections of men and\\nother objects in the water, and then the objects themselves; then he\\nwill gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled\\nheaven; and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the\\nsun or the light of the sun by day?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nLast of all he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections of\\nhim in the water, but he will see him in his own proper place, and not\\nin another; and he will contemplate him as he is.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nHe will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and\\nthe years, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world, and\\nin a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have\\nbeen accustomed to behold?\\n\\nClearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then reason about him.\\n\\nAnd when he remembered his old habitation, and the wisdom of the den\\nand his fellow-prisoners, do you not suppose that he would felicitate\\nhimself on the change, and pity them?\\n\\nCertainly, he would.\\n\\nAnd if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves on\\nthose who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark\\nwhich of them went before, and which followed after, and which were\\ntogether; and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to\\nthe future, do you think that he would care for such honours and\\nglories, or envy the possessors of them? Would he not say with Homer,\\n\\n‘Better to be the poor servant of a poor master,’\\n\\nand to endure anything, rather than think as they do and live after\\ntheir manner?\\n\\nYes, he said, I think that he would rather suffer anything than\\nentertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner.\\n\\nImagine once more, I said, such an one coming suddenly out of the sun\\nto be replaced in his old situation; would he not be certain to have\\nhis eyes full of darkness?\\n\\nTo be sure, he said.\\n\\nAnd if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the\\nshadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den, while\\nhis sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and\\nthe time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might\\nbe very considerable), would he not be ridiculous? Men would say of him\\nthat up he went and down he came without his eyes; and that it was\\nbetter not even to think of ascending; and if any one tried to loose\\nanother and lead him up to the light, let them only catch the offender,\\nand they would put him to death.\\n\\nNo question, he said.\\n\\nThis entire allegory, I said, you may now append, dear Glaucon, to the\\nprevious argument; the prison-house is the world of sight, the light of\\nthe fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret\\nthe journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual\\nworld according to my poor belief, which, at your desire, I have\\nexpressed—whether rightly or wrongly God knows. But, whether true or\\nfalse, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good\\nappears last of all, and is seen only with an effort; and, when seen,\\nis also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and\\nright, parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world,\\nand the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual; and\\nthat this is the power upon which he who would act rationally either in\\npublic or private life must have his eye fixed.\\n\\nI agree, he said, as far as I am able to understand you.\\n\\nMoreover, I said, you must not wonder that those who attain to this\\nbeatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs; for their\\nsouls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to\\ndwell; which desire of theirs is very natural, if our allegory may be\\ntrusted.\\n\\nYes, very natural.\\n\\nAnd is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine\\ncontemplations to the evil state of man, misbehaving himself in a\\nridiculous manner; if, while his eyes are blinking and before he has\\nbecome accustomed to the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight\\nin courts of law, or in other places, about the images or the shadows\\nof images of justice, and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of\\nthose who have never yet seen absolute justice?\\n\\nAnything but surprising, he replied.\\n\\nAny one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of\\nthe eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from\\ncoming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of\\nthe mind’s eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who\\nremembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak,\\nwill not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of\\nman has come out of the brighter life, and is unable to see because\\nunaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness to the day is\\ndazzled by excess of light. And he will count the one happy in his\\ncondition and state of being, and he will pity the other; or, if he\\nhave a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light,\\nthere will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him\\nwho returns from above out of the light into the den.\\n\\nThat, he said, is a very just distinction.\\n\\nBut then, if I am right, certain professors of education must be wrong\\nwhen they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not\\nthere before, like sight into blind eyes.\\n\\nThey undoubtedly say this, he replied.\\n\\nWhereas, our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning\\nexists in the soul already; and that just as the eye was unable to turn\\nfrom darkness to light without the whole body, so too the instrument of\\nknowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the\\nworld of becoming into that of being, and learn by degrees to endure\\nthe sight of being, and of the brightest and best of being, or in other\\nwords, of the good.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the\\neasiest and quickest manner; not implanting the faculty of sight, for\\nthat exists already, but has been turned in the wrong direction, and is\\nlooking away from the truth?\\n\\nYes, he said, such an art may be presumed.\\n\\nAnd whereas the other so-called virtues of the soul seem to be akin to\\nbodily qualities, for even when they are not originally innate they can\\nbe implanted later by habit and exercise, the virtue of wisdom more\\nthan anything else contains a divine element which always remains, and\\nby this conversion is rendered useful and profitable; or, on the other\\nhand, hurtful and useless. Did you never observe the narrow\\nintelligence flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue—how eager he\\nis, how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end; he is the\\nreverse of blind, but his keen eye-sight is forced into the service of\\nevil, and he is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness?\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nBut what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days\\nof their youth; and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures,\\nsuch as eating and drinking, which, like leaden weights, were attached\\nto them at their birth, and which drag them down and turn the vision of\\ntheir souls upon the things that are below—if, I say, they had been\\nreleased from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction,\\nthe very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as\\nthey see what their eyes are turned to now.\\n\\nVery likely.\\n\\nYes, I said; and there is another thing which is likely, or rather a\\nnecessary inference from what has preceded, that neither the uneducated\\nand uninformed of the truth, nor yet those who never make an end of\\ntheir education, will be able ministers of State; not the former,\\nbecause they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their\\nactions, private as well as public; nor the latter, because they will\\nnot act at all except upon compulsion, fancying that they are already\\ndwelling apart in the islands of the blest.\\n\\nVery true, he replied.\\n\\nThen, I said, the business of us who are the founders of the State will\\nbe to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have\\nalready shown to be the greatest of all—they must continue to ascend\\nuntil they arrive at the good; but when they have ascended and seen\\nenough we must not allow them to do as they do now.\\n\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nI mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be\\nallowed; they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the\\nden, and partake of their labours and honours, whether they are worth\\nhaving or not.\\n\\nBut is not this unjust? he said; ought we to give them a worse life,\\nwhen they might have a better?\\n\\nYou have again forgotten, my friend, I said, the intention of the\\nlegislator, who did not aim at making any one class in the State happy\\nabove the rest; the happiness was to be in the whole State, and he held\\nthe citizens together by persuasion and necessity, making them\\nbenefactors of the State, and therefore benefactors of one another; to\\nthis end he created them, not to please themselves, but to be his\\ninstruments in binding up the State.\\n\\nTrue, he said, I had forgotten.\\n\\nObserve, Glaucon, that there will be no injustice in compelling our\\nphilosophers to have a care and providence of others; we shall explain\\nto them that in other States, men of their class are not obliged to\\nshare in the toils of politics: and this is reasonable, for they grow\\nup at their own sweet will, and the government would rather not have\\nthem. Being self-taught, they cannot be expected to show any gratitude\\nfor a culture which they have never received. But we have brought you\\ninto the world to be rulers of the hive, kings of yourselves and of the\\nother citizens, and have educated you far better and more perfectly\\nthan they have been educated, and you are better able to share in the\\ndouble duty. Wherefore each of you, when his turn comes, must go down\\nto the general underground abode, and get the habit of seeing in the\\ndark. When you have acquired the habit, you will see ten thousand times\\nbetter than the inhabitants of the den, and you will know what the\\nseveral images are, and what they represent, because you have seen the\\nbeautiful and just and good in their truth. And thus our State, which\\nis also yours, will be a reality, and not a dream only, and will be\\nadministered in a spirit unlike that of other States, in which men\\nfight with one another about shadows only and are distracted in the\\nstruggle for power, which in their eyes is a great good. Whereas the\\ntruth is that the State in which the rulers are most reluctant to\\ngovern is always the best and most quietly governed, and the State in\\nwhich they are most eager, the worst.\\n\\nQuite true, he replied.\\n\\nAnd will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their turn at\\nthe toils of State, when they are allowed to spend the greater part of\\ntheir time with one another in the heavenly light?\\n\\nImpossible, he answered; for they are just men, and the commands which\\nwe impose upon them are just; there can be no doubt that every one of\\nthem will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the fashion\\nof our present rulers of State.\\n\\nYes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point. You must contrive for\\nyour future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler, and\\nthen you may have a well-ordered State; for only in the State which\\noffers this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver and gold,\\nbut in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of life. Whereas\\nif they go to the administration of public affairs, poor and hungering\\nafter their own private advantage, thinking that hence they are to\\nsnatch the chief good, order there can never be; for they will be\\nfighting about office, and the civil and domestic broils which thus\\narise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole State.\\n\\nMost true, he replied.\\n\\nAnd the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition\\nis that of true philosophy. Do you know of any other?\\n\\nIndeed, I do not, he said.\\n\\nAnd those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task? For, if they\\nare, there will be rival lovers, and they will fight.\\n\\nNo question.\\n\\nWho then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians? Surely they\\nwill be the men who are wisest about affairs of State, and by whom the\\nState is best administered, and who at the same time have other honours\\nand another and a better life than that of politics?\\n\\nThey are the men, and I will choose them, he replied.\\n\\nAnd now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced,\\nand how they are to be brought from darkness to light,—as some are said\\nto have ascended from the world below to the gods?\\n\\nBy all means, he replied.\\n\\nThe process, I said, is not the turning over of an oyster-shell (In\\nallusion to a game in which two parties fled or pursued according as an\\noyster-shell which was thrown into the air fell with the dark or light\\nside uppermost.), but the turning round of a soul passing from a day\\nwhich is little better than night to the true day of being, that is,\\nthe ascent from below, which we affirm to be true philosophy?\\n\\nQuite so.\\n\\nAnd should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of\\neffecting such a change?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nWhat sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming\\nto being? And another consideration has just occurred to me: You will\\nremember that our young men are to be warrior athletes?\\n\\nYes, that was said.\\n\\nThen this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?\\n\\nWhat quality?\\n\\nUsefulness in war.\\n\\nYes, if possible.\\n\\nThere were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?\\n\\nJust so.\\n\\nThere was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the\\nbody, and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and\\ncorruption?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThen that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nBut what do you say of music, which also entered to a certain extent\\ninto our former scheme?\\n\\nMusic, he said, as you will remember, was the counterpart of gymnastic,\\nand trained the guardians by the influences of habit, by harmony making\\nthem harmonious, by rhythm rhythmical, but not giving them science; and\\nthe words, whether fabulous or possibly true, had kindred elements of\\nrhythm and harmony in them. But in music there was nothing which tended\\nto that good which you are now seeking.\\n\\nYou are most accurate, I said, in your recollection; in music there\\ncertainly was nothing of the kind. But what branch of knowledge is\\nthere, my dear Glaucon, which is of the desired nature; since all the\\nuseful arts were reckoned mean by us?\\n\\nUndoubtedly; and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded, and the arts\\nare also excluded, what remains?\\n\\nWell, I said, there may be nothing left of our special subjects; and\\nthen we shall have to take something which is not special, but of\\nuniversal application.\\n\\nWhat may that be?\\n\\nA something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in\\ncommon, and which every one first has to learn among the elements of\\neducation.\\n\\nWhat is that?\\n\\nThe little matter of distinguishing one, two, and three—in a word,\\nnumber and calculation:—do not all arts and sciences necessarily\\npartake of them?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThen the art of war partakes of them?\\n\\nTo be sure.\\n\\nThen Palamedes, whenever he appears in tragedy, proves Agamemnon\\nridiculously unfit to be a general. Did you never remark how he\\ndeclares that he had invented number, and had numbered the ships and\\nset in array the ranks of the army at Troy; which implies that they had\\nnever been numbered before, and Agamemnon must be supposed literally to\\nhave been incapable of counting his own feet—how could he if he was\\nignorant of number? And if that is true, what sort of general must he\\nhave been?\\n\\nI should say a very strange one, if this was as you say.\\n\\nCan we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic?\\n\\nCertainly he should, if he is to have the smallest understanding of\\nmilitary tactics, or indeed, I should rather say, if he is to be a man\\nat all.\\n\\nI should like to know whether you have the same notion which I have of\\nthis study?\\n\\nWhat is your notion?\\n\\nIt appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking, and\\nwhich leads naturally to reflection, but never to have been rightly\\nused; for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being.\\n\\nWill you explain your meaning? he said.\\n\\nI will try, I said; and I wish you would share the enquiry with me, and\\nsay ‘yes’ or ‘no’ when I attempt to distinguish in my own mind what\\nbranches of knowledge have this attracting power, in order that we may\\nhave clearer proof that arithmetic is, as I suspect, one of them.\\n\\nExplain, he said.\\n\\nI mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds; some of them do\\nnot invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them;\\nwhile in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that\\nfurther enquiry is imperatively demanded.\\n\\nYou are clearly referring, he said, to the manner in which the senses\\nare imposed upon by distance, and by painting in light and shade.\\n\\nNo, I said, that is not at all my meaning.\\n\\nThen what is your meaning?\\n\\nWhen speaking of uninviting objects, I mean those which do not pass\\nfrom one sensation to the opposite; inviting objects are those which\\ndo; in this latter case the sense coming upon the object, whether at a\\ndistance or near, gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular\\nthan of its opposite. An illustration will make my meaning\\nclearer:—here are three fingers—a little finger, a second finger, and a\\nmiddle finger.\\n\\nVery good.\\n\\nYou may suppose that they are seen quite close: And here comes the\\npoint.\\n\\nWhat is it?\\n\\nEach of them equally appears a finger, whether seen in the middle or at\\nthe extremity, whether white or black, or thick or thin—it makes no\\ndifference; a finger is a finger all the same. In these cases a man is\\nnot compelled to ask of thought the question what is a finger? for the\\nsight never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd therefore, I said, as we might expect, there is nothing here which\\ninvites or excites intelligence.\\n\\nThere is not, he said.\\n\\nBut is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers?\\nCan sight adequately perceive them? and is no difference made by the\\ncircumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at\\nthe extremity? And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive\\nthe qualities of thickness or thinness, of softness or hardness? And so\\nof the other senses; do they give perfect intimations of such matters?\\nIs not their mode of operation on this wise—the sense which is\\nconcerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also\\nwith the quality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the\\nsame thing is felt to be both hard and soft?\\n\\nYou are quite right, he said.\\n\\nAnd must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense\\ngives of a hard which is also soft? What, again, is the meaning of\\nlight and heavy, if that which is light is also heavy, and that which\\nis heavy, light?\\n\\nYes, he said, these intimations which the soul receives are very\\ncurious and require to be explained.\\n\\nYes, I said, and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons to\\nher aid calculation and intelligence, that she may see whether the\\nseveral objects announced to her are one or two.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd if they turn out to be two, is not each of them one and different?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the two as in a\\nstate of division, for if there were undivided they could only be\\nconceived of as one?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThe eye certainly did see both small and great, but only in a confused\\nmanner; they were not distinguished.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nWhereas the thinking mind, intending to light up the chaos, was\\ncompelled to reverse the process, and look at small and great as\\nseparate and not confused.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nWas not this the beginning of the enquiry ‘What is great?’ and ‘What is\\nsmall?’\\n\\nExactly so.\\n\\nAnd thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible.\\n\\nMost true.\\n\\nThis was what I meant when I spoke of impressions which invited the\\nintellect, or the reverse—those which are simultaneous with opposite\\nimpressions, invite thought; those which are not simultaneous do not.\\n\\nI understand, he said, and agree with you.\\n\\nAnd to which class do unity and number belong?\\n\\nI do not know, he replied.\\n\\nThink a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply the\\nanswer; for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the sight\\nor by any other sense, then, as we were saying in the case of the\\nfinger, there would be nothing to attract towards being; but when there\\nis some contradiction always present, and one is the reverse of one and\\ninvolves the conception of plurality, then thought begins to be aroused\\nwithin us, and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision\\nasks ‘What is absolute unity?’ This is the way in which the study of\\nthe one has a power of drawing and converting the mind to the\\ncontemplation of true being.\\n\\nAnd surely, he said, this occurs notably in the case of one; for we see\\nthe same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude?\\n\\nYes, I said; and this being true of one must be equally true of all\\nnumber?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd they appear to lead the mind towards truth?\\n\\nYes, in a very remarkable manner.\\n\\nThen this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking, having a\\ndouble use, military and philosophical; for the man of war must learn\\nthe art of number or he will not know how to array his troops, and the\\nphilosopher also, because he has to rise out of the sea of change and\\nlay hold of true being, and therefore he must be an arithmetician.\\n\\nThat is true.\\n\\nAnd our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThen this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe;\\nand we must endeavour to persuade those who are to be the principal men\\nof our State to go and learn arithmetic, not as amateurs, but they must\\ncarry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind\\nonly; nor again, like merchants or retail-traders, with a view to\\nbuying or selling, but for the sake of their military use, and of the\\nsoul herself; and because this will be the easiest way for her to pass\\nfrom becoming to truth and being.\\n\\nThat is excellent, he said.\\n\\nYes, I said, and now having spoken of it, I must add how charming the\\nscience is! and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end, if\\npursued in the spirit of a philosopher, and not of a shopkeeper!\\n\\nHow do you mean?\\n\\nI mean, as I was saying, that arithmetic has a very great and elevating\\neffect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and\\nrebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into\\nthe argument. You know how steadily the masters of the art repel and\\nridicule any one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is\\ncalculating, and if you divide, they multiply (Meaning either (1) that\\nthey integrate the number because they deny the possibility of\\nfractions; or (2) that division is regarded by them as a process of\\nmultiplication, for the fractions of one continue to be units.), taking\\ncare that one shall continue one and not become lost in fractions.\\n\\nThat is very true.\\n\\nNow, suppose a person were to say to them: O my friends, what are these\\nwonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as you say,\\nthere is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal,\\ninvariable, indivisible,—what would they answer?\\n\\nThey would answer, as I should conceive, that they were speaking of\\nthose numbers which can only be realized in thought.\\n\\nThen you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary,\\nnecessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in\\nthe attainment of pure truth?\\n\\nYes; that is a marked characteristic of it.\\n\\nAnd have you further observed, that those who have a natural talent for\\ncalculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge; and\\neven the dull, if they have had an arithmetical training, although they\\nmay derive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker than\\nthey would otherwise have been.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nAnd indeed, you will not easily find a more difficult study, and not\\nmany as difficult.\\n\\nYou will not.\\n\\nAnd, for all these reasons, arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which\\nthe best natures should be trained, and which must not be given up.\\n\\nI agree.\\n\\nLet this then be made one of our subjects of education. And next, shall\\nwe enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us?\\n\\nYou mean geometry?\\n\\nExactly so.\\n\\nClearly, he said, we are concerned with that part of geometry which\\nrelates to war; for in pitching a camp, or taking up a position, or\\nclosing or extending the lines of an army, or any other military\\nmanoeuvre, whether in actual battle or on a march, it will make all the\\ndifference whether a general is or is not a geometrician.\\n\\nYes, I said, but for that purpose a very little of either geometry or\\ncalculation will be enough; the question relates rather to the greater\\nand more advanced part of geometry—whether that tends in any degree to\\nmake more easy the vision of the idea of good; and thither, as I was\\nsaying, all things tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze towards\\nthat place, where is the full perfection of being, which she ought, by\\nall means, to behold.\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nThen if geometry compels us to view being, it concerns us; if becoming\\nonly, it does not concern us?\\n\\nYes, that is what we assert.\\n\\nYet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not deny\\nthat such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the\\nordinary language of geometricians.\\n\\nHow so?\\n\\nThey have in view practice only, and are always speaking, in a narrow\\nand ridiculous manner, of squaring and extending and applying and the\\nlike—they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life;\\nwhereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science.\\n\\nCertainly, he said.\\n\\nThen must not a further admission be made?\\n\\nWhat admission?\\n\\nThat the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal,\\nand not of aught perishing and transient.\\n\\nThat, he replied, may be readily allowed, and is true.\\n\\nThen, my noble friend, geometry will draw the soul towards truth, and\\ncreate the spirit of philosophy, and raise up that which is now\\nunhappily allowed to fall down.\\n\\nNothing will be more likely to have such an effect.\\n\\nThen nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants\\nof your fair city should by all means learn geometry. Moreover the\\nscience has indirect effects, which are not small.\\n\\nOf what kind? he said.\\n\\nThere are the military advantages of which you spoke, I said; and in\\nall departments of knowledge, as experience proves, any one who has\\nstudied geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has\\nnot.\\n\\nYes indeed, he said, there is an infinite difference between them.\\n\\nThen shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our\\nyouth will study?\\n\\nLet us do so, he replied.\\n\\nAnd suppose we make astronomy the third—what do you say?\\n\\nI am strongly inclined to it, he said; the observation of the seasons\\nand of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the\\nfarmer or sailor.\\n\\nI am amused, I said, at your fear of the world, which makes you guard\\nagainst the appearance of insisting upon useless studies; and I quite\\nadmit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye of\\nthe soul which, when by other pursuits lost and dimmed, is by these\\npurified and re-illumined; and is more precious far than ten thousand\\nbodily eyes, for by it alone is truth seen. Now there are two classes\\nof persons: one class of those who will agree with you and will take\\nyour words as a revelation; another class to whom they will be utterly\\nunmeaning, and who will naturally deem them to be idle tales, for they\\nsee no sort of profit which is to be obtained from them. And therefore\\nyou had better decide at once with which of the two you are proposing\\nto argue. You will very likely say with neither, and that your chief\\naim in carrying on the argument is your own improvement; at the same\\ntime you do not grudge to others any benefit which they may receive.\\n\\nI think that I should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my own\\nbehalf.\\n\\nThen take a step backward, for we have gone wrong in the order of the\\nsciences.\\n\\nWhat was the mistake? he said.\\n\\nAfter plane geometry, I said, we proceeded at once to solids in\\nrevolution, instead of taking solids in themselves; whereas after the\\nsecond dimension the third, which is concerned with cubes and\\ndimensions of depth, ought to have followed.\\n\\nThat is true, Socrates; but so little seems to be known as yet about\\nthese subjects.\\n\\nWhy, yes, I said, and for two reasons:—in the first place, no\\ngovernment patronises them; this leads to a want of energy in the\\npursuit of them, and they are difficult; in the second place, students\\ncannot learn them unless they have a director. But then a director can\\nhardly be found, and even if he could, as matters now stand, the\\nstudents, who are very conceited, would not attend to him. That,\\nhowever, would be otherwise if the whole State became the director of\\nthese studies and gave honour to them; then disciples would want to\\ncome, and there would be continuous and earnest search, and discoveries\\nwould be made; since even now, disregarded as they are by the world,\\nand maimed of their fair proportions, and although none of their\\nvotaries can tell the use of them, still these studies force their way\\nby their natural charm, and very likely, if they had the help of the\\nState, they would some day emerge into light.\\n\\nYes, he said, there is a remarkable charm in them. But I do not clearly\\nunderstand the change in the order. First you began with a geometry of\\nplane surfaces?\\n\\nYes, I said.\\n\\nAnd you placed astronomy next, and then you made a step backward?\\n\\nYes, and I have delayed you by my hurry; the ludicrous state of solid\\ngeometry, which, in natural order, should have followed, made me pass\\nover this branch and go on to astronomy, or motion of solids.\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nThen assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence if\\nencouraged by the State, let us go on to astronomy, which will be\\nfourth.\\n\\nThe right order, he replied. And now, Socrates, as you rebuked the\\nvulgar manner in which I praised astronomy before, my praise shall be\\ngiven in your own spirit. For every one, as I think, must see that\\nastronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world\\nto another.\\n\\nEvery one but myself, I said; to every one else this may be clear, but\\nnot to me.\\n\\nAnd what then would you say?\\n\\nI should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy\\nappear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards.\\n\\nWhat do you mean? he asked.\\n\\nYou, I replied, have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our\\nknowledge of the things above. And I dare say that if a person were to\\nthrow his head back and study the fretted ceiling, you would still\\nthink that his mind was the percipient, and not his eyes. And you are\\nvery likely right, and I may be a simpleton: but, in my opinion, that\\nknowledge only which is of being and of the unseen can make the soul\\nlook upwards, and whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks on the\\nground, seeking to learn some particular of sense, I would deny that he\\ncan learn, for nothing of that sort is matter of science; his soul is\\nlooking downwards, not upwards, whether his way to knowledge is by\\nwater or by land, whether he floats, or only lies on his back.\\n\\nI acknowledge, he said, the justice of your rebuke. Still, I should\\nlike to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more\\nconducive to that knowledge of which we are speaking?\\n\\nI will tell you, I said: The starry heaven which we behold is wrought\\nupon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most\\nperfect of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far to\\nthe true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are\\nrelative to each other, and carry with them that which is contained in\\nthem, in the true number and in every true figure. Now, these are to be\\napprehended by reason and intelligence, but not by sight.\\n\\nTrue, he replied.\\n\\nThe spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to\\nthat higher knowledge; their beauty is like the beauty of figures or\\npictures excellently wrought by the hand of Daedalus, or some other\\ngreat artist, which we may chance to behold; any geometrician who saw\\nthem would appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship, but he\\nwould never dream of thinking that in them he could find the true equal\\nor the true double, or the truth of any other proportion.\\n\\nNo, he replied, such an idea would be ridiculous.\\n\\nAnd will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at\\nthe movements of the stars? Will he not think that heaven and the\\nthings in heaven are framed by the Creator of them in the most perfect\\nmanner? But he will never imagine that the proportions of night and\\nday, or of both to the month, or of the month to the year, or of the\\nstars to these and to one another, and any other things that are\\nmaterial and visible can also be eternal and subject to no\\ndeviation—that would be absurd; and it is equally absurd to take so\\nmuch pains in investigating their exact truth.\\n\\nI quite agree, though I never thought of this before.\\n\\nThen, I said, in astronomy, as in geometry, we should employ problems,\\nand let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right\\nway and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real use.\\n\\nThat, he said, is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers.\\n\\nYes, I said; and there are many other things which must also have a\\nsimilar extension given to them, if our legislation is to be of any\\nvalue. But can you tell me of any other suitable study?\\n\\nNo, he said, not without thinking.\\n\\nMotion, I said, has many forms, and not one only; two of them are\\nobvious enough even to wits no better than ours; and there are others,\\nas I imagine, which may be left to wiser persons.\\n\\nBut where are the two?\\n\\nThere is a second, I said, which is the counterpart of the one already\\nnamed.\\n\\nAnd what may that be?\\n\\nThe second, I said, would seem relatively to the ears to be what the\\nfirst is to the eyes; for I conceive that as the eyes are designed to\\nlook up at the stars, so are the ears to hear harmonious motions; and\\nthese are sister sciences—as the Pythagoreans say, and we, Glaucon,\\nagree with them?\\n\\nYes, he replied.\\n\\nBut this, I said, is a laborious study, and therefore we had better go\\nand learn of them; and they will tell us whether there are any other\\napplications of these sciences. At the same time, we must not lose\\nsight of our own higher object.\\n\\nWhat is that?\\n\\nThere is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach, and which our\\npupils ought also to attain, and not to fall short of, as I was saying\\nthat they did in astronomy. For in the science of harmony, as you\\nprobably know, the same thing happens. The teachers of harmony compare\\nthe sounds and consonances which are heard only, and their labour, like\\nthat of the astronomers, is in vain.\\n\\nYes, by heaven! he said; and ’tis as good as a play to hear them\\ntalking about their condensed notes, as they call them; they put their\\nears close alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from\\ntheir neighbour’s wall—one set of them declaring that they distinguish\\nan intermediate note and have found the least interval which should be\\nthe unit of measurement; the others insisting that the two sounds have\\npassed into the same—either party setting their ears before their\\nunderstanding.\\n\\nYou mean, I said, those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and\\nrack them on the pegs of the instrument: I might carry on the metaphor\\nand speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives, and\\nmake accusations against the strings, both of backwardness and\\nforwardness to sound; but this would be tedious, and therefore I will\\nonly say that these are not the men, and that I am referring to the\\nPythagoreans, of whom I was just now proposing to enquire about\\nharmony. For they too are in error, like the astronomers; they\\ninvestigate the numbers of the harmonies which are heard, but they\\nnever attain to problems—that is to say, they never reach the natural\\nharmonies of number, or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and\\nothers not.\\n\\nThat, he said, is a thing of more than mortal knowledge.\\n\\nA thing, I replied, which I would rather call useful; that is, if\\nsought after with a view to the beautiful and good; but if pursued in\\nany other spirit, useless.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nNow, when all these studies reach the point of inter-communion and\\nconnection with one another, and come to be considered in their mutual\\naffinities, then, I think, but not till then, will the pursuit of them\\nhave a value for our objects; otherwise there is no profit in them.\\n\\nI suspect so; but you are speaking, Socrates, of a vast work.\\n\\nWhat do you mean? I said; the prelude or what? Do you not know that all\\nthis is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn?\\nFor you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a\\ndialectician?\\n\\nAssuredly not, he said; I have hardly ever known a mathematician who\\nwas capable of reasoning.\\n\\nBut do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason\\nwill have the knowledge which we require of them?\\n\\nNeither can this be supposed.\\n\\nAnd so, Glaucon, I said, we have at last arrived at the hymn of\\ndialectic. This is that strain which is of the intellect only, but\\nwhich the faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate; for\\nsight, as you may remember, was imagined by us after a while to behold\\nthe real animals and stars, and last of all the sun himself. And so\\nwith dialectic; when a person starts on the discovery of the absolute\\nby the light of reason only, and without any assistance of sense, and\\nperseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives at the perception of\\nthe absolute good, he at last finds himself at the end of the\\nintellectual world, as in the case of sight at the end of the visible.\\n\\nExactly, he said.\\n\\nThen this is the progress which you call dialectic?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nBut the release of the prisoners from chains, and their translation\\nfrom the shadows to the images and to the light, and the ascent from\\nthe underground den to the sun, while in his presence they are vainly\\ntrying to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun, but are\\nable to perceive even with their weak eyes the images in the water\\n(which are divine), and are the shadows of true existence (not shadows\\nof images cast by a light of fire, which compared with the sun is only\\nan image)—this power of elevating the highest principle in the soul to\\nthe contemplation of that which is best in existence, with which we may\\ncompare the raising of that faculty which is the very light of the body\\nto the sight of that which is brightest in the material and visible\\nworld—this power is given, as I was saying, by all that study and\\npursuit of the arts which has been described.\\n\\nI agree in what you are saying, he replied, which may be hard to\\nbelieve, yet, from another point of view, is harder still to deny.\\nThis, however, is not a theme to be treated of in passing only, but\\nwill have to be discussed again and again. And so, whether our\\nconclusion be true or false, let us assume all this, and proceed at\\nonce from the prelude or preamble to the chief strain (A play upon the\\nGreek word, which means both ‘law’ and ‘strain.’), and describe that in\\nlike manner. Say, then, what is the nature and what are the divisions\\nof dialectic, and what are the paths which lead thither; for these\\npaths will also lead to our final rest.\\n\\nDear Glaucon, I said, you will not be able to follow me here, though I\\nwould do my best, and you should behold not an image only but the\\nabsolute truth, according to my notion. Whether what I told you would\\nor would not have been a reality I cannot venture to say; but you would\\nhave seen something like reality; of that I am confident.\\n\\nDoubtless, he replied.\\n\\nBut I must also remind you, that the power of dialectic alone can\\nreveal this, and only to one who is a disciple of the previous\\nsciences.\\n\\nOf that assertion you may be as confident as of the last.\\n\\nAnd assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of\\ncomprehending by any regular process all true existence or of\\nascertaining what each thing is in its own nature; for the arts in\\ngeneral are concerned with the desires or opinions of men, or are\\ncultivated with a view to production and construction, or for the\\npreservation of such productions and constructions; and as to the\\nmathematical sciences which, as we were saying, have some apprehension\\nof true being—geometry and the like—they only dream about being, but\\nnever can they behold the waking reality so long as they leave the\\nhypotheses which they use unexamined, and are unable to give an account\\nof them. For when a man knows not his own first principle, and when the\\nconclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows\\nnot what, how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever\\nbecome science?\\n\\nImpossible, he said.\\n\\nThen dialectic, and dialectic alone, goes directly to the first\\nprinciple and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in\\norder to make her ground secure; the eye of the soul, which is\\nliterally buried in an outlandish slough, is by her gentle aid lifted\\nupwards; and she uses as handmaids and helpers in the work of\\nconversion, the sciences which we have been discussing. Custom terms\\nthem sciences, but they ought to have some other name, implying greater\\nclearness than opinion and less clearness than science: and this, in\\nour previous sketch, was called understanding. But why should we\\ndispute about names when we have realities of such importance to\\nconsider?\\n\\nWhy indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought\\nof the mind with clearness?\\n\\nAt any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions; two\\nfor intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division\\nscience, the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth\\nperception of shadows, opinion being concerned with becoming, and\\nintellect with being; and so to make a proportion:—\\n\\nAs being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion. And as\\nintellect is to opinion, so is science to belief, and understanding to\\nthe perception of shadows.\\n\\nBut let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the\\nsubjects of opinion and of intellect, for it will be a long enquiry,\\nmany times longer than this has been.\\n\\nAs far as I understand, he said, I agree.\\n\\nAnd do you also agree, I said, in describing the dialectician as one\\nwho attains a conception of the essence of each thing? And he who does\\nnot possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in\\nwhatever degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in\\nintelligence? Will you admit so much?\\n\\nYes, he said; how can I deny it?\\n\\nAnd you would say the same of the conception of the good? Until the\\nperson is able to abstract and define rationally the idea of good, and\\nunless he can run the gauntlet of all objections, and is ready to\\ndisprove them, not by appeals to opinion, but to absolute truth, never\\nfaltering at any step of the argument—unless he can do all this, you\\nwould say that he knows neither the idea of good nor any other good; he\\napprehends only a shadow, if anything at all, which is given by opinion\\nand not by science;—dreaming and slumbering in this life, before he is\\nwell awake here, he arrives at the world below, and has his final\\nquietus.\\n\\nIn all that I should most certainly agree with you.\\n\\nAnd surely you would not have the children of your ideal State, whom\\nyou are nurturing and educating—if the ideal ever becomes a reality—you\\nwould not allow the future rulers to be like posts (Literally ‘lines,’\\nprobably the starting-point of a race-course.), having no reason in\\nthem, and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nThen you will make a law that they shall have such an education as will\\nenable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering\\nquestions?\\n\\nYes, he said, you and I together will make it.\\n\\nDialectic, then, as you will agree, is the coping-stone of the\\nsciences, and is set over them; no other science can be placed\\nhigher—the nature of knowledge can no further go?\\n\\nI agree, he said.\\n\\nBut to whom we are to assign these studies, and in what way they are to\\nbe assigned, are questions which remain to be considered.\\n\\nYes, clearly.\\n\\nYou remember, I said, how the rulers were chosen before?\\n\\nCertainly, he said.\\n\\nThe same natures must still be chosen, and the preference again given\\nto the surest and the bravest, and, if possible, to the fairest; and,\\nhaving noble and generous tempers, they should also have the natural\\ngifts which will facilitate their education.\\n\\nAnd what are these?\\n\\nSuch gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition; for the mind\\nmore often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of\\ngymnastics: the toil is more entirely the mind’s own, and is not shared\\nwith the body.\\n\\nVery true, he replied.\\n\\nFurther, he of whom we are in search should have a good memory, and be\\nan unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line; or he will\\nnever be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go\\nthrough all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of\\nhim.\\n\\nCertainly, he said; he must have natural gifts.\\n\\nThe mistake at present is, that those who study philosophy have no\\nvocation, and this, as I was before saying, is the reason why she has\\nfallen into disrepute: her true sons should take her by the hand and\\nnot bastards.\\n\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nIn the first place, her votary should not have a lame or halting\\nindustry—I mean, that he should not be half industrious and half idle:\\nas, for example, when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting, and\\nall other bodily exercises, but a hater rather than a lover of the\\nlabour of learning or listening or enquiring. Or the occupation to\\nwhich he devotes himself may be of an opposite kind, and he may have\\nthe other sort of lameness.\\n\\nCertainly, he said.\\n\\nAnd as to truth, I said, is not a soul equally to be deemed halt and\\nlame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at\\nherself and others when they tell lies, but is patient of involuntary\\nfalsehood, and does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire\\nof ignorance, and has no shame at being detected?\\n\\nTo be sure.\\n\\nAnd, again, in respect of temperance, courage, magnificence, and every\\nother virtue, should we not carefully distinguish between the true son\\nand the bastard? for where there is no discernment of such qualities\\nstates and individuals unconsciously err; and the state makes a ruler,\\nand the individual a friend, of one who, being defective in some part\\nof virtue, is in a figure lame or a bastard.\\n\\nThat is very true, he said.\\n\\nAll these things, then, will have to be carefully considered by us; and\\nif only those whom we introduce to this vast system of education and\\ntraining are sound in body and mind, justice herself will have nothing\\nto say against us, and we shall be the saviours of the constitution and\\nof the State; but, if our pupils are men of another stamp, the reverse\\nwill happen, and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule on\\nphilosophy than she has to endure at present.\\n\\nThat would not be creditable.\\n\\nCertainly not, I said; and yet perhaps, in thus turning jest into\\nearnest I am equally ridiculous.\\n\\nIn what respect?\\n\\nI had forgotten, I said, that we were not serious, and spoke with too\\nmuch excitement. For when I saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled\\nunder foot of men I could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the\\nauthors of her disgrace: and my anger made me too vehement.\\n\\nIndeed! I was listening, and did not think so.\\n\\nBut I, who am the speaker, felt that I was. And now let me remind you\\nthat, although in our former selection we chose old men, we must not do\\nso in this. Solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he\\ngrows old may learn many things—for he can no more learn much than he\\ncan run much; youth is the time for any extraordinary toil.\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nAnd, therefore, calculation and geometry and all the other elements of\\ninstruction, which are a preparation for dialectic, should be presented\\nto the mind in childhood; not, however, under any notion of forcing our\\nsystem of education.\\n\\nWhy not?\\n\\nBecause a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of\\nknowledge of any kind. Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm\\nto the body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains\\nno hold on the mind.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nThen, my good friend, I said, do not use compulsion, but let early\\neducation be a sort of amusement; you will then be better able to find\\nout the natural bent.\\n\\nThat is a very rational notion, he said.\\n\\nDo you remember that the children, too, were to be taken to see the\\nbattle on horseback; and that if there were no danger they were to be\\nbrought close up and, like young hounds, have a taste of blood given\\nthem?\\n\\nYes, I remember.\\n\\nThe same practice may be followed, I said, in all these things—labours,\\nlessons, dangers—and he who is most at home in all of them ought to be\\nenrolled in a select number.\\n\\nAt what age?\\n\\nAt the age when the necessary gymnastics are over: the period whether\\nof two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless\\nfor any other purpose; for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to\\nlearning; and the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one\\nof the most important tests to which our youth are subjected.\\n\\nCertainly, he replied.\\n\\nAfter that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years\\nold will be promoted to higher honour, and the sciences which they\\nlearned without any order in their early education will now be brought\\ntogether, and they will be able to see the natural relationship of them\\nto one another and to true being.\\n\\nYes, he said, that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting\\nroot.\\n\\nYes, I said; and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion\\nof dialectical talent: the comprehensive mind is always the\\ndialectical.\\n\\nI agree with you, he said.\\n\\nThese, I said, are the points which you must consider; and those who\\nhave most of this comprehension, and who are most steadfast in their\\nlearning, and in their military and other appointed duties, when they\\nhave arrived at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of the\\nselect class, and elevated to higher honour; and you will have to prove\\nthem by the help of dialectic, in order to learn which of them is able\\nto give up the use of sight and the other senses, and in company with\\ntruth to attain absolute being: And here, my friend, great caution is\\nrequired.\\n\\nWhy great caution?\\n\\nDo you not remark, I said, how great is the evil which dialectic has\\nintroduced?\\n\\nWhat evil? he said.\\n\\nThe students of the art are filled with lawlessness.\\n\\nQuite true, he said.\\n\\nDo you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in\\ntheir case? or will you make allowance for them?\\n\\nIn what way make allowance?\\n\\nI want you, I said, by way of parallel, to imagine a supposititious son\\nwho is brought up in great wealth; he is one of a great and numerous\\nfamily, and has many flatterers. When he grows up to manhood, he learns\\nthat his alleged are not his real parents; but who the real are he is\\nunable to discover. Can you guess how he will be likely to behave\\ntowards his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during\\nthe period when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again\\nwhen he knows? Or shall I guess for you?\\n\\nIf you please.\\n\\nThen I should say, that while he is ignorant of the truth he will be\\nlikely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations\\nmore than the flatterers; he will be less inclined to neglect them when\\nin need, or to do or say anything against them; and he will be less\\nwilling to disobey them in any important matter.\\n\\nHe will.\\n\\nBut when he has made the discovery, I should imagine that he would\\ndiminish his honour and regard for them, and would become more devoted\\nto the flatterers; their influence over him would greatly increase; he\\nwould now live after their ways, and openly associate with them, and,\\nunless he were of an unusually good disposition, he would trouble\\nhimself no more about his supposed parents or other relations.\\n\\nWell, all that is very probable. But how is the image applicable to the\\ndisciples of philosophy?\\n\\nIn this way: you know that there are certain principles about justice\\nand honour, which were taught us in childhood, and under their parental\\nauthority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring them.\\n\\nThat is true.\\n\\nThere are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter and\\nattract the soul, but do not influence those of us who have any sense\\nof right, and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their\\nfathers.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nNow, when a man is in this state, and the questioning spirit asks what\\nis fair or honourable, and he answers as the legislator has taught him,\\nand then arguments many and diverse refute his words, until he is\\ndriven into believing that nothing is honourable any more than\\ndishonourable, or just and good any more than the reverse, and so of\\nall the notions which he most valued, do you think that he will still\\nhonour and obey them as before?\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nAnd when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore,\\nand he fails to discover the true, can he be expected to pursue any\\nlife other than that which flatters his desires?\\n\\nHe cannot.\\n\\nAnd from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of\\nit?\\n\\nUnquestionably.\\n\\nNow all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as I have\\ndescribed, and also, as I was just now saying, most excusable.\\n\\nYes, he said; and, I may add, pitiable.\\n\\nTherefore, that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our\\ncitizens who are now thirty years of age, every care must be taken in\\nintroducing them to dialectic.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThere is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early;\\nfor youngsters, as you may have observed, when they first get the taste\\nin their mouths, argue for amusement, and are always contradicting and\\nrefuting others in imitation of those who refute them; like puppy-dogs,\\nthey rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near them.\\n\\nYes, he said, there is nothing which they like better.\\n\\nAnd when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the\\nhands of many, they violently and speedily get into a way of not\\nbelieving anything which they believed before, and hence, not only\\nthey, but philosophy and all that relates to it is apt to have a bad\\nname with the rest of the world.\\n\\nToo true, he said.\\n\\nBut when a man begins to get older, he will no longer be guilty of such\\ninsanity; he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth,\\nand not the eristic, who is contradicting for the sake of amusement;\\nand the greater moderation of his character will increase instead of\\ndiminishing the honour of the pursuit.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nAnd did we not make special provision for this, when we said that the\\ndisciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast, not, as now,\\nany chance aspirant or intruder?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nSuppose, I said, the study of philosophy to take the place of\\ngymnastics and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively\\nfor twice the number of years which were passed in bodily exercise—will\\nthat be enough?\\n\\nWould you say six or four years? he asked.\\n\\nSay five years, I replied; at the end of the time they must be sent\\ndown again into the den and compelled to hold any military or other\\noffice which young men are qualified to hold: in this way they will get\\ntheir experience of life, and there will be an opportunity of trying\\nwhether, when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation, they\\nwill stand firm or flinch.\\n\\nAnd how long is this stage of their lives to last?\\n\\nFifteen years, I answered; and when they have reached fifty years of\\nage, then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves\\nin every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at\\nlast to their consummation: the time has now arrived at which they must\\nraise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all\\nthings, and behold the absolute good; for that is the pattern according\\nto which they are to order the State and the lives of individuals, and\\nthe remainder of their own lives also; making philosophy their chief\\npursuit, but, when their turn comes, toiling also at politics and\\nruling for the public good, not as though they were performing some\\nheroic action, but simply as a matter of duty; and when they have\\nbrought up in each generation others like themselves and left them in\\ntheir place to be governors of the State, then they will depart to the\\nIslands of the Blest and dwell there; and the city will give them\\npublic memorials and sacrifices and honour them, if the Pythian oracle\\nconsent, as demigods, but if not, as in any case blessed and divine.\\n\\nYou are a sculptor, Socrates, and have made statues of our governors\\nfaultless in beauty.\\n\\nYes, I said, Glaucon, and of our governesses too; for you must not\\nsuppose that what I have been saying applies to men only and not to\\nwomen as far as their natures can go.\\n\\nThere you are right, he said, since we have made them to share in all\\nthings like the men.\\n\\nWell, I said, and you would agree (would you not?) that what has been\\nsaid about the State and the government is not a mere dream, and\\nalthough difficult not impossible, but only possible in the way which\\nhas been supposed; that is to say, when the true philosopher kings are\\nborn in a State, one or more of them, despising the honours of this\\npresent world which they deem mean and worthless, esteeming above all\\nthings right and the honour that springs from right, and regarding\\njustice as the greatest and most necessary of all things, whose\\nministers they are, and whose principles will be exalted by them when\\nthey set in order their own city?\\n\\nHow will they proceed?\\n\\nThey will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants of\\nthe city who are more than ten years old, and will take possession of\\ntheir children, who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents;\\nthese they will train in their own habits and laws, I mean in the laws\\nwhich we have given them: and in this way the State and constitution of\\nwhich we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness,\\nand the nation which has such a constitution will gain most.\\n\\nYes, that will be the best way. And I think, Socrates, that you have\\nvery well described how, if ever, such a constitution might come into\\nbeing.\\n\\nEnough then of the perfect State, and of the man who bears its\\nimage—there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him.\\n\\nThere is no difficulty, he replied; and I agree with you in thinking\\nthat nothing more need be said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n BOOK VIII.\\n\\n\\nAnd so, Glaucon, we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect\\nState wives and children are to be in common; and that all education\\nand the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common, and the best\\nphilosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings?\\n\\nThat, replied Glaucon, has been acknowledged.\\n\\nYes, I said; and we have further acknowledged that the governors, when\\nappointed themselves, will take their soldiers and place them in houses\\nsuch as we were describing, which are common to all, and contain\\nnothing private, or individual; and about their property, you remember\\nwhat we agreed?\\n\\nYes, I remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions\\nof mankind; they were to be warrior athletes and guardians, receiving\\nfrom the other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only their\\nmaintenance, and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole\\nState.\\n\\nTrue, I said; and now that this division of our task is concluded, let\\nus find the point at which we digressed, that we may return into the\\nold path.\\n\\nThere is no difficulty in returning; you implied, then as now, that you\\nhad finished the description of the State: you said that such a State\\nwas good, and that the man was good who answered to it, although, as\\nnow appears, you had more excellent things to relate both of State and\\nman. And you said further, that if this was the true form, then the\\nothers were false; and of the false forms, you said, as I remember,\\nthat there were four principal ones, and that their defects, and the\\ndefects of the individuals corresponding to them, were worth examining.\\nWhen we had seen all the individuals, and finally agreed as to who was\\nthe best and who was the worst of them, we were to consider whether the\\nbest was not also the happiest, and the worst the most miserable. I\\nasked you what were the four forms of government of which you spoke,\\nand then Polemarchus and Adeimantus put in their word; and you began\\nagain, and have found your way to the point at which we have now\\narrived.\\n\\nYour recollection, I said, is most exact.\\n\\nThen, like a wrestler, he replied, you must put yourself again in the\\nsame position; and let me ask the same questions, and do you give me\\nthe same answer which you were about to give me then.\\n\\nYes, if I can, I will, I said.\\n\\nI shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions of\\nwhich you were speaking.\\n\\nThat question, I said, is easily answered: the four governments of\\nwhich I spoke, so far as they have distinct names, are, first, those of\\nCrete and Sparta, which are generally applauded; what is termed\\noligarchy comes next; this is not equally approved, and is a form of\\ngovernment which teems with evils: thirdly, democracy, which naturally\\nfollows oligarchy, although very different: and lastly comes tyranny,\\ngreat and famous, which differs from them all, and is the fourth and\\nworst disorder of a State. I do not know, do you? of any other\\nconstitution which can be said to have a distinct character. There are\\nlordships and principalities which are bought and sold, and some other\\nintermediate forms of government. But these are nondescripts and may be\\nfound equally among Hellenes and among barbarians.\\n\\nYes, he replied, we certainly hear of many curious forms of government\\nwhich exist among them.\\n\\nDo you know, I said, that governments vary as the dispositions of men\\nvary, and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the\\nother? For we cannot suppose that States are made of ‘oak and rock,’\\nand not out of the human natures which are in them, and which in a\\nfigure turn the scale and draw other things after them?\\n\\nYes, he said, the States are as the men are; they grow out of human\\ncharacters.\\n\\nThen if the constitutions of States are five, the dispositions of\\nindividual minds will also be five?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nHim who answers to aristocracy, and whom we rightly call just and good,\\nwe have already described.\\n\\nWe have.\\n\\nThen let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures, being\\nthe contentious and ambitious, who answer to the Spartan polity; also\\nthe oligarchical, democratical, and tyrannical. Let us place the most\\njust by the side of the most unjust, and when we see them we shall be\\nable to compare the relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads\\na life of pure justice or pure injustice. The enquiry will then be\\ncompleted. And we shall know whether we ought to pursue injustice, as\\nThrasymachus advises, or in accordance with the conclusions of the\\nargument to prefer justice.\\n\\nCertainly, he replied, we must do as you say.\\n\\nShall we follow our old plan, which we adopted with a view to\\nclearness, of taking the State first and then proceeding to the\\nindividual, and begin with the government of honour?—I know of no name\\nfor such a government other than timocracy, or perhaps timarchy. We\\nwill compare with this the like character in the individual; and, after\\nthat, consider oligarchy and the oligarchical man; and then again we\\nwill turn our attention to democracy and the democratical man; and\\nlastly, we will go and view the city of tyranny, and once more take a\\nlook into the tyrant’s soul, and try to arrive at a satisfactory\\ndecision.\\n\\nThat way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very suitable.\\n\\nFirst, then, I said, let us enquire how timocracy (the government of\\nhonour) arises out of aristocracy (the government of the best).\\nClearly, all political changes originate in divisions of the actual\\ngoverning power; a government which is united, however small, cannot be\\nmoved.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nIn what way, then, will our city be moved, and in what manner will the\\ntwo classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with\\none another? Shall we, after the manner of Homer, pray the Muses to\\ntell us ‘how discord first arose’? Shall we imagine them in solemn\\nmockery, to play and jest with us as if we were children, and to\\naddress us in a lofty tragic vein, making believe to be in earnest?\\n\\nHow would they address us?\\n\\nAfter this manner:—A city which is thus constituted can hardly be\\nshaken; but, seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an\\nend, even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever, but will\\nin time be dissolved. And this is the dissolution:—In plants that grow\\nin the earth, as well as in animals that move on the earth’s surface,\\nfertility and sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences\\nof the circles of each are completed, which in short-lived existences\\npass over a short space, and in long-lived ones over a long space. But\\nto the knowledge of human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom and\\neducation of your rulers will not attain; the laws which regulate them\\nwill not be discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed with sense,\\nbut will escape them, and they will bring children into the world when\\nthey ought not. Now that which is of divine birth has a period which is\\ncontained in a perfect number (i.e. a cyclical number, such as 6, which\\nis equal to the sum of its divisors 1, 2, 3, so that when the circle or\\ntime represented by 6 is completed, the lesser times or rotations\\nrepresented by 1, 2, 3 are also completed.), but the period of human\\nbirth is comprehended in a number in which first increments by\\ninvolution and evolution (or squared and cubed) obtaining three\\nintervals and four terms of like and unlike, waxing and waning numbers,\\nmake all the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another.\\n(Probably the numbers 3, 4, 5, 6 of which the three first = the sides\\nof the Pythagorean triangle. The terms will then be 3 cubed, 4 cubed, 5\\ncubed, which together = 6 cubed = 216.) The base of these (3) with a\\nthird added (4) when combined with five (20) and raised to the third\\npower furnishes two harmonies; the first a square which is a hundred\\ntimes as great (400 = 4 x 100) (Or the first a square which is 100 x\\n100 = 10,000. The whole number will then be 17,500 = a square of 100,\\nand an oblong of 100 by 75.), and the other a figure having one side\\nequal to the former, but oblong, consisting of a hundred numbers\\nsquared upon rational diameters of a square (i.e. omitting fractions),\\nthe side of which is five (7 x 7 = 49 x 100 = 4900), each of them being\\nless by one (than the perfect square which includes the fractions, sc.\\n50) or less by (Or, ‘consisting of two numbers squared upon irrational\\ndiameters,’ etc. = 100. For other explanations of the passage see\\nIntroduction.) two perfect squares of irrational diameters (of a square\\nthe side of which is five = 50 + 50 = 100); and a hundred cubes of\\nthree (27 x 100 = 2700 + 4900 + 400 = 8000). Now this number represents\\na geometrical figure which has control over the good and evil of\\nbirths. For when your guardians are ignorant of the law of births, and\\nunite bride and bridegroom out of season, the children will not be\\ngoodly or fortunate. And though only the best of them will be appointed\\nby their predecessors, still they will be unworthy to hold their\\nfathers’ places, and when they come into power as guardians, they will\\nsoon be found to fail in taking care of us, the Muses, first by\\nunder-valuing music; which neglect will soon extend to gymnastic; and\\nhence the young men of your State will be less cultivated. In the\\nsucceeding generation rulers will be appointed who have lost the\\nguardian power of testing the metal of your different races, which,\\nlike Hesiod’s, are of gold and silver and brass and iron. And so iron\\nwill be mingled with silver, and brass with gold, and hence there will\\narise dissimilarity and inequality and irregularity, which always and\\nin all places are causes of hatred and war. This the Muses affirm to be\\nthe stock from which discord has sprung, wherever arising; and this is\\ntheir answer to us.\\n\\nYes, and we may assume that they answer truly.\\n\\nWhy, yes, I said, of course they answer truly; how can the Muses speak\\nfalsely?\\n\\nAnd what do the Muses say next?\\n\\nWhen discord arose, then the two races were drawn different ways: the\\niron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and\\nsilver; but the gold and silver races, not wanting money but having the\\ntrue riches in their own nature, inclined towards virtue and the\\nancient order of things. There was a battle between them, and at last\\nthey agreed to distribute their land and houses among individual\\nowners; and they enslaved their friends and maintainers, whom they had\\nformerly protected in the condition of freemen, and made of them\\nsubjects and servants; and they themselves were engaged in war and in\\nkeeping a watch against them.\\n\\nI believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change.\\n\\nAnd the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate\\nbetween oligarchy and aristocracy?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nSuch will be the change, and after the change has been made, how will\\nthey proceed? Clearly, the new State, being in a mean between oligarchy\\nand the perfect State, will partly follow one and partly the other, and\\nwill also have some peculiarities.\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nIn the honour given to rulers, in the abstinence of the warrior class\\nfrom agriculture, handicrafts, and trade in general, in the institution\\nof common meals, and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military\\ntraining—in all these respects this State will resemble the former.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nBut in the fear of admitting philosophers to power, because they are no\\nlonger to be had simple and earnest, but are made up of mixed elements;\\nand in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters, who\\nare by nature fitted for war rather than peace; and in the value set by\\nthem upon military stratagems and contrivances, and in the waging of\\neverlasting wars—this State will be for the most part peculiar.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nYes, I said; and men of this stamp will be covetous of money, like\\nthose who live in oligarchies; they will have, a fierce secret longing\\nafter gold and silver, which they will hoard in dark places, having\\nmagazines and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment\\nof them; also castles which are just nests for their eggs, and in which\\nthey will spend large sums on their wives, or on any others whom they\\nplease.\\n\\nThat is most true, he said.\\n\\nAnd they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring the\\nmoney which they prize; they will spend that which is another man’s on\\nthe gratification of their desires, stealing their pleasures and\\nrunning away like children from the law, their father: they have been\\nschooled not by gentle influences but by force, for they have neglected\\nher who is the true Muse, the companion of reason and philosophy, and\\nhave honoured gymnastic more than music.\\n\\nUndoubtedly, he said, the form of government which you describe is a\\nmixture of good and evil.\\n\\nWhy, there is a mixture, I said; but one thing, and one thing only, is\\npredominantly seen,—the spirit of contention and ambition; and these\\nare due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element.\\n\\nAssuredly, he said.\\n\\nSuch is the origin and such the character of this State, which has been\\ndescribed in outline only; the more perfect execution was not required,\\nfor a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and\\nmost perfectly unjust; and to go through all the States and all the\\ncharacters of men, omitting none of them, would be an interminable\\nlabour.\\n\\nVery true, he replied.\\n\\nNow what man answers to this form of government-how did he come into\\nbeing, and what is he like?\\n\\nI think, said Adeimantus, that in the spirit of contention which\\ncharacterises him, he is not unlike our friend Glaucon.\\n\\nPerhaps, I said, he may be like him in that one point; but there are\\nother respects in which he is very different.\\n\\nIn what respects?\\n\\nHe should have more of self-assertion and be less cultivated, and yet a\\nfriend of culture; and he should be a good listener, but no speaker.\\nSuch a person is apt to be rough with slaves, unlike the educated man,\\nwho is too proud for that; and he will also be courteous to freemen,\\nand remarkably obedient to authority; he is a lover of power and a\\nlover of honour; claiming to be a ruler, not because he is eloquent, or\\non any ground of that sort, but because he is a soldier and has\\nperformed feats of arms; he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and\\nof the chase.\\n\\nYes, that is the type of character which answers to timocracy.\\n\\nSuch an one will despise riches only when he is young; but as he gets\\nolder he will be more and more attracted to them, because he has a\\npiece of the avaricious nature in him, and is not single-minded towards\\nvirtue, having lost his best guardian.\\n\\nWho was that? said Adeimantus.\\n\\nPhilosophy, I said, tempered with music, who comes and takes up her\\nabode in a man, and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life.\\n\\nGood, he said.\\n\\nSuch, I said, is the timocratical youth, and he is like the\\ntimocratical State.\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nHis origin is as follows:—He is often the young son of a brave father,\\nwho dwells in an ill-governed city, of which he declines the honours\\nand offices, and will not go to law, or exert himself in any way, but\\nis ready to waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble.\\n\\nAnd how does the son come into being?\\n\\nThe character of the son begins to develope when he hears his mother\\ncomplaining that her husband has no place in the government, of which\\nthe consequence is that she has no precedence among other women.\\nFurther, when she sees her husband not very eager about money, and\\ninstead of battling and railing in the law courts or assembly, taking\\nwhatever happens to him quietly; and when she observes that his\\nthoughts always centre in himself, while he treats her with very\\nconsiderable indifference, she is annoyed, and says to her son that his\\nfather is only half a man and far too easy-going: adding all the other\\ncomplaints about her own ill-treatment which women are so fond of\\nrehearsing.\\n\\nYes, said Adeimantus, they give us plenty of them, and their complaints\\nare so like themselves.\\n\\nAnd you know, I said, that the old servants also, who are supposed to\\nbe attached to the family, from time to time talk privately in the same\\nstrain to the son; and if they see any one who owes money to his\\nfather, or is wronging him in any way, and he fails to prosecute them,\\nthey tell the youth that when he grows up he must retaliate upon people\\nof this sort, and be more of a man than his father. He has only to walk\\nabroad and he hears and sees the same sort of thing: those who do their\\nown business in the city are called simpletons, and held in no esteem,\\nwhile the busy-bodies are honoured and applauded. The result is that\\nthe young man, hearing and seeing all these things—hearing, too, the\\nwords of his father, and having a nearer view of his way of life, and\\nmaking comparisons of him and others—is drawn opposite ways: while his\\nfather is watering and nourishing the rational principle in his soul,\\nthe others are encouraging the passionate and appetitive; and he being\\nnot originally of a bad nature, but having kept bad company, is at last\\nbrought by their joint influence to a middle point, and gives up the\\nkingdom which is within him to the middle principle of contentiousness\\nand passion, and becomes arrogant and ambitious.\\n\\nYou seem to me to have described his origin perfectly.\\n\\nThen we have now, I said, the second form of government and the second\\ntype of character?\\n\\nWe have.\\n\\nNext, let us look at another man who, as Aeschylus says,\\n\\n‘Is set over against another State;’\\n\\nor rather, as our plan requires, begin with the State.\\n\\nBy all means.\\n\\nI believe that oligarchy follows next in order.\\n\\nAnd what manner of government do you term oligarchy?\\n\\nA government resting on a valuation of property, in which the rich have\\npower and the poor man is deprived of it.\\n\\nI understand, he replied.\\n\\nOught I not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to\\noligarchy arises?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nWell, I said, no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes\\ninto the other.\\n\\nHow?\\n\\nThe accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is the\\nruin of timocracy; they invent illegal modes of expenditure; for what\\ndo they or their wives care about the law?\\n\\nYes, indeed.\\n\\nAnd then one, seeing another grow rich, seeks to rival him, and thus\\nthe great mass of the citizens become lovers of money.\\n\\nLikely enough.\\n\\nAnd so they grow richer and richer, and the more they think of making a\\nfortune the less they think of virtue; for when riches and virtue are\\nplaced together in the scales of the balance, the one always rises as\\nthe other falls.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the State,\\nvirtue and the virtuous are dishonoured.\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nAnd what is honoured is cultivated, and that which has no honour is\\nneglected.\\n\\nThat is obvious.\\n\\nAnd so at last, instead of loving contention and glory, men become\\nlovers of trade and money; they honour and look up to the rich man, and\\nmake a ruler of him, and dishonour the poor man.\\n\\nThey do so.\\n\\nThey next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the\\nqualification of citizenship; the sum is higher in one place and lower\\nin another, as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive; and they allow\\nno one whose property falls below the amount fixed to have any share in\\nthe government. These changes in the constitution they effect by force\\nof arms, if intimidation has not already done their work.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd this, speaking generally, is the way in which oligarchy is\\nestablished.\\n\\nYes, he said; but what are the characteristics of this form of\\ngovernment, and what are the defects of which we were speaking?\\n\\nFirst of all, I said, consider the nature of the qualification. Just\\nthink what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their\\nproperty, and a poor man were refused permission to steer, even though\\nhe were a better pilot?\\n\\nYou mean that they would shipwreck?\\n\\nYes; and is not this true of the government of anything?\\n\\nI should imagine so.\\n\\nExcept a city?—or would you include a city?\\n\\nNay, he said, the case of a city is the strongest of all, inasmuch as\\nthe rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all.\\n\\nThis, then, will be the first great defect of oligarchy?\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nAnd here is another defect which is quite as bad.\\n\\nWhat defect?\\n\\nThe inevitable division: such a State is not one, but two States, the\\none of poor, the other of rich men; and they are living on the same\\nspot and always conspiring against one another.\\n\\nThat, surely, is at least as bad.\\n\\nAnother discreditable feature is, that, for a like reason, they are\\nincapable of carrying on any war. Either they arm the multitude, and\\nthen they are more afraid of them than of the enemy; or, if they do not\\ncall them out in the hour of battle, they are oligarchs indeed, few to\\nfight as they are few to rule. And at the same time their fondness for\\nmoney makes them unwilling to pay taxes.\\n\\nHow discreditable!\\n\\nAnd, as we said before, under such a constitution the same persons have\\ntoo many callings—they are husbandmen, tradesmen, warriors, all in one.\\nDoes that look well?\\n\\nAnything but well.\\n\\nThere is another evil which is, perhaps, the greatest of all, and to\\nwhich this State first begins to be liable.\\n\\nWhat evil?\\n\\nA man may sell all that he has, and another may acquire his property;\\nyet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a\\npart, being neither trader, nor artisan, nor horseman, nor hoplite, but\\nonly a poor, helpless creature.\\n\\nYes, that is an evil which also first begins in this State.\\n\\nThe evil is certainly not prevented there; for oligarchies have both\\nthe extremes of great wealth and utter poverty.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nBut think again: In his wealthy days, while he was spending his money,\\nwas a man of this sort a whit more good to the State for the purposes\\nof citizenship? Or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body,\\nalthough in truth he was neither ruler nor subject, but just a\\nspendthrift?\\n\\nAs you say, he seemed to be a ruler, but was only a spendthrift.\\n\\nMay we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the\\ndrone in the honeycomb, and that the one is the plague of the city as\\nthe other is of the hive?\\n\\nJust so, Socrates.\\n\\nAnd God has made the flying drones, Adeimantus, all without stings,\\nwhereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but\\nothers have dreadful stings; of the stingless class are those who in\\ntheir old age end as paupers; of the stingers come all the criminal\\nclass, as they are termed.\\n\\nMost true, he said.\\n\\nClearly then, whenever you see paupers in a State, somewhere in that\\nneighborhood there are hidden away thieves, and cut-purses and robbers\\nof temples, and all sorts of malefactors.\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nWell, I said, and in oligarchical States do you not find paupers?\\n\\nYes, he said; nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler.\\n\\nAnd may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals\\nto be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities\\nare careful to restrain by force?\\n\\nCertainly, we may be so bold.\\n\\nThe existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education,\\nill-training, and an evil constitution of the State?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nSuch, then, is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy; and there\\nmay be many other evils.\\n\\nVery likely.\\n\\nThen oligarchy, or the form of government in which the rulers are\\nelected for their wealth, may now be dismissed. Let us next proceed to\\nconsider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this\\nState.\\n\\nBy all means.\\n\\nDoes not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this\\nwise?\\n\\nHow?\\n\\nA time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son: at first\\nhe begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps, but\\npresently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the State as upon\\na sunken reef, and he and all that he has is lost; he may have been a\\ngeneral or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a\\nprejudice raised by informers, and either put to death, or exiled, or\\ndeprived of the privileges of a citizen, and all his property taken\\nfrom him.\\n\\nNothing more likely.\\n\\nAnd the son has seen and known all this—he is a ruined man, and his\\nfear has taught him to knock ambition and passion headforemost from his\\nbosom’s throne; humbled by poverty he takes to money-making and by mean\\nand miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together. Is not such\\nan one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the\\nvacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him, girt\\nwith tiara and chain and scimitar?\\n\\nMost true, he replied.\\n\\nAnd when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground\\nobediently on either side of their sovereign, and taught them to know\\ntheir place, he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be\\nturned into larger ones, and will not allow the other to worship and\\nadmire anything but riches and rich men, or to be ambitious of anything\\nso much as the acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it.\\n\\nOf all changes, he said, there is none so speedy or so sure as the\\nconversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one.\\n\\nAnd the avaricious, I said, is the oligarchical youth?\\n\\nYes, he said; at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like\\nthe State out of which oligarchy came.\\n\\nLet us then consider whether there is any likeness between them.\\n\\nVery good.\\n\\nFirst, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set upon\\nwealth?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAlso in their penurious, laborious character; the individual only\\nsatisfies his necessary appetites, and confines his expenditure to\\nthem; his other desires he subdues, under the idea that they are\\nunprofitable.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nHe is a shabby fellow, who saves something out of everything and makes\\na purse for himself; and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar\\napplaud. Is he not a true image of the State which he represents?\\n\\nHe appears to me to be so; at any rate money is highly valued by him as\\nwell as by the State.\\n\\nYou see that he is not a man of cultivation, I said.\\n\\nI imagine not, he said; had he been educated he would never have made a\\nblind god director of his chorus, or given him chief honour.\\n\\nExcellent! I said. Yet consider: Must we not further admit that owing\\nto this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike\\ndesires as of pauper and rogue, which are forcibly kept down by his\\ngeneral habit of life?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nDo you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his\\nrogueries?\\n\\nWhere must I look?\\n\\nYou should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting\\ndishonestly, as in the guardianship of an orphan.\\n\\nAye.\\n\\nIt will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give\\nhim a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced\\nvirtue; not making them see that they are wrong, or taming them by\\nreason, but by necessity and fear constraining them, and because he\\ntrembles for his possessions.\\n\\nTo be sure.\\n\\nYes, indeed, my dear friend, but you will find that the natural desires\\nof the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to\\nspend what is not his own.\\n\\nYes, and they will be strong in him too.\\n\\nThe man, then, will be at war with himself; he will be two men, and not\\none; but, in general, his better desires will be found to prevail over\\nhis inferior ones.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nFor these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most\\npeople; yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will\\nflee far away and never come near him.\\n\\nI should expect so.\\n\\nAnd surely, the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in a\\nState for any prize of victory, or other object of honourable ambition;\\nhe will not spend his money in the contest for glory; so afraid is he\\nof awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join\\nin the struggle; in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small\\npart only of his resources, and the result commonly is that he loses\\nthe prize and saves his money.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nCan we any longer doubt, then, that the miser and money-maker answers\\nto the oligarchical State?\\n\\nThere can be no doubt.\\n\\nNext comes democracy; of this the origin and nature have still to be\\nconsidered by us; and then we will enquire into the ways of the\\ndemocratic man, and bring him up for judgment.\\n\\nThat, he said, is our method.\\n\\nWell, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy\\narise? Is it not on this wise?—The good at which such a State aims is\\nto become as rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?\\n\\nWhat then?\\n\\nThe rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth,\\nrefuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth\\nbecause they gain by their ruin; they take interest from them and buy\\nup their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance?\\n\\nTo be sure.\\n\\nThere can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of\\nmoderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any\\nconsiderable extent; one or the other will be disregarded.\\n\\nThat is tolerably clear.\\n\\nAnd in oligarchical States, from the general spread of carelessness and\\nextravagance, men of good family have often been reduced to beggary?\\n\\nYes, often.\\n\\nAnd still they remain in the city; there they are, ready to sting and\\nfully armed, and some of them owe money, some have forfeited their\\ncitizenship; a third class are in both predicaments; and they hate and\\nconspire against those who have got their property, and against\\neverybody else, and are eager for revolution.\\n\\nThat is true.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the men of business, stooping as they walk, and\\npretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined, insert\\ntheir sting—that is, their money—into some one else who is not on his\\nguard against them, and recover the parent sum many times over\\nmultiplied into a family of children: and so they make drone and pauper\\nto abound in the State.\\n\\nYes, he said, there are plenty of them—that is certain.\\n\\nThe evil blazes up like a fire; and they will not extinguish it, either\\nby restricting a man’s use of his own property, or by another remedy:\\n\\nWhat other?\\n\\nOne which is the next best, and has the advantage of compelling the\\ncitizens to look to their characters:—Let there be a general rule that\\nevery one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk, and\\nthere will be less of this scandalous money-making, and the evils of\\nwhich we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the State.\\n\\nYes, they will be greatly lessened.\\n\\nAt present the governors, induced by the motives which I have named,\\ntreat their subjects badly; while they and their adherents, especially\\nthe young men of the governing class, are habituated to lead a life of\\nluxury and idleness both of body and mind; they do nothing, and are\\nincapable of resisting either pleasure or pain.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nThey themselves care only for making money, and are as indifferent as\\nthe pauper to the cultivation of virtue.\\n\\nYes, quite as indifferent.\\n\\nSuch is the state of affairs which prevails among them. And often\\nrulers and their subjects may come in one another’s way, whether on a\\njourney or on some other occasion of meeting, on a pilgrimage or a\\nmarch, as fellow-soldiers or fellow-sailors; aye and they may observe\\nthe behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger—for where\\ndanger is, there is no fear that the poor will be despised by the\\nrich—and very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle\\nat the side of a wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and\\nhas plenty of superfluous flesh—when he sees such an one puffing and at\\nhis wits’-end, how can he avoid drawing the conclusion that men like\\nhim are only rich because no one has the courage to despoil them? And\\nwhen they meet in private will not people be saying to one another ‘Our\\nwarriors are not good for much’?\\n\\nYes, he said, I am quite aware that this is their way of talking.\\n\\nAnd, as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from\\nwithout may bring on illness, and sometimes even when there is no\\nexternal provocation a commotion may arise within—in the same way\\nwherever there is weakness in the State there is also likely to be\\nillness, of which the occasion may be very slight, the one party\\nintroducing from without their oligarchical, the other their\\ndemocratical allies, and then the State falls sick, and is at war with\\nherself; and may be at times distracted, even when there is no external\\ncause.\\n\\nYes, surely.\\n\\nAnd then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their\\nopponents, slaughtering some and banishing some, while to the remainder\\nthey give an equal share of freedom and power; and this is the form of\\ngovernment in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot.\\n\\nYes, he said, that is the nature of democracy, whether the revolution\\nhas been effected by arms, or whether fear has caused the opposite\\nparty to withdraw.\\n\\nAnd now what is their manner of life, and what sort of a government\\nhave they? for as the government is, such will be the man.\\n\\nClearly, he said.\\n\\nIn the first place, are they not free; and is not the city full of\\nfreedom and frankness—a man may say and do what he likes?\\n\\n’Tis said so, he replied.\\n\\nAnd where freedom is, the individual is clearly able to order for\\nhimself his own life as he pleases?\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nThen in this kind of State there will be the greatest variety of human\\nnatures?\\n\\nThere will.\\n\\nThis, then, seems likely to be the fairest of States, being like an\\nembroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower. And just\\nas women and children think a variety of colours to be of all things\\nmost charming, so there are many men to whom this State, which is\\nspangled with the manners and characters of mankind, will appear to be\\nthe fairest of States.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nYes, my good Sir, and there will be no better in which to look for a\\ngovernment.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nBecause of the liberty which reigns there—they have a complete\\nassortment of constitutions; and he who has a mind to establish a\\nState, as we have been doing, must go to a democracy as he would to a\\nbazaar at which they sell them, and pick out the one that suits him;\\nthen, when he has made his choice, he may found his State.\\n\\nHe will be sure to have patterns enough.\\n\\nAnd there being no necessity, I said, for you to govern in this State,\\neven if you have the capacity, or to be governed, unless you like, or\\ngo to war when the rest go to war, or to be at peace when others are at\\npeace, unless you are so disposed—there being no necessity also,\\nbecause some law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast, that you\\nshould not hold office or be a dicast, if you have a fancy—is not this\\na way of life which for the moment is supremely delightful?\\n\\nFor the moment, yes.\\n\\nAnd is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite\\ncharming? Have you not observed how, in a democracy, many persons,\\nalthough they have been sentenced to death or exile, just stay where\\nthey are and walk about the world—the gentleman parades like a hero,\\nand nobody sees or cares?\\n\\nYes, he replied, many and many a one.\\n\\nSee too, I said, the forgiving spirit of democracy, and the ‘don’t\\ncare’ about trifles, and the disregard which she shows of all the fine\\nprinciples which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the city—as\\nwhen we said that, except in the case of some rarely gifted nature,\\nthere never will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used\\nto play amid things of beauty and make of them a joy and a study—how\\ngrandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet,\\nnever giving a thought to the pursuits which make a statesman, and\\npromoting to honour any one who professes to be the people’s friend.\\n\\nYes, she is of a noble spirit.\\n\\nThese and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy, which\\nis a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and\\ndispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike.\\n\\nWe know her well.\\n\\nConsider now, I said, what manner of man the individual is, or rather\\nconsider, as in the case of the State, how he comes into being.\\n\\nVery good, he said.\\n\\nIs not this the way—he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical\\nfather who has trained him in his own habits?\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nAnd, like his father, he keeps under by force the pleasures which are\\nof the spending and not of the getting sort, being those which are\\ncalled unnecessary?\\n\\nObviously.\\n\\nWould you like, for the sake of clearness, to distinguish which are the\\nnecessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures?\\n\\nI should.\\n\\nAre not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid, and of\\nwhich the satisfaction is a benefit to us? And they are rightly called\\nso, because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial\\nand what is necessary, and cannot help it.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nWe are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?\\n\\nWe are not.\\n\\nAnd the desires of which a man may get rid, if he takes pains from his\\nyouth upwards—of which the presence, moreover, does no good, and in\\nsome cases the reverse of good—shall we not be right in saying that all\\nthese are unnecessary?\\n\\nYes, certainly.\\n\\nSuppose we select an example of either kind, in order that we may have\\na general notion of them?\\n\\nVery good.\\n\\nWill not the desire of eating, that is, of simple food and condiments,\\nin so far as they are required for health and strength, be of the\\nnecessary class?\\n\\nThat is what I should suppose.\\n\\nThe pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways; it does us good and it\\nis essential to the continuance of life?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nBut the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for\\nhealth?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd the desire which goes beyond this, of more delicate food, or other\\nluxuries, which might generally be got rid of, if controlled and\\ntrained in youth, and is hurtful to the body, and hurtful to the soul\\nin the pursuit of wisdom and virtue, may be rightly called unnecessary?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nMay we not say that these desires spend, and that the others make money\\nbecause they conduce to production?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds\\ngood?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures\\nand desires of this sort, and was the slave of the unnecessary desires,\\nwhereas he who was subject to the necessary only was miserly and\\noligarchical?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAgain, let us see how the democratical man grows out of the\\noligarchical: the following, as I suspect, is commonly the process.\\n\\nWhat is the process?\\n\\nWhen a young man who has been brought up as we were just now\\ndescribing, in a vulgar and miserly way, has tasted drones’ honey and\\nhas come to associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to\\nprovide for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of\\npleasure—then, as you may imagine, the change will begin of the\\noligarchical principle within him into the democratical?\\n\\nInevitably.\\n\\nAnd as in the city like was helping like, and the change was effected\\nby an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens, so\\ntoo the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without\\nto assist the desires within him, that which is akin and alike again\\nhelping that which is akin and alike?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within\\nhim, whether the influence of a father or of kindred, advising or\\nrebuking him, then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite\\nfaction, and he goes to war with himself.\\n\\nIt must be so.\\n\\nAnd there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the\\noligarchical, and some of his desires die, and others are banished; a\\nspirit of reverence enters into the young man’s soul and order is\\nrestored.\\n\\nYes, he said, that sometimes happens.\\n\\nAnd then, again, after the old desires have been driven out, fresh ones\\nspring up, which are akin to them, and because he their father does not\\nknow how to educate them, wax fierce and numerous.\\n\\nYes, he said, that is apt to be the way.\\n\\nThey draw him to his old associates, and holding secret intercourse\\nwith them, breed and multiply in him.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAt length they seize upon the citadel of the young man’s soul, which\\nthey perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and\\ntrue words, which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to\\nthe gods, and are their best guardians and sentinels.\\n\\nNone better.\\n\\nFalse and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their\\nplace.\\n\\nThey are certain to do so.\\n\\nAnd so the young man returns into the country of the lotus-eaters, and\\ntakes up his dwelling there in the face of all men; and if any help be\\nsent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him, the aforesaid vain\\nconceits shut the gate of the king’s fastness; and they will neither\\nallow the embassy itself to enter, nor if private advisers offer the\\nfatherly counsel of the aged will they listen to them or receive them.\\nThere is a battle and they gain the day, and then modesty, which they\\ncall silliness, is ignominiously thrust into exile by them, and\\ntemperance, which they nickname unmanliness, is trampled in the mire\\nand cast forth; they persuade men that moderation and orderly\\nexpenditure are vulgarity and meanness, and so, by the help of a rabble\\nof evil appetites, they drive them beyond the border.\\n\\nYes, with a will.\\n\\nAnd when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is now\\nin their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries,\\nthe next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy\\nand waste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads,\\nand a great company with them, hymning their praises and calling them\\nby sweet names; insolence they term breeding, and anarchy liberty, and\\nwaste magnificence, and impudence courage. And so the young man passes\\nout of his original nature, which was trained in the school of\\nnecessity, into the freedom and libertinism of useless and unnecessary\\npleasures.\\n\\nYes, he said, the change in him is visible enough.\\n\\nAfter this he lives on, spending his money and labour and time on\\nunnecessary pleasures quite as much as on necessary ones; but if he be\\nfortunate, and is not too much disordered in his wits, when years have\\nelapsed, and the heyday of passion is over—supposing that he then\\nre-admits into the city some part of the exiled virtues, and does not\\nwholly give himself up to their successors—in that case he balances his\\npleasures and lives in a sort of equilibrium, putting the government of\\nhimself into the hands of the one which comes first and wins the turn;\\nand when he has had enough of that, then into the hands of another; he\\ndespises none of them but encourages them all equally.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nNeither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of\\nadvice; if any one says to him that some pleasures are the\\nsatisfactions of good and noble desires, and others of evil desires,\\nand that he ought to use and honour some and chastise and master the\\nothers—whenever this is repeated to him he shakes his head and says\\nthat they are all alike, and that one is as good as another.\\n\\nYes, he said; that is the way with him.\\n\\nYes, I said, he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the\\nhour; and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute;\\nthen he becomes a water-drinker, and tries to get thin; then he takes a\\nturn at gymnastics; sometimes idling and neglecting everything, then\\nonce more living the life of a philosopher; often he is busy with\\npolitics, and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into\\nhis head; and, if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior, off he is\\nin that direction, or of men of business, once more in that. His life\\nhas neither law nor order; and this distracted existence he terms joy\\nand bliss and freedom; and so he goes on.\\n\\nYes, he replied, he is all liberty and equality.\\n\\nYes, I said; his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the\\nlives of many;—he answers to the State which we described as fair and\\nspangled. And many a man and many a woman will take him for their\\npattern, and many a constitution and many an example of manners is\\ncontained in him.\\n\\nJust so.\\n\\nLet him then be set over against democracy; he may truly be called the\\ndemocratic man.\\n\\nLet that be his place, he said.\\n\\nLast of all comes the most beautiful of all, man and State alike,\\ntyranny and the tyrant; these we have now to consider.\\n\\nQuite true, he said.\\n\\nSay then, my friend, In what manner does tyranny arise?—that it has a\\ndemocratic origin is evident.\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nAnd does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as\\ndemocracy from oligarchy—I mean, after a sort?\\n\\nHow?\\n\\nThe good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it\\nwas maintained was excess of wealth—am I not right?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things\\nfor the sake of money-getting was also the ruin of oligarchy?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire brings\\nher to dissolution?\\n\\nWhat good?\\n\\nFreedom, I replied; which, as they tell you in a democracy, is the\\nglory of the State—and that therefore in a democracy alone will the\\nfreeman of nature deign to dwell.\\n\\nYes; the saying is in every body’s mouth.\\n\\nI was going to observe, that the insatiable desire of this and the\\nneglect of other things introduces the change in democracy, which\\noccasions a demand for tyranny.\\n\\nHow so?\\n\\nWhen a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cup-bearers\\npresiding over the feast, and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine\\nof freedom, then, unless her rulers are very amenable and give a\\nplentiful draught, she calls them to account and punishes them, and\\nsays that they are cursed oligarchs.\\n\\nYes, he replied, a very common occurrence.\\n\\nYes, I said; and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves\\nwho hug their chains and men of naught; she would have subjects who are\\nlike rulers, and rulers who are like subjects: these are men after her\\nown heart, whom she praises and honours both in private and public.\\nNow, in such a State, can liberty have any limit?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nBy degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses, and ends by\\ngetting among the animals and infecting them.\\n\\nHow do you mean?\\n\\nI mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his\\nsons and to fear them, and the son is on a level with his father, he\\nhaving no respect or reverence for either of his parents; and this is\\nhis freedom, and the metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen\\nwith the metic, and the stranger is quite as good as either.\\n\\nYes, he said, that is the way.\\n\\nAnd these are not the only evils, I said—there are several lesser ones:\\nIn such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars,\\nand the scholars despise their masters and tutors; young and old are\\nall alike; and the young man is on a level with the old, and is ready\\nto compete with him in word or deed; and old men condescend to the\\nyoung and are full of pleasantry and gaiety; they are loth to be\\nthought morose and authoritative, and therefore they adopt the manners\\nof the young.\\n\\nQuite true, he said.\\n\\nThe last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with\\nmoney, whether male or female, is just as free as his or her purchaser;\\nnor must I forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes\\nin relation to each other.\\n\\nWhy not, as Aeschylus says, utter the word which rises to our lips?\\n\\nThat is what I am doing, I replied; and I must add that no one who does\\nnot know would believe, how much greater is the liberty which the\\nanimals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in\\nany other State: for truly, the she-dogs, as the proverb says, are as\\ngood as their she-mistresses, and the horses and asses have a way of\\nmarching along with all the rights and dignities of freemen; and they\\nwill run at any body who comes in their way if he does not leave the\\nroad clear for them: and all things are just ready to burst with\\nliberty.\\n\\nWhen I take a country walk, he said, I often experience what you\\ndescribe. You and I have dreamed the same thing.\\n\\nAnd above all, I said, and as the result of all, see how sensitive the\\ncitizens become; they chafe impatiently at the least touch of\\nauthority, and at length, as you know, they cease to care even for the\\nlaws, written or unwritten; they will have no one over them.\\n\\nYes, he said, I know it too well.\\n\\nSuch, my friend, I said, is the fair and glorious beginning out of\\nwhich springs tyranny.\\n\\nGlorious indeed, he said. But what is the next step?\\n\\nThe ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same disease\\nmagnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy—the truth\\nbeing that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction\\nin the opposite direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons\\nand in vegetable and animal life, but above all in forms of government.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThe excess of liberty, whether in States or individuals, seems only to\\npass into excess of slavery.\\n\\nYes, the natural order.\\n\\nAnd so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most\\naggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of\\nliberty?\\n\\nAs we might expect.\\n\\nThat, however, was not, as I believe, your question—you rather desired\\nto know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and\\ndemocracy, and is the ruin of both?\\n\\nJust so, he replied.\\n\\nWell, I said, I meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts, of\\nwhom the more courageous are the leaders and the more timid the\\nfollowers, the same whom we were comparing to drones, some stingless,\\nand others having stings.\\n\\nA very just comparison.\\n\\nThese two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are\\ngenerated, being what phlegm and bile are to the body. And the good\\nphysician and lawgiver of the State ought, like the wise bee-master, to\\nkeep them at a distance and prevent, if possible, their ever coming in;\\nand if they have anyhow found a way in, then he should have them and\\ntheir cells cut out as speedily as possible.\\n\\nYes, by all means, he said.\\n\\nThen, in order that we may see clearly what we are doing, let us\\nimagine democracy to be divided, as indeed it is, into three classes;\\nfor in the first place freedom creates rather more drones in the\\ndemocratic than there were in the oligarchical State.\\n\\nThat is true.\\n\\nAnd in the democracy they are certainly more intensified.\\n\\nHow so?\\n\\nBecause in the oligarchical State they are disqualified and driven from\\noffice, and therefore they cannot train or gather strength; whereas in\\na democracy they are almost the entire ruling power, and while the\\nkeener sort speak and act, the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do\\nnot suffer a word to be said on the other side; hence in democracies\\nalmost everything is managed by the drones.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nThen there is another class which is always being severed from the\\nmass.\\n\\nWhat is that?\\n\\nThey are the orderly class, which in a nation of traders is sure to be\\nthe richest.\\n\\nNaturally so.\\n\\nThey are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of\\nhoney to the drones.\\n\\nWhy, he said, there is little to be squeezed out of people who have\\nlittle.\\n\\nAnd this is called the wealthy class, and the drones feed upon them.\\n\\nThat is pretty much the case, he said.\\n\\nThe people are a third class, consisting of those who work with their\\nown hands; they are not politicians, and have not much to live upon.\\nThis, when assembled, is the largest and most powerful class in a\\ndemocracy.\\n\\nTrue, he said; but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate\\nunless they get a little honey.\\n\\nAnd do they not share? I said. Do not their leaders deprive the rich of\\ntheir estates and distribute them among the people; at the same time\\ntaking care to reserve the larger part for themselves?\\n\\nWhy, yes, he said, to that extent the people do share.\\n\\nAnd the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to\\ndefend themselves before the people as they best can?\\n\\nWhat else can they do?\\n\\nAnd then, although they may have no desire of change, the others charge\\nthem with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd the end is that when they see the people, not of their own accord,\\nbut through ignorance, and because they are deceived by informers,\\nseeking to do them wrong, then at last they are forced to become\\noligarchs in reality; they do not wish to be, but the sting of the\\ndrones torments them and breeds revolution in them.\\n\\nThat is exactly the truth.\\n\\nThen come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThe people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse\\ninto greatness.\\n\\nYes, that is their way.\\n\\nThis and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he\\nfirst appears above ground he is a protector.\\n\\nYes, that is quite clear.\\n\\nHow then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant? Clearly when\\nhe does what the man is said to do in the tale of the Arcadian temple\\nof Lycaean Zeus.\\n\\nWhat tale?\\n\\nThe tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human\\nvictim minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to\\nbecome a wolf. Did you never hear it?\\n\\nOh, yes.\\n\\nAnd the protector of the people is like him; having a mob entirely at\\nhis disposal, he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen;\\nby the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court\\nand murders them, making the life of man to disappear, and with unholy\\ntongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizens; some he kills\\nand others he banishes, at the same time hinting at the abolition of\\ndebts and partition of lands: and after this, what will be his destiny?\\nMust he not either perish at the hands of his enemies, or from being a\\nman become a wolf—that is, a tyrant?\\n\\nInevitably.\\n\\nThis, I said, is he who begins to make a party against the rich?\\n\\nThe same.\\n\\nAfter a while he is driven out, but comes back, in spite of his\\nenemies, a tyrant full grown.\\n\\nThat is clear.\\n\\nAnd if they are unable to expel him, or to get him condemned to death\\nby a public accusation, they conspire to assassinate him.\\n\\nYes, he said, that is their usual way.\\n\\nThen comes the famous request for a body-guard, which is the device of\\nall those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career—‘Let not the\\npeople’s friend,’ as they say, ‘be lost to them.’\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nThe people readily assent; all their fears are for him—they have none\\nfor themselves.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy of\\nthe people sees this, then, my friend, as the oracle said to Croesus,\\n\\n‘By pebbly Hermus’ shore he flees and rests not, and is not ashamed to\\nbe a coward.’\\n\\nAnd quite right too, said he, for if he were, he would never be ashamed\\nagain.\\n\\nBut if he is caught he dies.\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nAnd he, the protector of whom we spoke, is to be seen, not ‘larding the\\nplain’ with his bulk, but himself the overthrower of many, standing up\\nin the chariot of State with the reins in his hand, no longer\\nprotector, but tyrant absolute.\\n\\nNo doubt, he said.\\n\\nAnd now let us consider the happiness of the man, and also of the State\\nin which a creature like him is generated.\\n\\nYes, he said, let us consider that.\\n\\nAt first, in the early days of his power, he is full of smiles, and he\\nsalutes every one whom he meets;—he to be called a tyrant, who is\\nmaking promises in public and also in private! liberating debtors, and\\ndistributing land to the people and his followers, and wanting to be so\\nkind and good to every one!\\n\\nOf course, he said.\\n\\nBut when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty, and\\nthere is nothing to fear from them, then he is always stirring up some\\nwar or other, in order that the people may require a leader.\\n\\nTo be sure.\\n\\nHas he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished\\nby payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their\\ndaily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him?\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nAnd if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom,\\nand of resistance to his authority, he will have a good pretext for\\ndestroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy; and for all\\nthese reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war.\\n\\nHe must.\\n\\nNow he begins to grow unpopular.\\n\\nA necessary result.\\n\\nThen some of those who joined in setting him up, and who are in power,\\nspeak their minds to him and to one another, and the more courageous of\\nthem cast in his teeth what is being done.\\n\\nYes, that may be expected.\\n\\nAnd the tyrant, if he means to rule, must get rid of them; he cannot\\nstop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything.\\n\\nHe cannot.\\n\\nAnd therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant, who is\\nhigh-minded, who is wise, who is wealthy; happy man, he is the enemy of\\nthem all, and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no,\\nuntil he has made a purgation of the State.\\n\\nYes, he said, and a rare purgation.\\n\\nYes, I said, not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of the\\nbody; for they take away the worse and leave the better part, but he\\ndoes the reverse.\\n\\nIf he is to rule, I suppose that he cannot help himself.\\n\\nWhat a blessed alternative, I said:—to be compelled to dwell only with\\nthe many bad, and to be by them hated, or not to live at all!\\n\\nYes, that is the alternative.\\n\\nAnd the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more\\nsatellites and the greater devotion in them will he require?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd who are the devoted band, and where will he procure them?\\n\\nThey will flock to him, he said, of their own accord, if he pays them.\\n\\nBy the dog! I said, here are more drones, of every sort and from every\\nland.\\n\\nYes, he said, there are.\\n\\nBut will he not desire to get them on the spot?\\n\\nHow do you mean?\\n\\nHe will rob the citizens of their slaves; he will then set them free\\nand enrol them in his body-guard.\\n\\nTo be sure, he said; and he will be able to trust them best of all.\\n\\nWhat a blessed creature, I said, must this tyrant be; he has put to\\ndeath the others and has these for his trusted friends.\\n\\nYes, he said; they are quite of his sort.\\n\\nYes, I said, and these are the new citizens whom he has called into\\nexistence, who admire him and are his companions, while the good hate\\nand avoid him.\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nVerily, then, tragedy is a wise thing and Euripides a great tragedian.\\n\\nWhy so?\\n\\nWhy, because he is the author of the pregnant saying,\\n\\n‘Tyrants are wise by living with the wise;’\\n\\nand he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant\\nmakes his companions.\\n\\nYes, he said, and he also praises tyranny as godlike; and many other\\nthings of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets.\\n\\nAnd therefore, I said, the tragic poets being wise men will forgive us\\nand any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into\\nour State, because they are the eulogists of tyranny.\\n\\nYes, he said, those who have the wit will doubtless forgive us.\\n\\nBut they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs, and hire\\nvoices fair and loud and persuasive, and draw the cities over to\\ntyrannies and democracies.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nMoreover, they are paid for this and receive honour—the greatest\\nhonour, as might be expected, from tyrants, and the next greatest from\\ndemocracies; but the higher they ascend our constitution hill, the more\\ntheir reputation fails, and seems unable from shortness of breath to\\nproceed further.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nBut we are wandering from the subject: Let us therefore return and\\nenquire how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various\\nand ever-changing army of his.\\n\\nIf, he said, there are sacred treasures in the city, he will confiscate\\nand spend them; and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons may\\nsuffice, he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise\\nhave to impose upon the people.\\n\\nAnd when these fail?\\n\\nWhy, clearly, he said, then he and his boon companions, whether male or\\nfemale, will be maintained out of his father’s estate.\\n\\nYou mean to say that the people, from whom he has derived his being,\\nwill maintain him and his companions?\\n\\nYes, he said; they cannot help themselves.\\n\\nBut what if the people fly into a passion, and aver that a grown-up son\\nought not to be supported by his father, but that the father should be\\nsupported by the son? The father did not bring him into being, or\\nsettle him in life, in order that when his son became a man he should\\nhimself be the servant of his own servants and should support him and\\nhis rabble of slaves and companions; but that his son should protect\\nhim, and that by his help he might be emancipated from the government\\nof the rich and aristocratic, as they are termed. And so he bids him\\nand his companions depart, just as any other father might drive out of\\nthe house a riotous son and his undesirable associates.\\n\\nBy heaven, he said, then the parent will discover what a monster he has\\nbeen fostering in his bosom; and, when he wants to drive him out, he\\nwill find that he is weak and his son strong.\\n\\nWhy, you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence? What!\\nbeat his father if he opposes him?\\n\\nYes, he will, having first disarmed him.\\n\\nThen he is a parricide, and a cruel guardian of an aged parent; and\\nthis is real tyranny, about which there can be no longer a mistake: as\\nthe saying is, the people who would escape the smoke which is the\\nslavery of freemen, has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of\\nslaves. Thus liberty, getting out of all order and reason, passes into\\nthe harshest and bitterest form of slavery.\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nVery well; and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently\\ndiscussed the nature of tyranny, and the manner of the transition from\\ndemocracy to tyranny?\\n\\nYes, quite enough, he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n BOOK IX.\\n\\n\\nLast of all comes the tyrannical man; about whom we have once more to\\nask, how is he formed out of the democratical? and how does he live, in\\nhappiness or in misery?\\n\\nYes, he said, he is the only one remaining.\\n\\nThere is, however, I said, a previous question which remains\\nunanswered.\\n\\nWhat question?\\n\\nI do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number\\nof the appetites, and until this is accomplished the enquiry will\\nalways be confused.\\n\\nWell, he said, it is not too late to supply the omission.\\n\\nVery true, I said; and observe the point which I want to understand:\\nCertain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites I conceive to be\\nunlawful; every one appears to have them, but in some persons they are\\ncontrolled by the laws and by reason, and the better desires prevail\\nover them—either they are wholly banished or they become few and weak;\\nwhile in the case of others they are stronger, and there are more of\\nthem.\\n\\nWhich appetites do you mean?\\n\\nI mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling\\npower is asleep; then the wild beast within us, gorged with meat or\\ndrink, starts up and having shaken off sleep, goes forth to satisfy his\\ndesires; and there is no conceivable folly or crime—not excepting\\nincest or any other unnatural union, or parricide, or the eating of\\nforbidden food—which at such a time, when he has parted company with\\nall shame and sense, a man may not be ready to commit.\\n\\nMost true, he said.\\n\\nBut when a man’s pulse is healthy and temperate, and when before going\\nto sleep he has awakened his rational powers, and fed them on noble\\nthoughts and enquiries, collecting himself in meditation; after having\\nfirst indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little, but just\\nenough to lay them to sleep, and prevent them and their enjoyments and\\npains from interfering with the higher principle—which he leaves in the\\nsolitude of pure abstraction, free to contemplate and aspire to the\\nknowledge of the unknown, whether in past, present, or future: when\\nagain he has allayed the passionate element, if he has a quarrel\\nagainst any one—I say, when, after pacifying the two irrational\\nprinciples, he rouses up the third, which is reason, before he takes\\nhis rest, then, as you know, he attains truth most nearly, and is least\\nlikely to be the sport of fantastic and lawless visions.\\n\\nI quite agree.\\n\\nIn saying this I have been running into a digression; but the point\\nwhich I desire to note is that in all of us, even in good men, there is\\na lawless wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep. Pray, consider\\nwhether I am right, and you agree with me.\\n\\nYes, I agree.\\n\\nAnd now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic\\nman. He was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under\\na miserly parent, who encouraged the saving appetites in him, but\\ndiscountenanced the unnecessary, which aim only at amusement and\\nornament?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd then he got into the company of a more refined, licentious sort of\\npeople, and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite\\nextreme from an abhorrence of his father’s meanness. At last, being a\\nbetter man than his corruptors, he was drawn in both directions until\\nhe halted midway and led a life, not of vulgar and slavish passion, but\\nof what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures. After this\\nmanner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch?\\n\\nYes, he said; that was our view of him, and is so still.\\n\\nAnd now, I said, years will have passed away, and you must conceive\\nthis man, such as he is, to have a son, who is brought up in his\\nfather’s principles.\\n\\nI can imagine him.\\n\\nThen you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which\\nhas already happened to the father:—he is drawn into a perfectly\\nlawless life, which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty; and his\\nfather and friends take part with his moderate desires, and the\\nopposite party assist the opposite ones. As soon as these dire\\nmagicians and tyrant-makers find that they are losing their hold on\\nhim, they contrive to implant in him a master passion, to be lord over\\nhis idle and spendthrift lusts—a sort of monstrous winged drone—that is\\nthe only image which will adequately describe him.\\n\\nYes, he said, that is the only adequate image of him.\\n\\nAnd when his other lusts, amid clouds of incense and perfumes and\\ngarlands and wines, and all the pleasures of a dissolute life, now let\\nloose, come buzzing around him, nourishing to the utmost the sting of\\ndesire which they implant in his drone-like nature, then at last this\\nlord of the soul, having Madness for the captain of his guard, breaks\\nout into a frenzy: and if he finds in himself any good opinions or\\nappetites in process of formation, and there is in him any sense of\\nshame remaining, to these better principles he puts an end, and casts\\nthem forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness\\nto the full.\\n\\nYes, he said, that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated.\\n\\nAnd is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?\\n\\nI should not wonder.\\n\\nFurther, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?\\n\\nHe has.\\n\\nAnd you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind, will\\nfancy that he is able to rule, not only over men, but also over the\\ngods?\\n\\nThat he will.\\n\\nAnd the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being\\nwhen, either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he\\nbecomes drunken, lustful, passionate? O my friend, is not that so?\\n\\nAssuredly.\\n\\nSuch is the man and such is his origin. And next, how does he live?\\n\\nSuppose, as people facetiously say, you were to tell me.\\n\\nI imagine, I said, at the next step in his progress, that there will be\\nfeasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans, and all that sort\\nof thing; Love is the lord of the house within him, and orders all the\\nconcerns of his soul.\\n\\nThat is certain.\\n\\nYes; and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable,\\nand their demands are many.\\n\\nThey are indeed, he said.\\n\\nHis revenues, if he has any, are soon spent.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThen comes debt and the cutting down of his property.\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nWhen he has nothing left, must not his desires, crowding in the nest\\nlike young ravens, be crying aloud for food; and he, goaded on by them,\\nand especially by love himself, who is in a manner the captain of them,\\nis in a frenzy, and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil\\nof his property, in order that he may gratify them?\\n\\nYes, that is sure to be the case.\\n\\nHe must have money, no matter how, if he is to escape horrid pains and\\npangs.\\n\\nHe must.\\n\\nAnd as in himself there was a succession of pleasures, and the new got\\nthe better of the old and took away their rights, so he being younger\\nwill claim to have more than his father and his mother, and if he has\\nspent his own share of the property, he will take a slice of theirs.\\n\\nNo doubt he will.\\n\\nAnd if his parents will not give way, then he will try first of all to\\ncheat and deceive them.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd if he fails, then he will use force and plunder them.\\n\\nYes, probably.\\n\\nAnd if the old man and woman fight for their own, what then, my friend?\\nWill the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them?\\n\\nNay, he said, I should not feel at all comfortable about his parents.\\n\\nBut, O heavens! Adeimantus, on account of some new-fangled love of a\\nharlot, who is anything but a necessary connection, can you believe\\nthat he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary\\nto his very existence, and would place her under the authority of the\\nother, when she is brought under the same roof with her; or that, under\\nlike circumstances, he would do the same to his withered old father,\\nfirst and most indispensable of friends, for the sake of some\\nnewly-found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable?\\n\\nYes, indeed, he said; I believe that he would.\\n\\nTruly, then, I said, a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and\\nmother.\\n\\nHe is indeed, he replied.\\n\\nHe first takes their property, and when that fails, and pleasures are\\nbeginning to swarm in the hive of his soul, then he breaks into a\\nhouse, or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer; next he\\nproceeds to clear a temple. Meanwhile the old opinions which he had\\nwhen a child, and which gave judgment about good and evil, are\\noverthrown by those others which have just been emancipated, and are\\nnow the body-guard of love and share his empire. These in his\\ndemocratic days, when he was still subject to the laws and to his\\nfather, were only let loose in the dreams of sleep. But now that he is\\nunder the dominion of love, he becomes always and in waking reality\\nwhat he was then very rarely and in a dream only; he will commit the\\nfoulest murder, or eat forbidden food, or be guilty of any other horrid\\nact. Love is his tyrant, and lives lordly in him and lawlessly, and\\nbeing himself a king, leads him on, as a tyrant leads a State, to the\\nperformance of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and\\nthe rabble of his associates, whether those whom evil communications\\nhave brought in from without, or those whom he himself has allowed to\\nbreak loose within him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself.\\nHave we not here a picture of his way of life?\\n\\nYes, indeed, he said.\\n\\nAnd if there are only a few of them in the State, and the rest of the\\npeople are well disposed, they go away and become the body-guard or\\nmercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them for\\na war; and if there is no war, they stay at home and do many little\\npieces of mischief in the city.\\n\\nWhat sort of mischief?\\n\\nFor example, they are the thieves, burglars, cut-purses, foot-pads,\\nrobbers of temples, man-stealers of the community; or if they are able\\nto speak they turn informers, and bear false witness, and take bribes.\\n\\nA small catalogue of evils, even if the perpetrators of them are few in\\nnumber.\\n\\nYes, I said; but small and great are comparative terms, and all these\\nthings, in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a State, do not\\ncome within a thousand miles of the tyrant; when this noxious class and\\ntheir followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength,\\nassisted by the infatuation of the people, they choose from among\\nthemselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul, and him\\nthey create their tyrant.\\n\\nYes, he said, and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant.\\n\\nIf the people yield, well and good; but if they resist him, as he began\\nby beating his own father and mother, so now, if he has the power, he\\nbeats them, and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland, as the\\nCretans say, in subjection to his young retainers whom he has\\nintroduced to be their rulers and masters. This is the end of his\\npassions and desires.\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nWhen such men are only private individuals and before they get power,\\nthis is their character; they associate entirely with their own\\nflatterers or ready tools; or if they want anything from anybody, they\\nin their turn are equally ready to bow down before them: they profess\\nevery sort of affection for them; but when they have gained their point\\nthey know them no more.\\n\\nYes, truly.\\n\\nThey are always either the masters or servants and never the friends of\\nanybody; the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship.\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nAnd may we not rightly call such men treacherous?\\n\\nNo question.\\n\\nAlso they are utterly unjust, if we were right in our notion of\\njustice?\\n\\nYes, he said, and we were perfectly right.\\n\\nLet us then sum up in a word, I said, the character of the worst man:\\nhe is the waking reality of what we dreamed.\\n\\nMost true.\\n\\nAnd this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule, and the\\nlonger he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes.\\n\\nThat is certain, said Glaucon, taking his turn to answer.\\n\\nAnd will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest, be also the\\nmost miserable? and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most\\ncontinually and truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion\\nof men in general?\\n\\nYes, he said, inevitably.\\n\\nAnd must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical State, and the\\ndemocratical man like the democratical State; and the same of the\\nothers?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd as State is to State in virtue and happiness, so is man in relation\\nto man?\\n\\nTo be sure.\\n\\nThen comparing our original city, which was under a king, and the city\\nwhich is under a tyrant, how do they stand as to virtue?\\n\\nThey are the opposite extremes, he said, for one is the very best and\\nthe other is the very worst.\\n\\nThere can be no mistake, I said, as to which is which, and therefore I\\nwill at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision\\nabout their relative happiness and misery. And here we must not allow\\nourselves to be panic-stricken at the apparition of the tyrant, who is\\nonly a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him; but let us\\ngo as we ought into every corner of the city and look all about, and\\nthen we will give our opinion.\\n\\nA fair invitation, he replied; and I see, as every one must, that a\\ntyranny is the wretchedest form of government, and the rule of a king\\nthe happiest.\\n\\nAnd in estimating the men too, may I not fairly make a like request,\\nthat I should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through\\nhuman nature? he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and\\nis dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to\\nthe beholder, but let him be one who has a clear insight. May I suppose\\nthat the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able\\nto judge, and has dwelt in the same place with him, and been present at\\nhis dally life and known him in his family relations, where he may be\\nseen stripped of his tragedy attire, and again in the hour of public\\ndanger—he shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant\\nwhen compared with other men?\\n\\nThat again, he said, is a very fair proposal.\\n\\nShall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and\\nhave before now met with such a person? We shall then have some one who\\nwill answer our enquiries.\\n\\nBy all means.\\n\\nLet me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the\\nState; bearing this in mind, and glancing in turn from one to the other\\nof them, will you tell me their respective conditions?\\n\\nWhat do you mean? he asked.\\n\\nBeginning with the State, I replied, would you say that a city which is\\ngoverned by a tyrant is free or enslaved?\\n\\nNo city, he said, can be more completely enslaved.\\n\\nAnd yet, as you see, there are freemen as well as masters in such a\\nState?\\n\\nYes, he said, I see that there are—a few; but the people, speaking\\ngenerally, and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved.\\n\\nThen if the man is like the State, I said, must not the same rule\\nprevail? his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity—the best elements\\nin him are enslaved; and there is a small ruling part, which is also\\nthe worst and maddest.\\n\\nInevitably.\\n\\nAnd would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a\\nfreeman, or of a slave?\\n\\nHe has the soul of a slave, in my opinion.\\n\\nAnd the State which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of\\nacting voluntarily?\\n\\nUtterly incapable.\\n\\nAnd also the soul which is under a tyrant (I am speaking of the soul\\ntaken as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires; there is\\na gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and remorse?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?\\n\\nPoor.\\n\\nAnd the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd must not such a State and such a man be always full of fear?\\n\\nYes, indeed.\\n\\nIs there any State in which you will find more of lamentation and\\nsorrow and groaning and pain?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nAnd is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery\\nthan in the tyrannical man, who is in a fury of passions and desires?\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nReflecting upon these and similar evils, you held the tyrannical State\\nto be the most miserable of States?\\n\\nAnd I was right, he said.\\n\\nCertainly, I said. And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical\\nman, what do you say of him?\\n\\nI say that he is by far the most miserable of all men.\\n\\nThere, I said, I think that you are beginning to go wrong.\\n\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nI do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery.\\n\\nThen who is more miserable?\\n\\nOne of whom I am about to speak.\\n\\nWho is that?\\n\\nHe who is of a tyrannical nature, and instead of leading a private life\\nhas been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant.\\n\\nFrom what has been said, I gather that you are right.\\n\\nYes, I replied, but in this high argument you should be a little more\\ncertain, and should not conjecture only; for of all questions, this\\nrespecting good and evil is the greatest.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nLet me then offer you an illustration, which may, I think, throw a\\nlight upon this subject.\\n\\nWhat is your illustration?\\n\\nThe case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves: from\\nthem you may form an idea of the tyrant’s condition, for they both have\\nslaves; the only difference is that he has more slaves.\\n\\nYes, that is the difference.\\n\\nYou know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from\\ntheir servants?\\n\\nWhat should they fear?\\n\\nNothing. But do you observe the reason of this?\\n\\nYes; the reason is, that the whole city is leagued together for the\\nprotection of each individual.\\n\\nVery true, I said. But imagine one of these owners, the master say of\\nsome fifty slaves, together with his family and property and slaves,\\ncarried off by a god into the wilderness, where there are no freemen to\\nhelp him—will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and\\nchildren should be put to death by his slaves?\\n\\nYes, he said, he will be in the utmost fear.\\n\\nThe time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of his\\nslaves, and make many promises to them of freedom and other things,\\nmuch against his will—he will have to cajole his own servants.\\n\\nYes, he said, that will be the only way of saving himself.\\n\\nAnd suppose the same god, who carried him away, to surround him with\\nneighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another, and\\nwho, if they could catch the offender, would take his life?\\n\\nHis case will be still worse, if you suppose him to be everywhere\\nsurrounded and watched by enemies.\\n\\nAnd is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound—he\\nwho being by nature such as we have described, is full of all sorts of\\nfears and lusts? His soul is dainty and greedy, and yet alone, of all\\nmen in the city, he is never allowed to go on a journey, or to see the\\nthings which other freemen desire to see, but he lives in his hole like\\na woman hidden in the house, and is jealous of any other citizen who\\ngoes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nAnd amid evils such as these will not he who is ill-governed in his own\\nperson—the tyrannical man, I mean—whom you just now decided to be the\\nmost miserable of all—will not he be yet more miserable when, instead\\nof leading a private life, he is constrained by fortune to be a public\\ntyrant? He has to be master of others when he is not master of himself:\\nhe is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his\\nlife, not in retirement, but fighting and combating with other men.\\n\\nYes, he said, the similitude is most exact.\\n\\nIs not his case utterly miserable? and does not the actual tyrant lead\\na worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nHe who is the real tyrant, whatever men may think, is the real slave,\\nand is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility, and to\\nbe the flatterer of the vilest of mankind. He has desires which he is\\nutterly unable to satisfy, and has more wants than any one, and is\\ntruly poor, if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him: all his\\nlife long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions and\\ndistractions, even as the State which he resembles: and surely the\\nresemblance holds?\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nMoreover, as we were saying before, he grows worse from having power:\\nhe becomes and is of necessity more jealous, more faithless, more\\nunjust, more friendless, more impious, than he was at first; he is the\\npurveyor and cherisher of every sort of vice, and the consequence is\\nthat he is supremely miserable, and that he makes everybody else as\\nmiserable as himself.\\n\\nNo man of any sense will dispute your words.\\n\\nCome then, I said, and as the general umpire in theatrical contests\\nproclaims the result, do you also decide who in your opinion is first\\nin the scale of happiness, and who second, and in what order the others\\nfollow: there are five of them in all—they are the royal, timocratical,\\noligarchical, democratical, tyrannical.\\n\\nThe decision will be easily given, he replied; they shall be choruses\\ncoming on the stage, and I must judge them in the order in which they\\nenter, by the criterion of virtue and vice, happiness and misery.\\n\\nNeed we hire a herald, or shall I announce, that the son of Ariston\\n(the best) has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest,\\nand that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself;\\nand that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable, and\\nthat this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the\\ngreatest tyrant of his State?\\n\\nMake the proclamation yourself, he said.\\n\\nAnd shall I add, ‘whether seen or unseen by gods and men’?\\n\\nLet the words be added.\\n\\nThen this, I said, will be our first proof; and there is another, which\\nmay also have some weight.\\n\\nWhat is that?\\n\\nThe second proof is derived from the nature of the soul: seeing that\\nthe individual soul, like the State, has been divided by us into three\\nprinciples, the division may, I think, furnish a new demonstration.\\n\\nOf what nature?\\n\\nIt seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures\\ncorrespond; also three desires and governing powers.\\n\\nHow do you mean? he said.\\n\\nThere is one principle with which, as we were saying, a man learns,\\nanother with which he is angry; the third, having many forms, has no\\nspecial name, but is denoted by the general term appetitive, from the\\nextraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and\\ndrinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of\\nit; also money-loving, because such desires are generally satisfied by\\nthe help of money.\\n\\nThat is true, he said.\\n\\nIf we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were\\nconcerned with gain, we should then be able to fall back on a single\\nnotion; and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul\\nas loving gain or money.\\n\\nI agree with you.\\n\\nAgain, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and\\nconquering and getting fame?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nSuppose we call it the contentious or ambitious—would the term be\\nsuitable?\\n\\nExtremely suitable.\\n\\nOn the other hand, every one sees that the principle of knowledge is\\nwholly directed to the truth, and cares less than either of the others\\nfor gain or fame.\\n\\nFar less.\\n\\n‘Lover of wisdom,’ ‘lover of knowledge,’ are titles which we may fitly\\napply to that part of the soul?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nOne principle prevails in the souls of one class of men, another in\\nothers, as may happen?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThen we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of\\nmen—lovers of wisdom, lovers of honour, lovers of gain?\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nAnd there are three kinds of pleasure, which are their several objects?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nNow, if you examine the three classes of men, and ask of them in turn\\nwhich of their lives is pleasantest, each will be found praising his\\nown and depreciating that of others: the money-maker will contrast the\\nvanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid\\nadvantages of gold and silver?\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nAnd the lover of honour—what will be his opinion? Will he not think\\nthat the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning,\\nif it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to him?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd are we to suppose, I said, that the philosopher sets any value on\\nother pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth,\\nand in that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not so far indeed from the\\nheaven of pleasure? Does he not call the other pleasures necessary,\\nunder the idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would\\nrather not have them?\\n\\nThere can be no doubt of that, he replied.\\n\\nSince, then, the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in\\ndispute, and the question is not which life is more or less honourable,\\nor better or worse, but which is the more pleasant or painless—how\\nshall we know who speaks truly?\\n\\nI cannot myself tell, he said.\\n\\nWell, but what ought to be the criterion? Is any better than experience\\nand wisdom and reason?\\n\\nThere cannot be a better, he said.\\n\\nThen, I said, reflect. Of the three individuals, which has the greatest\\nexperience of all the pleasures which we enumerated? Has the lover of\\ngain, in learning the nature of essential truth, greater experience of\\nthe pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of\\ngain?\\n\\nThe philosopher, he replied, has greatly the advantage; for he has of\\nnecessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his\\nchildhood upwards: but the lover of gain in all his experience has not\\nof necessity tasted—or, I should rather say, even had he desired, could\\nhardly have tasted—the sweetness of learning and knowing truth.\\n\\nThen the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain,\\nfor he has a double experience?\\n\\nYes, very great.\\n\\nAgain, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the\\nlover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?\\n\\nNay, he said, all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their\\nobject; for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have\\ntheir crowd of admirers, and as they all receive honour they all have\\nexperience of the pleasures of honour; but the delight which is to be\\nfound in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only.\\n\\nHis experience, then, will enable him to judge better than any one?\\n\\nFar better.\\n\\nAnd he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nFurther, the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not\\npossessed by the covetous or ambitious man, but only by the\\nphilosopher?\\n\\nWhat faculty?\\n\\nReason, with whom, as we were saying, the decision ought to rest.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nIf wealth and gain were the criterion, then the praise or blame of the\\nlover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy?\\n\\nAssuredly.\\n\\nOr if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgment of the\\nambitious or pugnacious would be the truest?\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nBut since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges—\\n\\nThe only inference possible, he replied, is that pleasures which are\\napproved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest.\\n\\nAnd so we arrive at the result, that the pleasure of the intelligent\\npart of the soul is the pleasantest of the three, and that he of us in\\nwhom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life.\\n\\nUnquestionably, he said, the wise man speaks with authority when he\\napproves of his own life.\\n\\nAnd what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the\\npleasure which is next?\\n\\nClearly that of the soldier and lover of honour; who is nearer to\\nhimself than the money-maker.\\n\\nLast comes the lover of gain?\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nTwice in succession, then, has the just man overthrown the unjust in\\nthis conflict; and now comes the third trial, which is dedicated to\\nOlympian Zeus the saviour: a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure\\nexcept that of the wise is quite true and pure—all others are a shadow\\nonly; and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of\\nfalls?\\n\\nYes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself?\\n\\nI will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions.\\n\\nProceed.\\n\\nSay, then, is not pleasure opposed to pain?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain?\\n\\nThere is.\\n\\nA state which is intermediate, and a sort of repose of the soul about\\neither—that is what you mean?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nYou remember what people say when they are sick?\\n\\nWhat do they say?\\n\\nThat after all nothing is pleasanter than health. But then they never\\nknew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill.\\n\\nYes, I know, he said.\\n\\nAnd when persons are suffering from acute pain, you must have heard\\nthem say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their\\npain?\\n\\nI have.\\n\\nAnd there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and\\ncessation of pain, and not any positive enjoyment, is extolled by them\\nas the greatest pleasure?\\n\\nYes, he said; at the time they are pleased and well content to be at\\nrest.\\n\\nAgain, when pleasure ceases, that sort of rest or cessation will be\\npainful?\\n\\nDoubtless, he said.\\n\\nThen the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be\\npain?\\n\\nSo it would seem.\\n\\nBut can that which is neither become both?\\n\\nI should say not.\\n\\nAnd both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul, are they not?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nBut that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion,\\nand in a mean between them?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nHow, then, can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is\\npleasure, or that the absence of pleasure is pain?\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nThis then is an appearance only and not a reality; that is to say, the\\nrest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful,\\nand painful in comparison of what is pleasant; but all these\\nrepresentations, when tried by the test of true pleasure, are not real\\nbut a sort of imposition?\\n\\nThat is the inference.\\n\\nLook at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains and\\nyou will no longer suppose, as you perhaps may at present, that\\npleasure is only the cessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.\\n\\nWhat are they, he said, and where shall I find them?\\n\\nThere are many of them: take as an example the pleasures of smell,\\nwhich are very great and have no antecedent pains; they come in a\\nmoment, and when they depart leave no pain behind them.\\n\\nMost true, he said.\\n\\nLet us not, then, be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the\\ncessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nStill, the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul\\nthrough the body are generally of this sort—they are reliefs of pain.\\n\\nThat is true.\\n\\nAnd the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like\\nnature?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nShall I give you an illustration of them?\\n\\nLet me hear.\\n\\nYou would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower and\\nmiddle region?\\n\\nI should.\\n\\nAnd if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region, would\\nhe not imagine that he is going up; and he who is standing in the\\nmiddle and sees whence he has come, would imagine that he is already in\\nthe upper region, if he has never seen the true upper world?\\n\\nTo be sure, he said; how can he think otherwise?\\n\\nBut if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine,\\nthat he was descending?\\n\\nNo doubt.\\n\\nAll that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle\\nand lower regions?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThen can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth, as\\nthey have wrong ideas about many other things, should also have wrong\\nideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state; so that when\\nthey are only being drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think\\nthe pain which they experience to be real, and in like manner, when\\ndrawn away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state, they firmly\\nbelieve that they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure; they,\\nnot knowing pleasure, err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain,\\nwhich is like contrasting black with grey instead of white—can you\\nwonder, I say, at this?\\n\\nNo, indeed; I should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite.\\n\\nLook at the matter thus:—Hunger, thirst, and the like, are inanitions\\nof the bodily state?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that\\nwhich has more existence the truer?\\n\\nClearly, from that which has more.\\n\\nWhat classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your\\njudgment—those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of\\nsustenance are examples, or the class which contains true opinion and\\nknowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue? Put the\\nquestion in this way:—Which has a more pure being—that which is\\nconcerned with the invariable, the immortal, and the true, and is of\\nsuch a nature, and is found in such natures; or that which is concerned\\nwith and found in the variable and mortal, and is itself variable and\\nmortal?\\n\\nFar purer, he replied, is the being of that which is concerned with the\\ninvariable.\\n\\nAnd does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same\\ndegree as of essence?\\n\\nYes, of knowledge in the same degree.\\n\\nAnd of truth in the same degree?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of\\nessence?\\n\\nNecessarily.\\n\\nThen, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service of the\\nbody have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service\\nof the soul?\\n\\nFar less.\\n\\nAnd has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nWhat is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real\\nexistence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less\\nreal existence and is less real?\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nAnd if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according\\nto nature, that which is more really filled with more real being will\\nmore really and truly enjoy true pleasure; whereas that which\\nparticipates in less real being will be less truly and surely\\nsatisfied, and will participate in an illusory and less real pleasure?\\n\\nUnquestionably.\\n\\nThose then who know not wisdom and virtue, and are always busy with\\ngluttony and sensuality, go down and up again as far as the mean; and\\nin this region they move at random throughout life, but they never pass\\ninto the true upper world; thither they neither look, nor do they ever\\nfind their way, neither are they truly filled with true being, nor do\\nthey taste of pure and abiding pleasure. Like cattle, with their eyes\\nalways looking down and their heads stooping to the earth, that is, to\\nthe dining-table, they fatten and feed and breed, and, in their\\nexcessive love of these delights, they kick and butt at one another\\nwith horns and hoofs which are made of iron; and they kill one another\\nby reason of their insatiable lust. For they fill themselves with that\\nwhich is not substantial, and the part of themselves which they fill is\\nalso unsubstantial and incontinent.\\n\\nVerily, Socrates, said Glaucon, you describe the life of the many like\\nan oracle.\\n\\nTheir pleasures are mixed with pains—how can they be otherwise? For\\nthey are mere shadows and pictures of the true, and are coloured by\\ncontrast, which exaggerates both light and shade, and so they implant\\nin the minds of fools insane desires of themselves; and they are fought\\nabout as Stesichorus says that the Greeks fought about the shadow of\\nHelen at Troy in ignorance of the truth.\\n\\nSomething of that sort must inevitably happen.\\n\\nAnd must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of\\nthe soul? Will not the passionate man who carries his passion into\\naction, be in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious, or\\nviolent and contentious, or angry and discontented, if he be seeking to\\nattain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without\\nreason or sense?\\n\\nYes, he said, the same will happen with the spirited element also.\\n\\nThen may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour,\\nwhen they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of\\nreason and knowledge, and pursue after and win the pleasures which\\nwisdom shows them, will also have the truest pleasures in the highest\\ndegree which is attainable to them, inasmuch as they follow truth; and\\nthey will have the pleasures which are natural to them, if that which\\nis best for each one is also most natural to him?\\n\\nYes, certainly; the best is the most natural.\\n\\nAnd when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle, and there\\nis no division, the several parts are just, and do each of them their\\nown business, and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of\\nwhich they are capable?\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nBut when either of the two other principles prevails, it fails in\\nattaining its own pleasure, and compels the rest to pursue after a\\npleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and\\nreason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance\\nfrom law and order?\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nAnd the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest\\ndistance? Yes.\\n\\nAnd the royal and orderly desires are nearest?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThen the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural\\npleasure, and the king at the least?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nBut if so, the tyrant will live most unpleasantly, and the king most\\npleasantly?\\n\\nInevitably.\\n\\nWould you know the measure of the interval which separates them?\\n\\nWill you tell me?\\n\\nThere appear to be three pleasures, one genuine and two spurious: now\\nthe transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious; he\\nhas run away from the region of law and reason, and taken up his abode\\nwith certain slave pleasures which are his satellites, and the measure\\nof his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure.\\n\\nHow do you mean?\\n\\nI assume, I said, that the tyrant is in the third place from the\\noligarch; the democrat was in the middle?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an\\nimage of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure\\nof the oligarch?\\n\\nHe will.\\n\\nAnd the oligarch is third from the royal; since we count as one royal\\nand aristocratical?\\n\\nYes, he is third.\\n\\nThen the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number\\nwhich is three times three?\\n\\nManifestly.\\n\\nThe shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of\\nlength will be a plane figure.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd if you raise the power and make the plane a solid, there is no\\ndifficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is\\nparted from the king.\\n\\nYes; the arithmetician will easily do the sum.\\n\\nOr if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval by\\nwhich the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure, he will\\nfind him, when the multiplication is completed, living 729 times more\\npleasantly, and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval.\\n\\nWhat a wonderful calculation! And how enormous is the distance which\\nseparates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain!\\n\\nYet a true calculation, I said, and a number which nearly concerns\\nhuman life, if human beings are concerned with days and nights and\\nmonths and years. (729 NEARLY equals the number of days and nights in\\nthe year.)\\n\\nYes, he said, human life is certainly concerned with them.\\n\\nThen if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil\\nand unjust, his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of\\nlife and in beauty and virtue?\\n\\nImmeasurably greater.\\n\\nWell, I said, and now having arrived at this stage of the argument, we\\nmay revert to the words which brought us hither: Was not some one\\nsaying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was\\nreputed to be just?\\n\\nYes, that was said.\\n\\nNow then, having determined the power and quality of justice and\\ninjustice, let us have a little conversation with him.\\n\\nWhat shall we say to him?\\n\\nLet us make an image of the soul, that he may have his own words\\npresented before his eyes.\\n\\nOf what sort?\\n\\nAn ideal image of the soul, like the composite creations of ancient\\nmythology, such as the Chimera or Scylla or Cerberus, and there are\\nmany others in which two or more different natures are said to grow\\ninto one.\\n\\nThere are said of have been such unions.\\n\\nThen do you now model the form of a multitudinous, many-headed monster,\\nhaving a ring of heads of all manner of beasts, tame and wild, which he\\nis able to generate and metamorphose at will.\\n\\nYou suppose marvellous powers in the artist; but, as language is more\\npliable than wax or any similar substance, let there be such a model as\\nyou propose.\\n\\nSuppose now that you make a second form as of a lion, and a third of a\\nman, the second smaller than the first, and the third smaller than the\\nsecond.\\n\\nThat, he said, is an easier task; and I have made them as you say.\\n\\nAnd now join them, and let the three grow into one.\\n\\nThat has been accomplished.\\n\\nNext fashion the outside of them into a single image, as of a man, so\\nthat he who is not able to look within, and sees only the outer hull,\\nmay believe the beast to be a single human creature.\\n\\nI have done so, he said.\\n\\nAnd now, to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human\\ncreature to be unjust, and unprofitable to be just, let us reply that,\\nif he be right, it is profitable for this creature to feast the\\nmultitudinous monster and strengthen the lion and the lion-like\\nqualities, but to starve and weaken the man, who is consequently liable\\nto be dragged about at the mercy of either of the other two; and he is\\nnot to attempt to familiarize or harmonize them with one another—he\\nought rather to suffer them to fight and bite and devour one another.\\n\\nCertainly, he said; that is what the approver of injustice says.\\n\\nTo him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so\\nspeak and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the\\nmost complete mastery over the entire human creature. He should watch\\nover the many-headed monster like a good husbandman, fostering and\\ncultivating the gentle qualities, and preventing the wild ones from\\ngrowing; he should be making the lion-heart his ally, and in common\\ncare of them all should be uniting the several parts with one another\\nand with himself.\\n\\nYes, he said, that is quite what the maintainer of justice say.\\n\\nAnd so from every point of view, whether of pleasure, honour, or\\nadvantage, the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth, and\\nthe disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant?\\n\\nYes, from every point of view.\\n\\nCome, now, and let us gently reason with the unjust, who is not\\nintentionally in error. ‘Sweet Sir,’ we will say to him, ‘what think\\nyou of things esteemed noble and ignoble? Is not the noble that which\\nsubjects the beast to the man, or rather to the god in man; and the\\nignoble that which subjects the man to the beast?’ He can hardly avoid\\nsaying Yes—can he now?\\n\\nNot if he has any regard for my opinion.\\n\\nBut, if he agree so far, we may ask him to answer another question:\\n‘Then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the\\ncondition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst?\\nWho can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery\\nfor money, especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil\\nmen, would be the gainer, however large might be the sum which he\\nreceived? And will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff who\\nremorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most godless\\nand detestable? Eriphyle took the necklace as the price of her\\nhusband’s life, but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a worse\\nruin.’\\n\\nYes, said Glaucon, far worse—I will answer for him.\\n\\nHas not the intemperate been censured of old, because in him the huge\\nmultiform monster is allowed to be too much at large?\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nAnd men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent\\nelement in them disproportionately grows and gains strength?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd luxury and softness are blamed, because they relax and weaken this\\nsame creature, and make a coward of him?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates\\nthe spirited animal to the unruly monster, and, for the sake of money,\\nof which he can never have enough, habituates him in the days of his\\nyouth to be trampled in the mire, and from being a lion to become a\\nmonkey?\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nAnd why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach? Only because\\nthey imply a natural weakness of the higher principle; the individual\\nis unable to control the creatures within him, but has to court them,\\nand his great study is how to flatter them.\\n\\nSuch appears to be the reason.\\n\\nAnd therefore, being desirous of placing him under a rule like that of\\nthe best, we say that he ought to be the servant of the best, in whom\\nthe Divine rules; not, as Thrasymachus supposed, to the injury of the\\nservant, but because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom\\ndwelling within him; or, if this be impossible, then by an external\\nauthority, in order that we may be all, as far as possible, under the\\nsame government, friends and equals.\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\n\\nAnd this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law, which is the\\nally of the whole city; and is seen also in the authority which we\\nexercise over children, and the refusal to let them be free until we\\nhave established in them a principle analogous to the constitution of a\\nstate, and by cultivation of this higher element have set up in their\\nhearts a guardian and ruler like our own, and when this is done they\\nmay go their ways.\\n\\nYes, he said, the purpose of the law is manifest.\\n\\nFrom what point of view, then, and on what ground can we say that a man\\nis profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness, which will\\nmake him a worse man, even though he acquire money or power by his\\nwickedness?\\n\\nFrom no point of view at all.\\n\\nWhat shall he profit, if his injustice be undetected and unpunished? He\\nwho is undetected only gets worse, whereas he who is detected and\\npunished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized; the\\ngentler element in him is liberated, and his whole soul is perfected\\nand ennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom,\\nmore than the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty, strength and\\nhealth, in proportion as the soul is more honourable than the body.\\n\\nCertainly, he said.\\n\\nTo this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the\\nenergies of his life. And in the first place, he will honour studies\\nwhich impress these qualities on his soul and will disregard others?\\n\\nClearly, he said.\\n\\nIn the next place, he will regulate his bodily habit and training, and\\nso far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures,\\nthat he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter; his first\\nobject will be not that he may be fair or strong or well, unless he is\\nlikely thereby to gain temperance, but he will always desire so to\\nattemper the body as to preserve the harmony of the soul?\\n\\nCertainly he will, if he has true music in him.\\n\\nAnd in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and\\nharmony which he will also observe; he will not allow himself to be\\ndazzled by the foolish applause of the world, and heap up riches to his\\nown infinite harm?\\n\\nCertainly not, he said.\\n\\nHe will look at the city which is within him, and take heed that no\\ndisorder occur in it, such as might arise either from superfluity or\\nfrom want; and upon this principle he will regulate his property and\\ngain or spend according to his means.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd, for the same reason, he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours\\nas he deems likely to make him a better man; but those, whether private\\nor public, which are likely to disorder his life, he will avoid?\\n\\nThen, if that is his motive, he will not be a statesman.\\n\\nBy the dog of Egypt, he will! in the city which is his own he certainly\\nwill, though in the land of his birth perhaps not, unless he have a\\ndivine call.\\n\\nI understand; you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we\\nare the founders, and which exists in idea only; for I do not believe\\nthat there is such an one anywhere on earth?\\n\\nIn heaven, I replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks, which\\nhe who desires may behold, and beholding, may set his own house in\\norder. But whether such an one exists, or ever will exist in fact, is\\nno matter; for he will live after the manner of that city, having\\nnothing to do with any other.\\n\\nI think so, he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n BOOK X.\\n\\n\\nOf the many excellences which I perceive in the order of our State,\\nthere is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule\\nabout poetry.\\n\\nTo what do you refer?\\n\\nTo the rejection of imitative poetry, which certainly ought not to be\\nreceived; as I see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have\\nbeen distinguished.\\n\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nSpeaking in confidence, for I should not like to have my words repeated\\nto the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe—but I do not mind\\nsaying to you, that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the\\nunderstanding of the hearers, and that the knowledge of their true\\nnature is the only antidote to them.\\n\\nExplain the purport of your remark.\\n\\nWell, I will tell you, although I have always from my earliest youth\\nhad an awe and love of Homer, which even now makes the words falter on\\nmy lips, for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that\\ncharming tragic company; but a man is not to be reverenced more than\\nthe truth, and therefore I will speak out.\\n\\nVery good, he said.\\n\\nListen to me then, or rather, answer me.\\n\\nPut your question.\\n\\nCan you tell me what imitation is? for I really do not know.\\n\\nA likely thing, then, that I should know.\\n\\nWhy not? for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the\\nkeener.\\n\\nVery true, he said; but in your presence, even if I had any faint\\nnotion, I could not muster courage to utter it. Will you enquire\\nyourself?\\n\\nWell then, shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner: Whenever a\\nnumber of individuals have a common name, we assume them to have also a\\ncorresponding idea or form:—do you understand me?\\n\\nI do.\\n\\nLet us take any common instance; there are beds and tables in the\\nworld—plenty of them, are there not?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nBut there are only two ideas or forms of them—one the idea of a bed,\\nthe other of a table.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our\\nuse, in accordance with the idea—that is our way of speaking in this\\nand similar instances—but no artificer makes the ideas themselves: how\\ncould he?\\n\\nImpossible.\\n\\nAnd there is another artist,—I should like to know what you would say\\nof him.\\n\\nWho is he?\\n\\nOne who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen.\\n\\nWhat an extraordinary man!\\n\\nWait a little, and there will be more reason for your saying so. For\\nthis is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind, but\\nplants and animals, himself and all other things—the earth and heaven,\\nand the things which are in heaven or under the earth; he makes the\\ngods also.\\n\\nHe must be a wizard and no mistake.\\n\\nOh! you are incredulous, are you? Do you mean that there is no such\\nmaker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all\\nthese things but in another not? Do you see that there is a way in\\nwhich you could make them all yourself?\\n\\nWhat way?\\n\\nAn easy way enough; or rather, there are many ways in which the feat\\nmight be quickly and easily accomplished, none quicker than that of\\nturning a mirror round and round—you would soon enough make the sun and\\nthe heavens, and the earth and yourself, and other animals and plants,\\nand all the other things of which we were just now speaking, in the\\nmirror.\\n\\nYes, he said; but they would be appearances only.\\n\\nVery good, I said, you are coming to the point now. And the painter too\\nis, as I conceive, just such another—a creator of appearances, is he\\nnot?\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nBut then I suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue. And yet\\nthere is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed?\\n\\nYes, he said, but not a real bed.\\n\\nAnd what of the maker of the bed? were you not saying that he too\\nmakes, not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the\\nbed, but only a particular bed?\\n\\nYes, I did.\\n\\nThen if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true\\nexistence, but only some semblance of existence; and if any one were to\\nsay that the work of the maker of the bed, or of any other workman, has\\nreal existence, he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth.\\n\\nAt any rate, he replied, philosophers would say that he was not\\nspeaking the truth.\\n\\nNo wonder, then, that his work too is an indistinct expression of\\ntruth.\\n\\nNo wonder.\\n\\nSuppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire\\nwho this imitator is?\\n\\nIf you please.\\n\\nWell then, here are three beds: one existing in nature, which is made\\nby God, as I think that we may say—for no one else can be the maker?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nThere is another which is the work of the carpenter?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd the work of the painter is a third?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nBeds, then, are of three kinds, and there are three artists who\\nsuperintend them: God, the maker of the bed, and the painter?\\n\\nYes, there are three of them.\\n\\nGod, whether from choice or from necessity, made one bed in nature and\\none only; two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever\\nwill be made by God.\\n\\nWhy is that?\\n\\nBecause even if He had made but two, a third would still appear behind\\nthem which both of them would have for their idea, and that would be\\nthe ideal bed and not the two others.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nGod knew this, and He desired to be the real maker of a real bed, not a\\nparticular maker of a particular bed, and therefore He created a bed\\nwhich is essentially and by nature one only.\\n\\nSo we believe.\\n\\nShall we, then, speak of Him as the natural author or maker of the bed?\\n\\nYes, he replied; inasmuch as by the natural process of creation He is\\nthe author of this and of all other things.\\n\\nAnd what shall we say of the carpenter—is not he also the maker of the\\nbed?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nBut would you call the painter a creator and maker?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nYet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?\\n\\nI think, he said, that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of\\nthat which the others make.\\n\\nGood, I said; then you call him who is third in the descent from nature\\nan imitator?\\n\\nCertainly, he said.\\n\\nAnd the tragic poet is an imitator, and therefore, like all other\\nimitators, he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth?\\n\\nThat appears to be so.\\n\\nThen about the imitator we are agreed. And what about the painter?—I\\nwould like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which\\noriginally exists in nature, or only the creations of artists?\\n\\nThe latter.\\n\\nAs they are or as they appear? you have still to determine this.\\n\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nI mean, that you may look at a bed from different points of view,\\nobliquely or directly or from any other point of view, and the bed will\\nappear different, but there is no difference in reality. And the same\\nof all things.\\n\\nYes, he said, the difference is only apparent.\\n\\nNow let me ask you another question: Which is the art of painting\\ndesigned to be—an imitation of things as they are, or as they appear—of\\nappearance or of reality?\\n\\nOf appearance.\\n\\nThen the imitator, I said, is a long way off the truth, and can do all\\nthings because he lightly touches on a small part of them, and that\\npart an image. For example: A painter will paint a cobbler, carpenter,\\nor any other artist, though he knows nothing of their arts; and, if he\\nis a good artist, he may deceive children or simple persons, when he\\nshows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance, and they will\\nfancy that they are looking at a real carpenter.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all\\nthe arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single\\nthing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man—whoever tells\\nus this, I think that we can only imagine him to be a simple creature\\nwho is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he\\nmet, and whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to\\nanalyse the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation.\\n\\nMost true.\\n\\nAnd so, when we hear persons saying that the tragedians, and Homer, who\\nis at their head, know all the arts and all things human, virtue as\\nwell as vice, and divine things too, for that the good poet cannot\\ncompose well unless he knows his subject, and that he who has not this\\nknowledge can never be a poet, we ought to consider whether here also\\nthere may not be a similar illusion. Perhaps they may have come across\\nimitators and been deceived by them; they may not have remembered when\\nthey saw their works that these were but imitations thrice removed from\\nthe truth, and could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth,\\nbecause they are appearances only and not realities? Or, after all,\\nthey may be in the right, and poets do really know the things about\\nwhich they seem to the many to speak so well?\\n\\nThe question, he said, should by all means be considered.\\n\\nNow do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as\\nwell as the image, he would seriously devote himself to the\\nimage-making branch? Would he allow imitation to be the ruling\\nprinciple of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?\\n\\nI should say not.\\n\\nThe real artist, who knew what he was imitating, would be interested in\\nrealities and not in imitations; and would desire to leave as memorials\\nof himself works many and fair; and, instead of being the author of\\nencomiums, he would prefer to be the theme of them.\\n\\nYes, he said, that would be to him a source of much greater honour and\\nprofit.\\n\\nThen, I said, we must put a question to Homer; not about medicine, or\\nany of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer: we are not\\ngoing to ask him, or any other poet, whether he has cured patients like\\nAsclepius, or left behind him a school of medicine such as the\\nAsclepiads were, or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts\\nat second-hand; but we have a right to know respecting military\\ntactics, politics, education, which are the chiefest and noblest\\nsubjects of his poems, and we may fairly ask him about them. ‘Friend\\nHomer,’ then we say to him, ‘if you are only in the second remove from\\ntruth in what you say of virtue, and not in the third—not an image\\nmaker or imitator—and if you are able to discern what pursuits make men\\nbetter or worse in private or public life, tell us what State was ever\\nbetter governed by your help? The good order of Lacedaemon is due to\\nLycurgus, and many other cities great and small have been similarly\\nbenefited by others; but who says that you have been a good legislator\\nto them and have done them any good? Italy and Sicily boast of\\nCharondas, and there is Solon who is renowned among us; but what city\\nhas anything to say about you?’ Is there any city which he might name?\\n\\nI think not, said Glaucon; not even the Homerids themselves pretend\\nthat he was a legislator.\\n\\nWell, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully\\nby him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?\\n\\nThere is not.\\n\\nOr is there any invention of his, applicable to the arts or to human\\nlife, such as Thales the Milesian or Anacharsis the Scythian, and other\\ningenious men have conceived, which is attributed to him?\\n\\nThere is absolutely nothing of the kind.\\n\\nBut, if Homer never did any public service, was he privately a guide or\\nteacher of any? Had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate\\nwith him, and who handed down to posterity an Homeric way of life, such\\nas was established by Pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his\\nwisdom, and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the\\norder which was named after him?\\n\\nNothing of the kind is recorded of him. For surely, Socrates,\\nCreophylus, the companion of Homer, that child of flesh, whose name\\nalways makes us laugh, might be more justly ridiculed for his\\nstupidity, if, as is said, Homer was greatly neglected by him and\\nothers in his own day when he was alive?\\n\\nYes, I replied, that is the tradition. But can you imagine, Glaucon,\\nthat if Homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind—if he\\nhad possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator—can you imagine, I\\nsay, that he would not have had many followers, and been honoured and\\nloved by them? Protagoras of Abdera, and Prodicus of Ceos, and a host\\nof others, have only to whisper to their contemporaries: ‘You will\\nnever be able to manage either your own house or your own State until\\nyou appoint us to be your ministers of education’—and this ingenious\\ndevice of theirs has such an effect in making men love them that their\\ncompanions all but carry them about on their shoulders. And is it\\nconceivable that the contemporaries of Homer, or again of Hesiod, would\\nhave allowed either of them to go about as rhapsodists, if they had\\nreally been able to make mankind virtuous? Would they not have been as\\nunwilling to part with them as with gold, and have compelled them to\\nstay at home with them? Or, if the master would not stay, then the\\ndisciples would have followed him about everywhere, until they had got\\neducation enough?\\n\\nYes, Socrates, that, I think, is quite true.\\n\\nThen must we not infer that all these poetical individuals, beginning\\nwith Homer, are only imitators; they copy images of virtue and the\\nlike, but the truth they never reach? The poet is like a painter who,\\nas we have already observed, will make a likeness of a cobbler though\\nhe understands nothing of cobbling; and his picture is good enough for\\nthose who know no more than he does, and judge only by colours and\\nfigures.\\n\\nQuite so.\\n\\nIn like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to lay\\non the colours of the several arts, himself understanding their nature\\nonly enough to imitate them; and other people, who are as ignorant as\\nhe is, and judge only from his words, imagine that if he speaks of\\ncobbling, or of military tactics, or of anything else, in metre and\\nharmony and rhythm, he speaks very well—such is the sweet influence\\nwhich melody and rhythm by nature have. And I think that you must have\\nobserved again and again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make\\nwhen stripped of the colours which music puts upon them, and recited in\\nsimple prose.\\n\\nYes, he said.\\n\\nThey are like faces which were never really beautiful, but only\\nblooming; and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them?\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nHere is another point: The imitator or maker of the image knows nothing\\nof true existence; he knows appearances only. Am I not right?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nThen let us have a clear understanding, and not be satisfied with half\\nan explanation.\\n\\nProceed.\\n\\nOf the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a\\nbit?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd the worker in leather and brass will make them?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nBut does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins? Nay,\\nhardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the\\nhorseman who knows how to use them—he knows their right form.\\n\\nMost true.\\n\\nAnd may we not say the same of all things?\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nThat there are three arts which are concerned with all things: one\\nwhich uses, another which makes, a third which imitates them?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure, animate or\\ninanimate, and of every action of man, is relative to the use for which\\nnature or the artist has intended them.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThen the user of them must have the greatest experience of them, and he\\nmust indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop\\nthemselves in use; for example, the flute-player will tell the\\nflute-maker which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer; he\\nwill tell him how he ought to make them, and the other will attend to\\nhis instructions?\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nThe one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness\\nand badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do what\\nhe is told by him?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThe instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of it\\nthe maker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will gain\\nfrom him who knows, by talking to him and being compelled to hear what\\nhe has to say, whereas the user will have knowledge?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nBut will the imitator have either? Will he know from use whether or no\\nhis drawing is correct or beautiful? or will he have right opinion from\\nbeing compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him\\ninstructions about what he should draw?\\n\\nNeither.\\n\\nThen he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge\\nabout the goodness or badness of his imitations?\\n\\nI suppose not.\\n\\nThe imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about\\nhis own creations?\\n\\nNay, very much the reverse.\\n\\nAnd still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing\\ngood or bad, and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which\\nappears to be good to the ignorant multitude?\\n\\nJust so.\\n\\nThus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no\\nknowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates. Imitation is only a\\nkind of play or sport, and the tragic poets, whether they write in\\nIambic or in Heroic verse, are imitators in the highest degree?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd now tell me, I conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us to\\nbe concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?\\n\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nI will explain: The body which is large when seen near, appears small\\nwhen seen at a distance?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water,\\nand crooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing to\\nthe illusion about colours to which the sight is liable. Thus every\\nsort of confusion is revealed within us; and this is that weakness of\\nthe human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light\\nand shadow and other ingenious devices imposes, having an effect upon\\nus like magic.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue\\nof the human understanding—there is the beauty of them—and the apparent\\ngreater or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery over\\nus, but give way before calculation and measure and weight?\\n\\nMost true.\\n\\nAnd this, surely, must be the work of the calculating and rational\\nprinciple in the soul?\\n\\nTo be sure.\\n\\nAnd when this principle measures and certifies that some things are\\nequal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an\\napparent contradiction?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nBut were we not saying that such a contradiction is impossible—the same\\nfaculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same\\nthing?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nThen that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is\\nnot the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to\\nmeasure and calculation?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of\\nthe soul?\\n\\nNo doubt.\\n\\nThis was the conclusion at which I was seeking to arrive when I said\\nthat painting or drawing, and imitation in general, when doing their\\nown proper work, are far removed from truth, and the companions and\\nfriends and associates of a principle within us which is equally\\nremoved from reason, and that they have no true or healthy aim.\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nThe imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior, and has\\ninferior offspring.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the\\nhearing also, relating in fact to what we term poetry?\\n\\nProbably the same would be true of poetry.\\n\\nDo not rely, I said, on a probability derived from the analogy of\\npainting; but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with\\nwhich poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad.\\n\\nBy all means.\\n\\nWe may state the question thus:—Imitation imitates the actions of men,\\nwhether voluntary or involuntary, on which, as they imagine, a good or\\nbad result has ensued, and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly. Is there\\nanything more?\\n\\nNo, there is nothing else.\\n\\nBut in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with\\nhimself—or rather, as in the instance of sight there was confusion and\\nopposition in his opinions about the same things, so here also is there\\nnot strife and inconsistency in his life? Though I need hardly raise\\nthe question again, for I remember that all this has been already\\nadmitted; and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these\\nand ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment?\\n\\nAnd we were right, he said.\\n\\nYes, I said, thus far we were right; but there was an omission which\\nmust now be supplied.\\n\\nWhat was the omission?\\n\\nWere we not saying that a good man, who has the misfortune to lose his\\nson or anything else which is most dear to him, will bear the loss with\\nmore equanimity than another?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nBut will he have no sorrow, or shall we say that although he cannot\\nhelp sorrowing, he will moderate his sorrow?\\n\\nThe latter, he said, is the truer statement.\\n\\nTell me: will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his\\nsorrow when he is seen by his equals, or when he is alone?\\n\\nIt will make a great difference whether he is seen or not.\\n\\nWhen he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things\\nwhich he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThere is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist, as\\nwell as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his\\nsorrow?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nBut when a man is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from the\\nsame object, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct\\nprinciples in him?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nOne of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law?\\n\\nHow do you mean?\\n\\nThe law would say that to be patient under suffering is best, and that\\nwe should not give way to impatience, as there is no knowing whether\\nsuch things are good or evil; and nothing is gained by impatience;\\nalso, because no human thing is of serious importance, and grief stands\\nin the way of that which at the moment is most required.\\n\\nWhat is most required? he asked.\\n\\nThat we should take counsel about what has happened, and when the dice\\nhave been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best;\\nnot, like children who have had a fall, keeping hold of the part struck\\nand wasting time in setting up a howl, but always accustoming the soul\\nforthwith to apply a remedy, raising up that which is sickly and\\nfallen, banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art.\\n\\nYes, he said, that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune.\\n\\nYes, I said; and the higher principle is ready to follow this\\nsuggestion of reason?\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nAnd the other principle, which inclines us to recollection of our\\ntroubles and to lamentation, and can never have enough of them, we may\\ncall irrational, useless, and cowardly?\\n\\nIndeed, we may.\\n\\nAnd does not the latter—I mean the rebellious principle—furnish a great\\nvariety of materials for imitation? Whereas the wise and calm\\ntemperament, being always nearly equable, is not easy to imitate or to\\nappreciate when imitated, especially at a public festival when a\\npromiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre. For the feeling\\nrepresented is one to which they are strangers.\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThen the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature\\nmade, nor is his art intended, to please or to affect the rational\\nprinciple in the soul; but he will prefer the passionate and fitful\\ntemper, which is easily imitated?\\n\\nClearly.\\n\\nAnd now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the\\npainter, for he is like him in two ways: first, inasmuch as his\\ncreations have an inferior degree of truth—in this, I say, he is like\\nhim; and he is also like him in being concerned with an inferior part\\nof the soul; and therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him\\ninto a well-ordered State, because he awakens and nourishes and\\nstrengthens the feelings and impairs the reason. As in a city when the\\nevil are permitted to have authority and the good are put out of the\\nway, so in the soul of man, as we maintain, the imitative poet implants\\nan evil constitution, for he indulges the irrational nature which has\\nno discernment of greater and less, but thinks the same thing at one\\ntime great and at another small—he is a manufacturer of images and is\\nvery far removed from the truth.\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nBut we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our\\naccusation:—the power which poetry has of harming even the good (and\\nthere are very few who are not harmed), is surely an awful thing?\\n\\nYes, certainly, if the effect is what you say.\\n\\nHear and judge: The best of us, as I conceive, when we listen to a\\npassage of Homer, or one of the tragedians, in which he represents some\\npitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration, or\\nweeping, and smiting his breast—the best of us, you know, delight in\\ngiving way to sympathy, and are in raptures at the excellence of the\\npoet who stirs our feelings most.\\n\\nYes, of course I know.\\n\\nBut when any sorrow of our own happens to us, then you may observe that\\nwe pride ourselves on the opposite quality—we would fain be quiet and\\npatient; this is the manly part, and the other which delighted us in\\nthe recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\n\\nNow can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that\\nwhich any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own\\nperson?\\n\\nNo, he said, that is certainly not reasonable.\\n\\nNay, I said, quite reasonable from one point of view.\\n\\nWhat point of view?\\n\\nIf you consider, I said, that when in misfortune we feel a natural\\nhunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation, and\\nthat this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is\\nsatisfied and delighted by the poets;—the better nature in each of us,\\nnot having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit, allows the\\nsympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is another’s; and\\nthe spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in\\npraising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good man he\\nis, and making a fuss about his troubles; he thinks that the pleasure\\nis a gain, and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem\\ntoo? Few persons ever reflect, as I should imagine, that from the evil\\nof other men something of evil is communicated to themselves. And so\\nthe feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the\\nmisfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own.\\n\\nHow very true!\\n\\nAnd does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? There are jests\\nwhich you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic\\nstage, or indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused\\nby them, and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness;—the case\\nof pity is repeated;—there is a principle in human nature which is\\ndisposed to raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by\\nreason, because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let\\nout again; and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre,\\nyou are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet\\nat home.\\n\\nQuite true, he said.\\n\\nAnd the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other\\naffections, of desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be\\ninseparable from every action—in all of them poetry feeds and waters\\nthe passions instead of drying them up; she lets them rule, although\\nthey ought to be controlled, if mankind are ever to increase in\\nhappiness and virtue.\\n\\nI cannot deny it.\\n\\nTherefore, Glaucon, I said, whenever you meet with any of the eulogists\\nof Homer declaring that he has been the educator of Hellas, and that he\\nis profitable for education and for the ordering of human things, and\\nthat you should take him up again and again and get to know him and\\nregulate your whole life according to him, we may love and honour those\\nwho say these things—they are excellent people, as far as their lights\\nextend; and we are ready to acknowledge that Homer is the greatest of\\npoets and first of tragedy writers; but we must remain firm in our\\nconviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the\\nonly poetry which ought to be admitted into our State. For if you go\\nbeyond this and allow the honeyed muse to enter, either in epic or\\nlyric verse, not law and the reason of mankind, which by common consent\\nhave ever been deemed best, but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in\\nour State.\\n\\nThat is most true, he said.\\n\\nAnd now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry, let this our\\ndefence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in\\nsending away out of our State an art having the tendencies which we\\nhave described; for reason constrained us. But that she may not impute\\nto us any harshness or want of politeness, let us tell her that there\\nis an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry; of which there are\\nmany proofs, such as the saying of ‘the yelping hound howling at her\\nlord,’ or of one ‘mighty in the vain talk of fools,’ and ‘the mob of\\nsages circumventing Zeus,’ and the ‘subtle thinkers who are beggars\\nafter all’; and there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity\\nbetween them. Notwithstanding this, let us assure our sweet friend and\\nthe sister arts of imitation, that if she will only prove her title to\\nexist in a well-ordered State we shall be delighted to receive her—we\\nare very conscious of her charms; but we may not on that account betray\\nthe truth. I dare say, Glaucon, that you are as much charmed by her as\\nI am, especially when she appears in Homer?\\n\\nYes, indeed, I am greatly charmed.\\n\\nShall I propose, then, that she be allowed to return from exile, but\\nupon this condition only—that she make a defence of herself in lyrical\\nor some other metre?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nAnd we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of\\npoetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her\\nbehalf: let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to\\nStates and to human life, and we will listen in a kindly spirit; for if\\nthis can be proved we shall surely be the gainers—I mean, if there is a\\nuse in poetry as well as a delight?\\n\\nCertainly, he said, we shall be the gainers.\\n\\nIf her defence fails, then, my dear friend, like other persons who are\\nenamoured of something, but put a restraint upon themselves when they\\nthink their desires are opposed to their interests, so too must we\\nafter the manner of lovers give her up, though not without a struggle.\\nWe too are inspired by that love of poetry which the education of noble\\nStates has implanted in us, and therefore we would have her appear at\\nher best and truest; but so long as she is unable to make good her\\ndefence, this argument of ours shall be a charm to us, which we will\\nrepeat to ourselves while we listen to her strains; that we may not\\nfall away into the childish love of her which captivates the many. At\\nall events we are well aware that poetry being such as we have\\ndescribed is not to be regarded seriously as attaining to the truth;\\nand he who listens to her, fearing for the safety of the city which is\\nwithin him, should be on his guard against her seductions and make our\\nwords his law.\\n\\nYes, he said, I quite agree with you.\\n\\nYes, I said, my dear Glaucon, for great is the issue at stake, greater\\nthan appears, whether a man is to be good or bad. And what will any one\\nbe profited if under the influence of honour or money or power, aye, or\\nunder the excitement of poetry, he neglect justice and virtue?\\n\\nYes, he said; I have been convinced by the argument, as I believe that\\nany one else would have been.\\n\\nAnd yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards\\nwhich await virtue.\\n\\nWhat, are there any greater still? If there are, they must be of an\\ninconceivable greatness.\\n\\nWhy, I said, what was ever great in a short time? The whole period of\\nthree score years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison\\nwith eternity?\\n\\nSay rather ‘nothing,’ he replied.\\n\\nAnd should an immortal being seriously think of this little space\\nrather than of the whole?\\n\\nOf the whole, certainly. But why do you ask?\\n\\nAre you not aware, I said, that the soul of man is immortal and\\nimperishable?\\n\\nHe looked at me in astonishment, and said: No, by heaven: And are you\\nreally prepared to maintain this?\\n\\nYes, I said, I ought to be, and you too—there is no difficulty in\\nproving it.\\n\\nI see a great difficulty; but I should like to hear you state this\\nargument of which you make so light.\\n\\nListen then.\\n\\nI am attending.\\n\\nThere is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil?\\n\\nYes, he replied.\\n\\nWould you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying\\nelement is the evil, and the saving and improving element the good?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nAnd you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil; as\\nophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body; as\\nmildew is of corn, and rot of timber, or rust of copper and iron: in\\neverything, or in almost everything, there is an inherent evil and\\ndisease?\\n\\nYes, he said.\\n\\nAnd anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil, and\\nat last wholly dissolves and dies?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nThe vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of each;\\nand if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will; for\\ngood certainly will not destroy them, nor again, that which is neither\\ngood nor evil.\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nIf, then, we find any nature which having this inherent corruption\\ncannot be dissolved or destroyed, we may be certain that of such a\\nnature there is no destruction?\\n\\nThat may be assumed.\\n\\nWell, I said, and is there no evil which corrupts the soul?\\n\\nYes, he said, there are all the evils which we were just now passing in\\nreview: unrighteousness, intemperance, cowardice, ignorance.\\n\\nBut does any of these dissolve or destroy her?—and here do not let us\\nfall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man, when\\nhe is detected, perishes through his own injustice, which is an evil of\\nthe soul. Take the analogy of the body: The evil of the body is a\\ndisease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body; and all the\\nthings of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through\\ntheir own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so\\ndestroying them. Is not this true?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nConsider the soul in like manner. Does the injustice or other evil\\nwhich exists in the soul waste and consume her? Do they by attaching to\\nthe soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so\\nseparate her from the body?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nAnd yet, I said, it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish\\nfrom without through affection of external evil which could not be\\ndestroyed from within by a corruption of its own?\\n\\nIt is, he replied.\\n\\nConsider, I said, Glaucon, that even the badness of food, whether\\nstaleness, decomposition, or any other bad quality, when confined to\\nthe actual food, is not supposed to destroy the body; although, if the\\nbadness of food communicates corruption to the body, then we should say\\nthat the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself, which is\\ndisease, brought on by this; but that the body, being one thing, can be\\ndestroyed by the badness of food, which is another, and which does not\\nengender any natural infection—this we shall absolutely deny?\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd, on the same principle, unless some bodily evil can produce an evil\\nof the soul, we must not suppose that the soul, which is one thing, can\\nbe dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another?\\n\\nYes, he said, there is reason in that.\\n\\nEither, then, let us refute this conclusion, or, while it remains\\nunrefuted, let us never say that fever, or any other disease, or the\\nknife put to the throat, or even the cutting up of the whole body into\\nthe minutest pieces, can destroy the soul, until she herself is proved\\nto become more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things\\nbeing done to the body; but that the soul, or anything else if not\\ndestroyed by an internal evil, can be destroyed by an external one, is\\nnot to be affirmed by any man.\\n\\nAnd surely, he replied, no one will ever prove that the souls of men\\nbecome more unjust in consequence of death.\\n\\nBut if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the soul\\nboldly denies this, and says that the dying do really become more evil\\nand unrighteous, then, if the speaker is right, I suppose that\\ninjustice, like disease, must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust, and\\nthat those who take this disorder die by the natural inherent power of\\ndestruction which evil has, and which kills them sooner or later, but\\nin quite another way from that in which, at present, the wicked receive\\ndeath at the hands of others as the penalty of their deeds?\\n\\nNay, he said, in that case injustice, if fatal to the unjust, will not\\nbe so very terrible to him, for he will be delivered from evil. But I\\nrather suspect the opposite to be the truth, and that injustice which,\\nif it have the power, will murder others, keeps the murderer alive—aye,\\nand well awake too; so far removed is her dwelling-place from being a\\nhouse of death.\\n\\nTrue, I said; if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is\\nunable to kill or destroy her, hardly will that which is appointed to\\nbe the destruction of some other body, destroy a soul or anything else\\nexcept that of which it was appointed to be the destruction.\\n\\nYes, that can hardly be.\\n\\nBut the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil, whether inherent or\\nexternal, must exist for ever, and if existing for ever, must be\\nimmortal?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThat is the conclusion, I said; and, if a true conclusion, then the\\nsouls must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will not\\ndiminish in number. Neither will they increase, for the increase of the\\nimmortal natures must come from something mortal, and all things would\\nthus end in immortality.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nBut this we cannot believe—reason will not allow us—any more than we\\ncan believe the soul, in her truest nature, to be full of variety and\\ndifference and dissimilarity.\\n\\nWhat do you mean? he said.\\n\\nThe soul, I said, being, as is now proven, immortal, must be the\\nfairest of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\n\\nHer immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument, and there are\\nmany other proofs; but to see her as she really is, not as we now\\nbehold her, marred by communion with the body and other miseries, you\\nmust contemplate her with the eye of reason, in her original purity;\\nand then her beauty will be revealed, and justice and injustice and all\\nthe things which we have described will be manifested more clearly.\\nThus far, we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at\\npresent, but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a\\ncondition which may be compared to that of the sea-god Glaucus, whose\\noriginal image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are\\nbroken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways,\\nand incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and\\nstones, so that he is more like some monster than he is to his own\\nnatural form. And the soul which we behold is in a similar condition,\\ndisfigured by ten thousand ills. But not there, Glaucon, not there must\\nwe look.\\n\\nWhere then?\\n\\nAt her love of wisdom. Let us see whom she affects, and what society\\nand converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal\\nand eternal and divine; also how different she would become if wholly\\nfollowing this superior principle, and borne by a divine impulse out of\\nthe ocean in which she now is, and disengaged from the stones and\\nshells and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up\\naround her because she feeds upon earth, and is overgrown by the good\\nthings of this life as they are termed: then you would see her as she\\nis, and know whether she have one shape only or many, or what her\\nnature is. Of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this\\npresent life I think that we have now said enough.\\n\\nTrue, he replied.\\n\\nAnd thus, I said, we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument; we\\nhave not introduced the rewards and glories of justice, which, as you\\nwere saying, are to be found in Homer and Hesiod; but justice in her\\nown nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature.\\nLet a man do what is just, whether he have the ring of Gyges or not,\\nand even if in addition to the ring of Gyges he put on the helmet of\\nHades.\\n\\nVery true.\\n\\nAnd now, Glaucon, there will be no harm in further enumerating how many\\nand how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues\\nprocure to the soul from gods and men, both in life and after death.\\n\\nCertainly not, he said.\\n\\nWill you repay me, then, what you borrowed in the argument?\\n\\nWhat did I borrow?\\n\\nThe assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust\\njust: for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case\\ncould not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men, still this\\nadmission ought to be made for the sake of the argument, in order that\\npure justice might be weighed against pure injustice. Do you remember?\\n\\nI should be much to blame if I had forgotten.\\n\\nThen, as the cause is decided, I demand on behalf of justice that the\\nestimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we\\nacknowledge to be her due should now be restored to her by us; since\\nshe has been shown to confer reality, and not to deceive those who\\ntruly possess her, let what has been taken from her be given back, that\\nso she may win that palm of appearance which is hers also, and which\\nshe gives to her own.\\n\\nThe demand, he said, is just.\\n\\nIn the first place, I said—and this is the first thing which you will\\nhave to give back—the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known\\nto the gods.\\n\\nGranted.\\n\\nAnd if they are both known to them, one must be the friend and the\\nother the enemy of the gods, as we admitted from the beginning?\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all\\nthings at their best, excepting only such evil as is the necessary\\nconsequence of former sins?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nThen this must be our notion of the just man, that even when he is in\\npoverty or sickness, or any other seeming misfortune, all things will\\nin the end work together for good to him in life and death: for the\\ngods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be\\nlike God, as far as man can attain the divine likeness, by the pursuit\\nof virtue?\\n\\nYes, he said; if he is like God he will surely not be neglected by him.\\n\\nAnd of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed?\\n\\nCertainly.\\n\\nSuch, then, are the palms of victory which the gods give the just?\\n\\nThat is my conviction.\\n\\nAnd what do they receive of men? Look at things as they really are, and\\nyou will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners, who run\\nwell from the starting-place to the goal but not back again from the\\ngoal: they go off at a great pace, but in the end only look foolish,\\nslinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders, and without\\na crown; but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the prize\\nand is crowned. And this is the way with the just; he who endures to\\nthe end of every action and occasion of his entire life has a good\\nreport and carries off the prize which men have to bestow.\\n\\nTrue.\\n\\nAnd now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which you\\nwere attributing to the fortunate unjust. I shall say of them, what you\\nwere saying of the others, that as they grow older, they become rulers\\nin their own city if they care to be; they marry whom they like and\\ngive in marriage to whom they will; all that you said of the others I\\nnow say of these. And, on the other hand, of the unjust I say that the\\ngreater number, even though they escape in their youth, are found out\\nat last and look foolish at the end of their course, and when they come\\nto be old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen; they\\nare beaten and then come those things unfit for ears polite, as you\\ntruly term them; they will be racked and have their eyes burned out, as\\nyou were saying. And you may suppose that I have repeated the remainder\\nof your tale of horrors. But will you let me assume, without reciting\\nthem, that these things are true?\\n\\nCertainly, he said, what you say is true.\\n\\nThese, then, are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed\\nupon the just by gods and men in this present life, in addition to the\\nother good things which justice of herself provides.\\n\\nYes, he said; and they are fair and lasting.\\n\\nAnd yet, I said, all these are as nothing either in number or greatness\\nin comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and\\nunjust after death. And you ought to hear them, and then both just and\\nunjust will have received from us a full payment of the debt which the\\nargument owes to them.\\n\\nSpeak, he said; there are few things which I would more gladly hear.\\n\\nWell, I said, I will tell you a tale; not one of the tales which\\nOdysseus tells to the hero Alcinous, yet this too is a tale of a hero,\\nEr the son of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth. He was slain in battle,\\nand ten days afterwards, when the bodies of the dead were taken up\\nalready in a state of corruption, his body was found unaffected by\\ndecay, and carried away home to be buried. And on the twelfth day, as\\nhe was lying on the funeral pile, he returned to life and told them\\nwhat he had seen in the other world. He said that when his soul left\\nthe body he went on a journey with a great company, and that they came\\nto a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth;\\nthey were near together, and over against them were two other openings\\nin the heaven above. In the intermediate space there were judges\\nseated, who commanded the just, after they had given judgment on them\\nand had bound their sentences in front of them, to ascend by the\\nheavenly way on the right hand; and in like manner the unjust were\\nbidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand; these also\\nbore the symbols of their deeds, but fastened on their backs. He drew\\nnear, and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry\\nthe report of the other world to men, and they bade him hear and see\\nall that was to be heard and seen in that place. Then he beheld and saw\\non one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth\\nwhen sentence had been given on them; and at the two other openings\\nother souls, some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with\\ntravel, some descending out of heaven clean and bright. And arriving\\never and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey, and they\\nwent forth with gladness into the meadow, where they encamped as at a\\nfestival; and those who knew one another embraced and conversed, the\\nsouls which came from earth curiously enquiring about the things above,\\nand the souls which came from heaven about the things beneath. And they\\ntold one another of what had happened by the way, those from below\\nweeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of the things which they had\\nendured and seen in their journey beneath the earth (now the journey\\nlasted a thousand years), while those from above were describing\\nheavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty. The story,\\nGlaucon, would take too long to tell; but the sum was this:—He said\\nthat for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered\\ntenfold; or once in a hundred years—such being reckoned to be the\\nlength of man’s life, and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a\\nthousand years. If, for example, there were any who had been the cause\\nof many deaths, or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies, or been\\nguilty of any other evil behaviour, for each and all of their offences\\nthey received punishment ten times over, and the rewards of beneficence\\nand justice and holiness were in the same proportion. I need hardly\\nrepeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon as\\nthey were born. Of piety and impiety to gods and parents, and of\\nmurderers, there were retributions other and greater far which he\\ndescribed. He mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits\\nasked another, ‘Where is Ardiaeus the Great?’ (Now this Ardiaeus lived\\na thousand years before the time of Er: he had been the tyrant of some\\ncity of Pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and his elder\\nbrother, and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes.)\\nThe answer of the other spirit was: ‘He comes not hither and will never\\ncome. And this,’ said he, ‘was one of the dreadful sights which we\\nourselves witnessed. We were at the mouth of the cavern, and, having\\ncompleted all our experiences, were about to reascend, when of a sudden\\nArdiaeus appeared and several others, most of whom were tyrants; and\\nthere were also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been\\ngreat criminals: they were just, as they fancied, about to return into\\nthe upper world, but the mouth, instead of admitting them, gave a roar,\\nwhenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had not been\\nsufficiently punished tried to ascend; and then wild men of fiery\\naspect, who were standing by and heard the sound, seized and carried\\nthem off; and Ardiaeus and others they bound head and foot and hand,\\nand threw them down and flayed them with scourges, and dragged them\\nalong the road at the side, carding them on thorns like wool, and\\ndeclaring to the passers-by what were their crimes, and that they were\\nbeing taken away to be cast into hell.’ And of all the many terrors\\nwhich they had endured, he said that there was none like the terror\\nwhich each of them felt at that moment, lest they should hear the\\nvoice; and when there was silence, one by one they ascended with\\nexceeding joy. These, said Er, were the penalties and retributions, and\\nthere were blessings as great.\\n\\nNow when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days,\\non the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey, and, on\\nthe fourth day after, he said that they came to a place where they\\ncould see from above a line of light, straight as a column, extending\\nright through the whole heaven and through the earth, in colour\\nresembling the rainbow, only brighter and purer; another day’s journey\\nbrought them to the place, and there, in the midst of the light, they\\nsaw the ends of the chains of heaven let down from above: for this\\nlight is the belt of heaven, and holds together the circle of the\\nuniverse, like the under-girders of a trireme. From these ends is\\nextended the spindle of Necessity, on which all the revolutions turn.\\nThe shaft and hook of this spindle are made of steel, and the whorl is\\nmade partly of steel and also partly of other materials. Now the whorl\\nis in form like the whorl used on earth; and the description of it\\nimplied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped\\nout, and into this is fitted another lesser one, and another, and\\nanother, and four others, making eight in all, like vessels which fit\\ninto one another; the whorls show their edges on the upper side, and on\\ntheir lower side all together form one continuous whorl. This is\\npierced by the spindle, which is driven home through the centre of the\\neighth. The first and outermost whorl has the rim broadest, and the\\nseven inner whorls are narrower, in the following proportions—the sixth\\nis next to the first in size, the fourth next to the sixth; then comes\\nthe eighth; the seventh is fifth, the fifth is sixth, the third is\\nseventh, last and eighth comes the second. The largest (or fixed stars)\\nis spangled, and the seventh (or sun) is brightest; the eighth (or\\nmoon) coloured by the reflected light of the seventh; the second and\\nfifth (Saturn and Mercury) are in colour like one another, and yellower\\nthan the preceding; the third (Venus) has the whitest light; the fourth\\n(Mars) is reddish; the sixth (Jupiter) is in whiteness second. Now the\\nwhole spindle has the same motion; but, as the whole revolves in one\\ndirection, the seven inner circles move slowly in the other, and of\\nthese the swiftest is the eighth; next in swiftness are the seventh,\\nsixth, and fifth, which move together; third in swiftness appeared to\\nmove according to the law of this reversed motion the fourth; the third\\nappeared fourth and the second fifth. The spindle turns on the knees of\\nNecessity; and on the upper surface of each circle is a siren, who goes\\nround with them, hymning a single tone or note. The eight together form\\none harmony; and round about, at equal intervals, there is another\\nband, three in number, each sitting upon her throne: these are the\\nFates, daughters of Necessity, who are clothed in white robes and have\\nchaplets upon their heads, Lachesis and Clotho and Atropos, who\\naccompany with their voices the harmony of the sirens—Lachesis singing\\nof the past, Clotho of the present, Atropos of the future; Clotho from\\ntime to time assisting with a touch of her right hand the revolution of\\nthe outer circle of the whorl or spindle, and Atropos with her left\\nhand touching and guiding the inner ones, and Lachesis laying hold of\\neither in turn, first with one hand and then with the other.\\n\\nWhen Er and the spirits arrived, their duty was to go at once to\\nLachesis; but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in\\norder; then he took from the knees of Lachesis lots and samples of\\nlives, and having mounted a high pulpit, spoke as follows: ‘Hear the\\nword of Lachesis, the daughter of Necessity. Mortal souls, behold a new\\ncycle of life and mortality. Your genius will not be allotted to you,\\nbut you will choose your genius; and let him who draws the first lot\\nhave the first choice, and the life which he chooses shall be his\\ndestiny. Virtue is free, and as a man honours or dishonours her he will\\nhave more or less of her; the responsibility is with the chooser—God is\\njustified.’ When the Interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots\\nindifferently among them all, and each of them took up the lot which\\nfell near him, all but Er himself (he was not allowed), and each as he\\ntook his lot perceived the number which he had obtained. Then the\\nInterpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives; and\\nthere were many more lives than the souls present, and they were of all\\nsorts. There were lives of every animal and of man in every condition.\\nAnd there were tyrannies among them, some lasting out the tyrant’s\\nlife, others which broke off in the middle and came to an end in\\npoverty and exile and beggary; and there were lives of famous men, some\\nwho were famous for their form and beauty as well as for their strength\\nand success in games, or, again, for their birth and the qualities of\\ntheir ancestors; and some who were the reverse of famous for the\\nopposite qualities. And of women likewise; there was not, however, any\\ndefinite character in them, because the soul, when choosing a new life,\\nmust of necessity become different. But there was every other quality,\\nand the all mingled with one another, and also with elements of wealth\\nand poverty, and disease and health; and there were mean states also.\\nAnd here, my dear Glaucon, is the supreme peril of our human state; and\\ntherefore the utmost care should be taken. Let each one of us leave\\nevery other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one thing only, if\\nperadventure he may be able to learn and may find some one who will\\nmake him able to learn and discern between good and evil, and so to\\nchoose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity. He\\nshould consider the bearing of all these things which have been\\nmentioned severally and collectively upon virtue; he should know what\\nthe effect of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a\\nparticular soul, and what are the good and evil consequences of noble\\nand humble birth, of private and public station, of strength and\\nweakness, of cleverness and dullness, and of all the natural and\\nacquired gifts of the soul, and the operation of them when conjoined;\\nhe will then look at the nature of the soul, and from the consideration\\nof all these qualities he will be able to determine which is the better\\nand which is the worse; and so he will choose, giving the name of evil\\nto the life which will make his soul more unjust, and good to the life\\nwhich will make his soul more just; all else he will disregard. For we\\nhave seen and know that this is the best choice both in life and after\\ndeath. A man must take with him into the world below an adamantine\\nfaith in truth and right, that there too he may be undazzled by the\\ndesire of wealth or the other allurements of evil, lest, coming upon\\ntyrannies and similar villainies, he do irremediable wrongs to others\\nand suffer yet worse himself; but let him know how to choose the mean\\nand avoid the extremes on either side, as far as possible, not only in\\nthis life but in all that which is to come. For this is the way of\\nhappiness.\\n\\nAnd according to the report of the messenger from the other world this\\nwas what the prophet said at the time: ‘Even for the last comer, if he\\nchooses wisely and will live diligently, there is appointed a happy and\\nnot undesirable existence. Let not him who chooses first be careless,\\nand let not the last despair.’ And when he had spoken, he who had the\\nfirst choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny;\\nhis mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality, he had not\\nthought out the whole matter before he chose, and did not at first\\nsight perceive that he was fated, among other evils, to devour his own\\nchildren. But when he had time to reflect, and saw what was in the lot,\\nhe began to beat his breast and lament over his choice, forgetting the\\nproclamation of the prophet; for, instead of throwing the blame of his\\nmisfortune on himself, he accused chance and the gods, and everything\\nrather than himself. Now he was one of those who came from heaven, and\\nin a former life had dwelt in a well-ordered State, but his virtue was\\na matter of habit only, and he had no philosophy. And it was true of\\nothers who were similarly overtaken, that the greater number of them\\ncame from heaven and therefore they had never been schooled by trial,\\nwhereas the pilgrims who came from earth having themselves suffered and\\nseen others suffer, were not in a hurry to choose. And owing to this\\ninexperience of theirs, and also because the lot was a chance, many of\\nthe souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an evil for a good.\\nFor if a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated himself\\nfrom the first to sound philosophy, and had been moderately fortunate\\nin the number of the lot, he might, as the messenger reported, be happy\\nhere, and also his journey to another life and return to this, instead\\nof being rough and underground, would be smooth and heavenly. Most\\ncurious, he said, was the spectacle—sad and laughable and strange; for\\nthe choice of the souls was in most cases based on their experience of\\na previous life. There he saw the soul which had once been Orpheus\\nchoosing the life of a swan out of enmity to the race of women, hating\\nto be born of a woman because they had been his murderers; he beheld\\nalso the soul of Thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale; birds, on\\nthe other hand, like the swan and other musicians, wanting to be men.\\nThe soul which obtained the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion, and\\nthis was the soul of Ajax the son of Telamon, who would not be a man,\\nremembering the injustice which was done him in the judgment about the\\narms. The next was Agamemnon, who took the life of an eagle, because,\\nlike Ajax, he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings. About the\\nmiddle came the lot of Atalanta; she, seeing the great fame of an\\nathlete, was unable to resist the temptation: and after her there\\nfollowed the soul of Epeus the son of Panopeus passing into the nature\\nof a woman cunning in the arts; and far away among the last who chose,\\nthe soul of the jester Thersites was putting on the form of a monkey.\\nThere came also the soul of Odysseus having yet to make a choice, and\\nhis lot happened to be the last of them all. Now the recollection of\\nformer toils had disenchanted him of ambition, and he went about for a\\nconsiderable time in search of the life of a private man who had no\\ncares; he had some difficulty in finding this, which was lying about\\nand had been neglected by everybody else; and when he saw it, he said\\nthat he would have done the same had his lot been first instead of\\nlast, and that he was delighted to have it. And not only did men pass\\ninto animals, but I must also mention that there were animals tame and\\nwild who changed into one another and into corresponding human\\nnatures—the good into the gentle and the evil into the savage, in all\\nsorts of combinations.\\n\\nAll the souls had now chosen their lives, and they went in the order of\\ntheir choice to Lachesis, who sent with them the genius whom they had\\nseverally chosen, to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller\\nof the choice: this genius led the souls first to Clotho, and drew them\\nwithin the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand, thus\\nratifying the destiny of each; and then, when they were fastened to\\nthis, carried them to Atropos, who spun the threads and made them\\nirreversible, whence without turning round they passed beneath the\\nthrone of Necessity; and when they had all passed, they marched on in a\\nscorching heat to the plain of Forgetfulness, which was a barren waste\\ndestitute of trees and verdure; and then towards evening they encamped\\nby the river of Unmindfulness, whose water no vessel can hold; of this\\nthey were all obliged to drink a certain quantity, and those who were\\nnot saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary; and each one as he\\ndrank forgot all things. Now after they had gone to rest, about the\\nmiddle of the night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake, and then\\nin an instant they were driven upwards in all manner of ways to their\\nbirth, like stars shooting. He himself was hindered from drinking the\\nwater. But in what manner or by what means he returned to the body he\\ncould not say; only, in the morning, awaking suddenly, he found himself\\nlying on the pyre.\\n\\nAnd thus, Glaucon, the tale has been saved and has not perished, and\\nwill save us if we are obedient to the word spoken; and we shall pass\\nsafely over the river of Forgetfulness and our soul will not be\\ndefiled. Wherefore my counsel is, that we hold fast ever to the\\nheavenly way and follow after justice and virtue always, considering\\nthat the soul is immortal and able to endure every sort of good and\\nevery sort of evil. Thus shall we live dear to one another and to the\\ngods, both while remaining here and when, like conquerors in the games\\nwho go round to gather gifts, we receive our reward. And it shall be\\nwell with us both in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand\\nyears which we have been describing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE REPUBLIC ***\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

the form and institutions of\\nthe state are more clearly drawn out in the laws; as works of art, the\\nsymposium and the protagoras are of higher excellence. but no other\\ndialogue of plato has the same largeness of view and the same\\nperfection of style; no other shows an equal knowledge of the world, or\\ncontains more of those thoughts which are new as well as old, and not\\nof one age only but of all. nowhere in plato is there a deeper irony or\\na greater wealth of humour or imagery, or more dramatic power. nor in\\nany other of his writings is the attempt made to interweave life and\\nspeculation, or to connect politics with philosophy. the republic is\\nthe centre around which the other dialogues may be grouped; here\\nphilosophy reaches the highest point (cp, especially in books v, vi,\\nvii) to which ancient thinkers ever attained. plato among the greeks,\\nlike bacon among the moderns, was the first who conceived a method of\\nknowledge, although neither of them always distinguished the bare\\noutline or form from the substance of truth; and both of them had to be\\ncontent with an abstraction of science which was not yet realized. he\\nwas the greatest metaphysical genius whom the world has seen; and in\\nhim, more than in any other ancient thinker, the germs of future\\nknowledge are contained. the sciences of logic and psychology, which\\nhave supplied so many instruments of thought to after-ages, are based\\nupon the analyses of socrates and plato. the principles of definition,\\nthe law of contradiction, the fallacy of arguing in a circle, the\\ndistinction between the essence and accidents of a thing or notion,\\nbetween means and ends, between causes and conditions; also the\\ndivision of the mind into the rational, concupiscent, and irascible\\nelements, or of pleasures and desires into necessary and\\nunnecessary—these and other great forms of thought are all of them to\\nbe found in the republic, and were probably first invented by plato.\\nthe greatest of all logical truths, and the one of which writers on\\nphilosophy are most apt to lose sight, the difference between words and\\nthings, has been most strenuously insisted on by him (cp. rep.; polit.;\\ncratyl. 435, 436 ff), although he has not always avoided the confusion\\nof them in his own writings (e.g. rep.). but he does not bind up truth\\nin logical formulae,—logic is still veiled in metaphysics; and the\\nscience which he imagines to ‘contemplate all truth and all existence’\\nis very unlike the doctrine of the syllogism which aristotle claims to\\nhave discovered (soph. elenchi, 33. 18).\\n\\nneither must we forget that the republic is but the third part of a\\nstill larger design which was to have included an ideal history of\\nathens, as well as a political and physical philosophy. the fragment of\\nthe critias has given birth to a world-famous fiction, second only in\\nimportance to the tale of troy and the legend of arthur; and is said as\\na fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of the sixteenth\\ncentury. this mythical tale, of which the subject was a history of the\\nwars of the athenians against the island of atlantis, is supposed to be\\nfounded upon an unfinished poem of solon, to which it would have stood\\nin the same relation as the writings of the logographers to the poems\\nof homer. it would have told of a struggle for liberty (cp. tim. 25 c),\\nintended to represent the conflict of persia and hellas. we may judge\\nfrom the noble commencement of the timaeus, from the fragment of the\\ncritias itself, and from the third book of the laws, in what manner\\nplato would have treated this high argument. we can only guess why the\\ngreat design was abandoned; perhaps because plato became sensible of\\nsome incongruity in a fictitious history, or because he had lost his\\ninterest in it, or because advancing years forbade the completion of\\nit; and we may please ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary\\nnarrative ever been finished, we should have found plato himself\\nsympathising with the struggle for hellenic independence (cp. laws,\\niii. 698 ff.), singing a hymn of triumph over marathon and salamis,\\nperhaps making the reflection of herodotus (v. 78) where he\\ncontemplates the growth of the athenian empire—‘how brave a thing is\\nfreedom of speech, which has made the athenians so far exceed every\\nother state of hellas in greatness!’ or, more probably, attributing the\\nvictory to the ancient good order of athens and to the favor of apollo\\nand athene (cp. introd. to critias).\\n\\nagain, plato may be regarded as the ‘captain’ (‘arhchegoz’) or leader\\nof a goodly band of followers; for in the republic is to be found the\\noriginal of cicero’s de republica, of st. augustine’s city of god, of\\nthe utopia of sir thomas more, and of the numerous other imaginary\\nstates which are framed upon the same model. the extent to which\\naristotle or the aristotelian school were indebted to him in the\\npolitics has been little recognised, and the recognition is the more\\nnecessary because it is not made by aristotle himself. the two\\nphilosophers had more in common than they were conscious of; and\\nprobably some elements of plato remain still undetected in aristotle.\\nin english philosophy too, many affinities may be traced, not only in\\nthe works of the cambridge platonists, but in great original writers\\nlike berkeley or coleridge, to plato and his ideas. that there is a\\ntruth higher than experience, of which the mind bears witness to\\nherself, is a conviction which in our own generation has been\\nenthusiastically asserted, and is perhaps gaining ground. of the greek\\nauthors who at the renaissance brought a new life into the world plato\\nhas had the greatest influence. the republic of plato is also the first\\ntreatise upon education, of which the writings of milton and locke,\\nrousseau, jean paul, and goethe are the legitimate descendants. like\\ndante or bunyan, he has a revelation of another life; like bacon, he is\\nprofoundly impressed with the unity of knowledge; in the early church\\nhe exercised a real influence on theology, and at the revival of\\nliterature on politics. even the fragments of his words when ‘repeated\\nat second-hand’ (symp. 215 d) have in all ages ravished the hearts of\\nmen, who have seen reflected in them their own higher nature. he is the\\nfather of idealism in philosophy, in politics, in literature. and many\\nof the latest conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen, such as the\\nunity of knowledge, the reign of law, and the equality of the sexes,\\nhave been anticipated in a dream by him.\\n\\nthe argument of the republic is the search after justice, the nature of\\nwhich is first hinted at by cephalus, the just and blameless old\\nman—then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by socrates and\\npolemarchus—then caricatured by thrasymachus and partially explained by\\nsocrates—reduced to an abstraction by glaucon and adeimantus, and\\nhaving become invisible in the individual reappears at length in the\\nideal state which is constructed by socrates. the first care of the\\nrulers is to be education, of which an outline is drawn after the old\\nhellenic model, providing only for an improved religion and morality,\\nand more simplicity in music and gymnastic, a manlier strain of poetry,\\nand greater harmony of the individual and the state. we are thus led on\\nto the conception of a higher state, in which ‘no man calls anything\\nhis own,’ and in which there is neither ‘marrying nor giving in\\nmarriage,’ and ‘kings are philosophers’ and ‘philosophers are kings;’\\nand there is another and higher education, intellectual as well as\\nmoral and religious, of science as well as of art, and not of youth\\nonly but of the whole of life. such a state is hardly to be realized in\\nthis world and quickly degenerates. to the perfect ideal succeeds the\\ngovernment of the soldier and the lover of honour, this again declining\\ninto democracy, and democracy into tyranny, in an imaginary but regular\\norder having not much resemblance to the actual facts. when ‘the wheel\\nhas come full circle’ we do not begin again with a new period of human\\nlife; but we have passed from the best to the worst, and there we end.\\nthe subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry and\\nphilosophy which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books of\\nthe republic is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion. poetry is\\ndiscovered to be an imitation thrice removed from the truth, and homer,\\nas well as the dramatic poets, having been condemned as an imitator, is\\nsent into banishment along with them. and the idea of the state is\\nsupplemented by the revelation of a future life.\\n\\nthe division into books, like all similar divisions (cp. sir g.c. lewis\\nin the classical museum, vol. ii. p 1.), is probably later than the age\\nof plato. the natural divisions are five in number;—(1) book i and the\\nfirst half of book ii down to the paragraph beginning, ‘i had always\\nadmired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus,’ which is introductory;\\nthe first book containing a refutation of the popular and sophistical\\nnotions of justice, and concluding, like some of the earlier dialogues,\\nwithout arriving at any definite result. to this is appended a\\nrestatement of the nature of justice according to common opinion, and\\nan answer is demanded to the question—what is justice, stripped of\\nappearances? the second division (2) includes the remainder of the\\nsecond and the whole of the third and fourth books, which are mainly\\noccupied with the construction of the first state and the first\\neducation. the third division (3) consists of the fifth, sixth, and\\nseventh books, in which philosophy rather than justice is the subject\\nof enquiry, and the second state is constructed on principles of\\ncommunism and ruled by philosophers, and the contemplation of the idea\\nof good takes the place of the social and political virtues. in the\\neighth and ninth books (4) the perversions of states and of the\\nindividuals who correspond to them are reviewed in succession; and the\\nnature of pleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analysed in\\nthe individual man. the tenth book (5) is the conclusion of the whole,\\nin which the relations of philosophy to poetry are finally determined,\\nand the happiness of the citizens in this life, which has now been\\nassured, is crowned by the vision of another.\\n\\nor a more general division into two parts may be adopted; the first\\n(books i - iv) containing the description of a state framed generally\\nin accordance with hellenic notions of religion and morality, while in\\nthe second (books v - x) the hellenic state is transformed into an\\nideal kingdom of philosophy, of which all other governments are the\\nperversions. these two points of view are really opposed, and the\\nopposition is only veiled by the genius of plato. the republic, like\\nthe phaedrus (see introduction to phaedrus), is an imperfect whole; the\\nhigher light of philosophy breaks through the regularity of the\\nhellenic temple, which at last fades away into the heavens. whether\\nthis imperfection of structure arises from an enlargement of the plan;\\nor from the imperfect reconcilement in the writer’s own mind of the\\nstruggling elements of thought which are now first brought together by\\nhim; or, perhaps, from the composition of the work at different\\ntimes—are questions, like the similar question about the iliad and the\\nodyssey, which are worth asking, but which cannot have a distinct\\nanswer. in the age of plato there was no regular mode of publication,\\nand an author would have the less scruple in altering or adding to a\\nwork which was known only to a few of his friends. there is no\\nabsurdity in supposing that he may have laid his labours aside for a\\ntime, or turned from one work to another; and such interruptions would\\nbe more likely to occur in the case of a long than of a short writing.\\nin all attempts to determine the chronological order of the platonic\\nwritings on internal evidence, this uncertainty about any single\\ndialogue being composed at one time is a disturbing element, which must\\nbe admitted to affect longer works, such as the republic and the laws,\\nmore than shorter ones. but, on the other hand, the seeming\\ndiscrepancies of the republic may only arise out of the discordant\\nelements which the philosopher has attempted to unite in a single\\nwhole, perhaps without being himself able to recognise the\\ninconsistency which is obvious to us. for there is a judgment of after\\nages which few great writers have ever been able to anticipate for\\nthemselves. they do not perceive the want of connexion in their own\\nwritings, or the gaps in their systems which are visible enough to\\nthose who come after them. in the beginnings of literature and\\nphilosophy, amid the first efforts of thought and language, more\\ninconsistencies occur than now, when the paths of speculation are well\\nworn and the meaning of words precisely defined. for consistency, too,\\nis the growth of time; and some of the greatest creations of the human\\nmind have been wanting in unity. tried by this test, several of the\\nplatonic dialogues, according to our modern ideas, appear to be\\ndefective, but the deficiency is no proof that they were composed at\\ndifferent times or by different hands. and the supposition that the\\nrepublic was written uninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in\\nsome degree confirmed by the numerous references from one part of the\\nwork to another.\\n\\nthe second title, ‘concerning justice,’ is not the one by which the\\nrepublic is quoted, either by aristotle or generally in antiquity, and,\\nlike the other second titles of the platonic dialogues, may therefore\\nbe assumed to be of later date. morgenstern and others have asked\\nwhether the definition of justice, which is the professed aim, or the\\nconstruction of the state is the principal argument of the work. the\\nanswer is, that the two blend in one, and are two faces of the same\\ntruth; for justice is the order of the state, and the state is the\\nvisible embodiment of justice under the conditions of human society.\\nthe one is the soul and the other is the body, and the greek ideal of\\nthe state, as of the individual, is a fair mind in a fair body. in\\nhegelian phraseology the state is the reality of which justice is the\\nidea. or, described in christian language, the kingdom of god is\\nwithin, and yet developes into a church or external kingdom; ‘the house\\nnot made with hands, eternal in the heavens,’ is reduced to the\\nproportions of an earthly building. or, to use a platonic image,\\njustice and the state are the warp and the woof which run through the\\nwhole texture. and when the constitution of the state is completed, the\\nconception of justice is not dismissed, but reappears under the same or\\ndifferent names throughout the work, both as the inner law of the\\nindividual soul, and finally as the principle of rewards and\\npunishments in another life. the virtues are based on justice, of which\\ncommon honesty in buying and selling is the shadow, and justice is\\nbased on the idea of good, which is the harmony of the world, and is\\nreflected both in the institutions of states and in motions of the\\nheavenly bodies (cp. tim. 47). the timaeus, which takes up the\\npolitical rather than the ethical side of the republic, and is chiefly\\noccupied with hypotheses concerning the outward world, yet contains\\nmany indications that the same law is supposed to reign over the state,\\nover nature, and over man.\\n\\ntoo much, however, has been made of this question both in ancient and\\nmodern times. there is a stage of criticism in which all works, whether\\nof nature or of art, are referred to design. now in ancient writings,\\nand indeed in literature generally, there remains often a large element\\nwhich was not comprehended in the original design. for the plan grows\\nunder the author’s hand; new thoughts occur to him in the act of\\nwriting; he has not worked out the argument to the end before he\\nbegins. the reader who seeks to find some one idea under which the\\nwhole may be conceived, must necessarily seize on the vaguest and most\\ngeneral. thus stallbaum, who is dissatisfied with the ordinary\\nexplanations of the argument of the republic, imagines himself to have\\nfound the true argument ‘in the representation of human life in a state\\nperfected by justice, and governed according to the idea of good.’\\nthere may be some use in such general descriptions, but they can hardly\\nbe said to express the design of the writer. the truth is, that we may\\nas well speak of many designs as of one; nor need anything be excluded\\nfrom the plan of a great work to which the mind is naturally led by the\\nassociation of ideas, and which does not interfere with the general\\npurpose. what kind or degree of unity is to be sought after in a\\nbuilding, in the plastic arts, in poetry, in prose, is a problem which\\nhas to be determined relatively to the subject-matter. to plato\\nhimself, the enquiry ‘what was the intention of the writer,’ or ‘what\\nwas the principal argument of the republic’ would have been hardly\\nintelligible, and therefore had better be at once dismissed (cp. the\\nintroduction to the phaedrus).\\n\\nis not the republic the vehicle of three or four great truths which, to\\nplato’s own mind, are most naturally represented in the form of the\\nstate? just as in the jewish prophets the reign of messiah, or ‘the day\\nof the lord,’ or the suffering servant or people of god, or the ‘sun of\\nrighteousness with healing in his wings’ only convey, to us at least,\\ntheir great spiritual ideals, so through the greek state plato reveals\\nto us his own thoughts about divine perfection, which is the idea of\\ngood—like the sun in the visible world;—about human perfection, which\\nis justice—about education beginning in youth and continuing in later\\nyears—about poets and sophists and tyrants who are the false teachers\\nand evil rulers of mankind—about ‘the world’ which is the embodiment of\\nthem—about a kingdom which exists nowhere upon earth but is laid up in\\nheaven to be the pattern and rule of human life. no such inspired\\ncreation is at unity with itself, any more than the clouds of heaven\\nwhen the sun pierces through them. every shade of light and dark, of\\ntruth, and of fiction which is the veil of truth, is allowable in a\\nwork of philosophical imagination. it is not all on the same plane; it\\neasily passes from ideas to myths and fancies, from facts to figures of\\nspeech. it is not prose but poetry, at least a great part of it, and\\nought not to be judged by the rules of logic or the probabilities of\\nhistory. the writer is not fashioning his ideas into an artistic whole;\\nthey take possession of him and are too much for him. we have no need\\ntherefore to discuss whether a state such as plato has conceived is\\npracticable or not, or whether the outward form or the inward life came\\nfirst into the mind of the writer. for the practicability of his ideas\\nhas nothing to do with their truth; and the highest thoughts to which\\nhe attains may be truly said to bear the greatest ‘marks of\\ndesign’—justice more than the external frame-work of the state, the\\nidea of good more than justice. the great science of dialectic or the\\norganisation of ideas has no real content; but is only a type of the\\nmethod or spirit in which the higher knowledge is to be pursued by the\\nspectator of all time and all existence. it is in the fifth, sixth, and\\nseventh books that plato reaches the ‘summit of speculation,’ and\\nthese, although they fail to satisfy the requirements of a modern\\nthinker, may therefore be regarded as the most important, as they are\\nalso the most original, portions of the work.\\n\\nit is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question which has\\nbeen raised by boeckh, respecting the imaginary date at which the\\nconversation was held (the year 411 b.c. which is proposed by him will\\ndo as well as any other); for a writer of fiction, and especially a\\nwriter who, like plato, is notoriously careless of chronology (cp.\\nrep., symp., 193 a, etc.), only aims at general probability. whether\\nall the persons mentioned in the republic could ever have met at any\\none time is not a difficulty which would have occurred to an athenian\\nreading the work forty years later, or to plato himself at the time of\\nwriting (any more than to shakespeare respecting one of his own\\ndramas); and need not greatly trouble us now. yet this may be a\\nquestion having no answer ‘which is still worth asking,’ because the\\ninvestigation shows that we cannot argue historically from the dates in\\nplato; it would be useless therefore to waste time in inventing\\nfar-fetched reconcilements of them in order to avoid chronological\\ndifficulties, such, for example, as the conjecture of c.f. hermann,\\nthat glaucon and adeimantus are not the brothers but the uncles of\\nplato (cp. apol. 34 a), or the fancy of stallbaum that plato\\nintentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates at which some of\\nhis dialogues were written.\\n\\nthe principal characters in the republic are cephalus, polemarchus,\\nthrasymachus, socrates, glaucon, and adeimantus. cephalus appears in\\nthe introduction only, polemarchus drops at the end of the first\\nargument, and thrasymachus is reduced to silence at the close of the\\nfirst book. the main discussion is carried on by socrates, glaucon, and\\nadeimantus. among the company are lysias (the orator) and euthydemus,\\nthe sons of cephalus and brothers of polemarchus, an unknown\\ncharmantides—these are mute auditors; also there is cleitophon, who\\nonce interrupts, where, as in the dialogue which bears his name, he\\nappears as the friend and ally of thrasymachus.\\n\\ncephalus, the patriarch of the house, has been appropriately engaged in\\noffering a sacrifice. he is the pattern of an old man who has almost\\ndone with life, and is at peace with himself and with all mankind. he\\nfeels that he is drawing nearer to the world below, and seems to linger\\naround the memory of the past. he is eager that socrates should come to\\nvisit him, fond of the poetry of the last generation, happy in the\\nconsciousness of a well-spent life, glad at having escaped from the\\ntyranny of youthful lusts. his love of conversation, his affection, his\\nindifference to riches, even his garrulity, are interesting traits of\\ncharacter. he is not one of those who have nothing to say, because\\ntheir whole mind has been absorbed in making money. yet he acknowledges\\nthat riches have the advantage of placing men above the temptation to\\ndishonesty or falsehood. the respectful attention shown to him by\\nsocrates, whose love of conversation, no less than the mission imposed\\nupon him by the oracle, leads him to ask questions of all men, young\\nand old alike, should also be noted. who better suited to raise the\\nquestion of justice than cephalus, whose life might seem to be the\\nexpression of it? the moderation with which old age is pictured by\\ncephalus as a very tolerable portion of existence is characteristic,\\nnot only of him, but of greek feeling generally, and contrasts with the\\nexaggeration of cicero in the de senectute. the evening of life is\\ndescribed by plato in the most expressive manner, yet with the fewest\\npossible touches. as cicero remarks (ep. ad attic. iv. 16), the aged\\ncephalus would have been out of place in the discussion which follows,\\nand which he could neither have understood nor taken part in without a\\nviolation of dramatic propriety (cp. lysimachus in the laches).\\n\\nhis ‘son and heir’ polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousness of\\nyouth; he is for detaining socrates by force in the opening scene, and\\nwill not ‘let him off’ on the subject of women and children. like\\ncephalus, he is limited in his point of view, and represents the\\nproverbial stage of morality which has rules of life rather than\\nprinciples; and he quotes simonides (cp. aristoph. clouds) as his\\nfather had quoted pindar. but after this he has no more to say; the\\nanswers which he makes are only elicited from him by the dialectic of\\nsocrates. he has not yet experienced the influence of the sophists like\\nglaucon and adeimantus, nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting\\nthem; he belongs to the pre-socratic or pre-dialectical age. he is\\nincapable of arguing, and is bewildered by socrates to such a degree\\nthat he does not know what he is saying. he is made to admit that\\njustice is a thief, and that the virtues follow the analogy of the\\narts. from his brother lysias (contra eratosth.) we learn that he fell\\na victim to the thirty tyrants, but no allusion is here made to his\\nfate, nor to the circumstance that cephalus and his family were of\\nsyracusan origin, and had migrated from thurii to athens.\\n\\nthe ‘chalcedonian giant,’ thrasymachus, of whom we have already heard\\nin the phaedrus, is the personification of the sophists, according to\\nplato’s conception of them, in some of their worst characteristics. he\\nis vain and blustering, refusing to discourse unless he is paid, fond\\nof making an oration, and hoping thereby to escape the inevitable\\nsocrates; but a mere child in argument, and unable to foresee that the\\nnext ‘move’ (to use a platonic expression) will ‘shut him up.’ he has\\nreached the stage of framing general notions, and in this respect is in\\nadvance of cephalus and polemarchus. but he is incapable of defending\\nthem in a discussion, and vainly tries to cover his confusion with\\nbanter and insolence. whether such doctrines as are attributed to him\\nby plato were really held either by him or by any other sophist is\\nuncertain; in the infancy of philosophy serious errors about morality\\nmight easily grow up—they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers\\nin thucydides; but we are concerned at present with plato’s description\\nof him, and not with the historical reality. the inequality of the\\ncontest adds greatly to the humour of the scene. the pompous and empty\\nsophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great master of\\ndialectic, who knows how to touch all the springs of vanity and\\nweakness in him. he is greatly irritated by the irony of socrates, but\\nhis noisy and imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to the\\nthrusts of his assailant. his determination to cram down their throats,\\nor put ‘bodily into their souls’ his own words, elicits a cry of horror\\nfrom socrates. the state of his temper is quite as worthy of remark as\\nthe process of the argument. nothing is more amusing than his complete\\nsubmission when he has been once thoroughly beaten. at first he seems\\nto continue the discussion with reluctance, but soon with apparent\\ngood-will, and he even testifies his interest at a later stage by one\\nor two occasional remarks. when attacked by glaucon he is humorously\\nprotected by socrates ‘as one who has never been his enemy and is now\\nhis friend.’ from cicero and quintilian and from aristotle’s rhetoric\\nwe learn that the sophist whom plato has made so ridiculous was a man\\nof note whose writings were preserved in later ages. the play on his\\nname which was made by his contemporary herodicus (aris. rhet.), ‘thou\\nwast ever bold in battle,’ seems to show that the description of him is\\nnot devoid of verisimilitude.\\n\\nwhen thrasymachus has been silenced, the two principal respondents,\\nglaucon and adeimantus, appear on the scene: here, as in greek tragedy\\n(cp. introd. to phaedo), three actors are introduced. at first sight\\nthe two sons of ariston may seem to wear a family likeness, like the\\ntwo friends simmias and cebes in the phaedo. but on a nearer\\nexamination of them the similarity vanishes, and they are seen to be\\ndistinct characters. glaucon is the impetuous youth who can ‘just never\\nhave enough of fechting’ (cp. the character of him in xen. mem. iii.\\n6); the man of pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries of love;\\nthe ‘juvenis qui gaudet canibus,’ and who improves the breed of\\nanimals; the lover of art and music who has all the experiences of\\nyouthful life. he is full of quickness and penetration, piercing easily\\nbelow the clumsy platitudes of thrasymachus to the real difficulty; he\\nturns out to the light the seamy side of human life, and yet does not\\nlose faith in the just and true. it is glaucon who seizes what may be\\ntermed the ludicrous relation of the philosopher to the world, to whom\\na state of simplicity is ‘a city of pigs,’ who is always prepared with\\na jest when the argument offers him an opportunity, and who is ever\\nready to second the humour of socrates and to appreciate the\\nridiculous, whether in the connoisseurs of music, or in the lovers of\\ntheatricals, or in the fantastic behaviour of the citizens of\\ndemocracy. his weaknesses are several times alluded to by socrates,\\nwho, however, will not allow him to be attacked by his brother\\nadeimantus. he is a soldier, and, like adeimantus, has been\\ndistinguished at the battle of megara (anno 456?)...the character of\\nadeimantus is deeper and graver, and the profounder objections are\\ncommonly put into his mouth. glaucon is more demonstrative, and\\ngenerally opens the game. adeimantus pursues the argument further.\\nglaucon has more of the liveliness and quick sympathy of youth;\\nadeimantus has the maturer judgment of a grown-up man of the world. in\\nthe second book, when glaucon insists that justice and injustice shall\\nbe considered without regard to their consequences, adeimantus remarks\\nthat they are regarded by mankind in general only for the sake of their\\nconsequences; and in a similar vein of reflection he urges at the\\nbeginning of the fourth book that socrates fails in making his citizens\\nhappy, and is answered that happiness is not the first but the second\\nthing, not the direct aim but the indirect consequence of the good\\ngovernment of a state. in the discussion about religion and mythology,\\nadeimantus is the respondent, but glaucon breaks in with a slight jest,\\nand carries on the conversation in a lighter tone about music and\\ngymnastic to the end of the book. it is adeimantus again who volunteers\\nthe criticism of common sense on the socratic method of argument, and\\nwho refuses to let socrates pass lightly over the question of women and\\nchildren. it is adeimantus who is the respondent in the more\\nargumentative, as glaucon in the lighter and more imaginative portions\\nof the dialogue. for example, throughout the greater part of the sixth\\nbook, the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the conception of\\nthe idea of good are discussed with adeimantus. glaucon resumes his\\nplace of principal respondent; but he has a difficulty in apprehending\\nthe higher education of socrates, and makes some false hits in the\\ncourse of the discussion. once more adeimantus returns with the\\nallusion to his brother glaucon whom he compares to the contentious\\nstate; in the next book he is again superseded, and glaucon continues\\nto the end.\\n\\nthus in a succession of characters plato represents the successive\\nstages of morality, beginning with the athenian gentleman of the olden\\ntime, who is followed by the practical man of that day regulating his\\nlife by proverbs and saws; to him succeeds the wild generalization of\\nthe sophists, and lastly come the young disciples of the great teacher,\\nwho know the sophistical arguments but will not be convinced by them,\\nand desire to go deeper into the nature of things. these too, like\\ncephalus, polemarchus, thrasymachus, are clearly distinguished from one\\nanother. neither in the republic, nor in any other dialogue of plato,\\nis a single character repeated.\\n\\nthe delineation of socrates in the republic is not wholly consistent.\\nin the first book we have more of the real socrates, such as he is\\ndepicted in the memorabilia of xenophon, in the earliest dialogues of\\nplato, and in the apology. he is ironical, provoking, questioning, the\\nold enemy of the sophists, ready to put on the mask of silenus as well\\nas to argue seriously. but in the sixth book his enmity towards the\\nsophists abates; he acknowledges that they are the representatives\\nrather than the corrupters of the world. he also becomes more dogmatic\\nand constructive, passing beyond the range either of the political or\\nthe speculative ideas of the real socrates. in one passage plato\\nhimself seems to intimate that the time had now come for socrates, who\\nhad passed his whole life in philosophy, to give his own opinion and\\nnot to be always repeating the notions of other men. there is no\\nevidence that either the idea of good or the conception of a perfect\\nstate were comprehended in the socratic teaching, though he certainly\\ndwelt on the nature of the universal and of final causes (cp. xen.\\nmem.; phaedo); and a deep thinker like him, in his thirty or forty\\nyears of public teaching, could hardly have failed to touch on the\\nnature of family relations, for which there is also some positive\\nevidence in the memorabilia (mem.) the socratic method is nominally\\nretained; and every inference is either put into the mouth of the\\nrespondent or represented as the common discovery of him and socrates.\\nbut any one can see that this is a mere form, of which the affectation\\ngrows wearisome as the work advances. the method of enquiry has passed\\ninto a method of teaching in which by the help of interlocutors the\\nsame thesis is looked at from various points of view. the nature of the\\nprocess is truly characterized by glaucon, when he describes himself as\\na companion who is not good for much in an investigation, but can see\\nwhat he is shown, and may, perhaps, give the answer to a question more\\nfluently than another.\\n\\nneither can we be absolutely certain that socrates himself taught the\\nimmortality of the soul, which is unknown to his disciple glaucon in\\nthe republic (cp. apol.); nor is there any reason to suppose that he\\nused myths or revelations of another world as a vehicle of instruction,\\nor that he would have banished poetry or have denounced the greek\\nmythology. his favorite oath is retained, and a slight mention is made\\nof the daemonium, or internal sign, which is alluded to by socrates as\\na phenomenon peculiar to himself. a real element of socratic teaching,\\nwhich is more prominent in the republic than in any of the other\\ndialogues of plato, is the use of example and illustration τὰ φορτικὰ\\nαὐτῷ προσφέροντες, ‘let us apply the test of common instances.’ ‘you,’\\nsays adeimantus, ironically, in the sixth book, ‘are so unaccustomed to\\nspeak in images.’ and this use of examples or images, though truly\\nsocratic in origin, is enlarged by the genius of plato into the form of\\nan allegory or parable, which embodies in the concrete what has been\\nalready described, or is about to be described, in the abstract. thus\\nthe figure of the cave in book vii is a recapitulation of the divisions\\nof knowledge in book vi. the composite animal in book ix is an allegory\\nof the parts of the soul. the noble captain and the ship and the true\\npilot in book vi are a figure of the relation of the people to the\\nphilosophers in the state which has been described. other figures, such\\nas the dog, or the marriage of the portionless maiden, or the drones\\nand wasps in the eighth and ninth books, also form links of connexion\\nin long passages, or are used to recall previous discussions.\\n\\nplato is most true to the character of his master when he describes him\\nas ‘not of this world.’ and with this representation of him the ideal\\nstate and the other paradoxes of the republic are quite in accordance,\\nthough they cannot be shown to have been speculations of socrates. to\\nhim, as to other great teachers both philosophical and religious, when\\nthey looked upward, the world seemed to be the embodiment of error and\\nevil. the common sense of mankind has revolted against this view, or\\nhas only partially admitted it. and even in socrates himself the\\nsterner judgement of the multitude at times passes into a sort of\\nironical pity or love. men in general are incapable of philosophy, and\\nare therefore at enmity with the philosopher; but their\\nmisunderstanding of him is unavoidable: for they have never seen him as\\nhe truly is in his own image; they are only acquainted with artificial\\nsystems possessing no native force of truth—words which admit of many\\napplications. their leaders have nothing to measure with, and are\\ntherefore ignorant of their own stature. but they are to be pitied or\\nlaughed at, not to be quarrelled with; they mean well with their\\nnostrums, if they could only learn that they are cutting off a hydra’s\\nhead. this moderation towards those who are in error is one of the most\\ncharacteristic features of socrates in the republic. in all the\\ndifferent representations of socrates, whether of xenophon or plato,\\nand amid the differences of the earlier or later dialogues, he always\\nretains the character of the unwearied and disinterested seeker after\\ntruth, without which he would have ceased to be socrates.\\n\\nleaving the characters we may now analyse the contents of the republic,\\nand then proceed to consider (1) the general aspects of this hellenic\\nideal of the state, (2) the modern lights in which the thoughts of\\nplato may be read.\\n\\nbook i. the republic opens with a truly greek scene—a festival in\\nhonour of the goddess bendis which is held in the piraeus; to this is\\nadded the promise of an equestrian torch-race in the evening. the whole\\nwork is supposed to be recited by socrates on the day after the\\nfestival to a small party, consisting of critias, timaeus, hermocrates,\\nand another; this we learn from the first words of the timaeus.\\n\\nwhen the rhetorical advantage of reciting the dialogue has been gained,\\nthe attention is not distracted by any reference to the audience; nor\\nis the reader further reminded of the extraordinary length of the\\nnarrative. of the numerous company, three only take any serious part in\\nthe discussion; nor are we informed whether in the evening they went to\\nthe torch-race, or talked, as in the symposium, through the night. the\\nmanner in which the conversation has arisen is described as\\nfollows:—socrates and his companion glaucon are about to leave the\\nfestival when they are detained by a message from polemarchus, who\\nspeedily appears accompanied by adeimantus, the brother of glaucon, and\\nwith playful violence compels them to remain, promising them not only\\nthe torch-race, but the pleasure of conversation with the young, which\\nto socrates is a far greater attraction. they return to the house of\\ncephalus, polemarchus’ father, now in extreme old age, who is found\\nsitting upon a cushioned seat crowned for a sacrifice. ‘you should come\\nto me oftener, socrates, for i am too old to go to you; and at my time\\nof life, having lost other pleasures, i care the more for\\nconversation.’ socrates asks him what he thinks of age, to which the\\nold man replies, that the sorrows and discontents of age are to be\\nattributed to the tempers of men, and that age is a time of peace in\\nwhich the tyranny of the passions is no longer felt. yes, replies\\nsocrates, but the world will say, cephalus, that you are happy in old\\nage because you are rich. ‘and there is something in what they say,\\nsocrates, but not so much as they imagine—as themistocles replied to\\nthe seriphian, “neither you, if you had been an athenian, nor i, if i\\nhad been a seriphian, would ever have been famous,” i might in like\\nmanner reply to you, neither a good poor man can be happy in age, nor\\nyet a bad rich man.’ socrates remarks that cephalus appears not to care\\nabout riches, a quality which he ascribes to his having inherited, not\\nacquired them, and would like to know what he considers to be the chief\\nadvantage of them. cephalus answers that when you are old the belief in\\nthe world below grows upon you, and then to have done justice and never\\nto have been compelled to do injustice through poverty, and never to\\nhave deceived anyone, are felt to be unspeakable blessings. socrates,\\nwho is evidently preparing for an argument, next asks, what is the\\nmeaning of the word justice? to tell the truth and pay your debts? no\\nmore than this? or must we admit exceptions? ought i, for example, to\\nput back into the hands of my friend, who has gone mad, the sword which\\ni borrowed of him when he was in his right mind? ‘there must be\\nexceptions.’ ‘and yet,’ says polemarchus, ‘the definition which has\\nbeen given has the authority of simonides.’ here cephalus retires to\\nlook after the sacrifices, and bequeaths, as socrates facetiously\\nremarks, the possession of the argument to his heir, polemarchus...\\n\\nthe description of old age is finished, and plato, as his manner is,\\nhas touched the key-note of the whole work in asking for the definition\\nof justice, first suggesting the question which glaucon afterwards\\npursues respecting external goods, and preparing for the concluding\\nmythus of the world below in the slight allusion of cephalus. the\\nportrait of the just man is a natural frontispiece or introduction to\\nthe long discourse which follows, and may perhaps imply that in all our\\nperplexity about the nature of justice, there is no difficulty in\\ndiscerning ‘who is a just man.’ the first explanation has been\\nsupported by a saying of simonides; and now socrates has a mind to show\\nthat the resolution of justice into two unconnected precepts, which\\nhave no common principle, fails to satisfy the demands of dialectic.\\n\\n...he proceeds: what did simonides mean by this saying of his? did he\\nmean that i was to give back arms to a madman? ‘no, not in that case,\\nnot if the parties are friends, and evil would result. he meant that\\nyou were to do what was proper, good to friends and harm to enemies.’\\nevery act does something to somebody; and following this analogy,\\nsocrates asks, what is this due and proper thing which justice does,\\nand to whom? he is answered that justice does good to friends and harm\\nto enemies. but in what way good or harm? ‘in making alliances with the\\none, and going to war with the other.’ then in time of peace what is\\nthe good of justice? the answer is that justice is of use in contracts,\\nand contracts are money partnerships. yes; but how in such partnerships\\nis the just man of more use than any other man? ‘when you want to have\\nmoney safely kept and not used.’ then justice will be useful when money\\nis useless. and there is another difficulty: justice, like the art of\\nwar or any other art, must be of opposites, good at attack as well as\\nat defence, at stealing as well as at guarding. but then justice is a\\nthief, though a hero notwithstanding, like autolycus, the homeric hero,\\nwho was ‘excellent above all men in theft and perjury’—to such a pass\\nhave you and homer and simonides brought us; though i do not forget\\nthat the thieving must be for the good of friends and the harm of\\nenemies. and still there arises another question: are friends to be\\ninterpreted as real or seeming; enemies as real or seeming? and are our\\nfriends to be only the good, and our enemies to be the evil? the answer\\nis, that we must do good to our seeming and real good friends, and evil\\nto our seeming and real evil enemies—good to the good, evil to the\\nevil. but ought we to render evil for evil at all, when to do so will\\nonly make men more evil? can justice produce injustice any more than\\nthe art of horsemanship can make bad horsemen, or heat produce cold?\\nthe final conclusion is, that no sage or poet ever said that the just\\nreturn evil for evil; this was a maxim of some rich and mighty man,\\nperiander, perdiccas, or ismenias the theban (about b.c. 398-381)...\\n\\nthus the first stage of aphoristic or unconscious morality is shown to\\nbe inadequate to the wants of the age; the authority of the poets is\\nset aside, and through the winding mazes of dialectic we make an\\napproach to the christian precept of forgiveness of injuries. similar\\nwords are applied by the persian mystic poet to the divine being when\\nthe questioning spirit is stirred within him:—‘if because i do evil,\\nthou punishest me by evil, what is the difference between thee and me?’\\nin this both plato and kheyam rise above the level of many christian\\n(?) theologians. the first definition of justice easily passes into the\\nsecond; for the simple words ‘to speak the truth and pay your debts’ is\\nsubstituted the more abstract ‘to do good to your friends and harm to\\nyour enemies.’ either of these explanations gives a sufficient rule of\\nlife for plain men, but they both fall short of the precision of\\nphilosophy. we may note in passing the antiquity of casuistry, which\\nnot only arises out of the conflict of established principles in\\nparticular cases, but also out of the effort to attain them, and is\\nprior as well as posterior to our fundamental notions of morality. the\\n‘interrogation’ of moral ideas; the appeal to the authority of homer;\\nthe conclusion that the maxim, ‘do good to your friends and harm to\\nyour enemies,’ being erroneous, could not have been the word of any\\ngreat man, are all of them very characteristic of the platonic\\nsocrates.\\n\\n...here thrasymachus, who has made several attempts to interrupt, but\\nhas hitherto been kept in order by the company, takes advantage of a\\npause and rushes into the arena, beginning, like a savage animal, with\\na roar. ‘socrates,’ he says, ‘what folly is this?—why do you agree to\\nbe vanquished by one another in a pretended argument?’ he then\\nprohibits all the ordinary definitions of justice; to which socrates\\nreplies that he cannot tell how many twelve is, if he is forbidden to\\nsay 2 x 6, or 3 x 4, or 6 x 2, or 4 x 3. at first thrasymachus is\\nreluctant to argue; but at length, with a promise of payment on the\\npart of the company and of praise from socrates, he is induced to open\\nthe game. ‘listen,’ he says, ‘my answer is that might is right, justice\\nthe interest of the stronger: now praise me.’ let me understand you\\nfirst. do you mean that because polydamas the wrestler, who is stronger\\nthan we are, finds the eating of beef for his interest, the eating of\\nbeef is also for our interest, who are not so strong? thrasymachus is\\nindignant at the illustration, and in pompous words, apparently\\nintended to restore dignity to the argument, he explains his meaning to\\nbe that the rulers make laws for their own interests. but suppose, says\\nsocrates, that the ruler or stronger makes a mistake—then the interest\\nof the stronger is not his interest. thrasymachus is saved from this\\nspeedy downfall by his disciple cleitophon, who introduces the word\\n‘thinks;’—not the actual interest of the ruler, but what he thinks or\\nwhat seems to be his interest, is justice. the contradiction is escaped\\nby the unmeaning evasion: for though his real and apparent interests\\nmay differ, what the ruler thinks to be his interest will always remain\\nwhat he thinks to be his interest.\\n\\nof course this was not the original assertion, nor is the new\\ninterpretation accepted by thrasymachus himself. but socrates is not\\ndisposed to quarrel about words, if, as he significantly insinuates,\\nhis adversary has changed his mind. in what follows thrasymachus does\\nin fact withdraw his admission that the ruler may make a mistake, for\\nhe affirms that the ruler as a ruler is infallible. socrates is quite\\nready to accept the new position, which he equally turns against\\nthrasymachus by the help of the analogy of the arts. every art or\\nscience has an interest, but this interest is to be distinguished from\\nthe accidental interest of the artist, and is only concerned with the\\ngood of the things or persons which come under the art. and justice has\\nan interest which is the interest not of the ruler or judge, but of\\nthose who come under his sway.\\n\\nthrasymachus is on the brink of the inevitable conclusion, when he\\nmakes a bold diversion. ‘tell me, socrates,’ he says, ‘have you a\\nnurse?’ what a question! why do you ask? ‘because, if you have, she\\nneglects you and lets you go about drivelling, and has not even taught\\nyou to know the shepherd from the sheep. for you fancy that shepherds\\nand rulers never think of their own interest, but only of their sheep\\nor subjects, whereas the truth is that they fatten them for their use,\\nsheep and subjects alike. and experience proves that in every relation\\nof life the just man is the loser and the unjust the gainer, especially\\nwhere injustice is on the grand scale, which is quite another thing\\nfrom the petty rogueries of swindlers and burglars and robbers of\\ntemples. the language of men proves this—our ‘gracious’ and ‘blessed’\\ntyrant and the like—all which tends to show (1) that justice is the\\ninterest of the stronger; and (2) that injustice is more profitable and\\nalso stronger than justice.’\\n\\nthrasymachus, who is better at a speech than at a close argument,\\nhaving deluged the company with words, has a mind to escape. but the\\nothers will not let him go, and socrates adds a humble but earnest\\nrequest that he will not desert them at such a crisis of their fate.\\n‘and what can i do more for you?’ he says; ‘would you have me put the\\nwords bodily into your souls?’ god forbid! replies socrates; but we\\nwant you to be consistent in the use of terms, and not to employ\\n‘physician’ in an exact sense, and then again ‘shepherd’ or ‘ruler’ in\\nan inexact,—if the words are strictly taken, the ruler and the shepherd\\nlook only to the good of their people or flocks and not to their own:\\nwhereas you insist that rulers are solely actuated by love of office.\\n‘no doubt about it,’ replies thrasymachus. then why are they paid? is\\nnot the reason, that their interest is not comprehended in their art,\\nand is therefore the concern of another art, the art of pay, which is\\ncommon to the arts in general, and therefore not identical with any one\\nof them? nor would any man be a ruler unless he were induced by the\\nhope of reward or the fear of punishment;—the reward is money or\\nhonour, the punishment is the necessity of being ruled by a man worse\\nthan himself. and if a state (or church) were composed entirely of good\\nmen, they would be affected by the last motive only; and there would be\\nas much ‘nolo episcopari’ as there is at present of the opposite...\\n\\nthe satire on existing governments is heightened by the simple and\\napparently incidental manner in which the last remark is introduced.\\nthere is a similar irony in the argument that the governors of mankind\\ndo not like being in office, and that therefore they demand pay.\\n\\n...enough of this: the other assertion of thrasymachus is far more\\nimportant—that the unjust life is more gainful than the just. now, as\\nyou and i, glaucon, are not convinced by him, we must reply to him; but\\nif we try to compare their respective gains we shall want a judge to\\ndecide for us; we had better therefore proceed by making mutual\\nadmissions of the truth to one another.\\n\\nthrasymachus had asserted that perfect injustice was more gainful than\\nperfect justice, and after a little hesitation he is induced by\\nsocrates to admit the still greater paradox that injustice is virtue\\nand justice vice. socrates praises his frankness, and assumes the\\nattitude of one whose only wish is to understand the meaning of his\\nopponents. at the same time he is weaving a net in which thrasymachus\\nis finally enclosed. the admission is elicited from him that the just\\nman seeks to gain an advantage over the unjust only, but not over the\\njust, while the unjust would gain an advantage over either. socrates,\\nin order to test this statement, employs once more the favourite\\nanalogy of the arts. the musician, doctor, skilled artist of any sort,\\ndoes not seek to gain more than the skilled, but only more than the\\nunskilled (that is to say, he works up to a rule, standard, law, and\\ndoes not exceed it), whereas the unskilled makes random efforts at\\nexcess. thus the skilled falls on the side of the good, and the\\nunskilled on the side of the evil, and the just is the skilled, and the\\nunjust is the unskilled.\\n\\nthere was great difficulty in bringing thrasymachus to the point; the\\nday was hot and he was streaming with perspiration, and for the first\\ntime in his life he was seen to blush. but his other thesis that\\ninjustice was stronger than justice has not yet been refuted, and\\nsocrates now proceeds to the consideration of this, which, with the\\nassistance of thrasymachus, he hopes to clear up; the latter is at\\nfirst churlish, but in the judicious hands of socrates is soon restored\\nto good-humour: is there not honour among thieves? is not the strength\\nof injustice only a remnant of justice? is not absolute injustice\\nabsolute weakness also? a house that is divided against itself cannot\\nstand; two men who quarrel detract from one another’s strength, and he\\nwho is at war with himself is the enemy of himself and the gods. not\\nwickedness therefore, but semi-wickedness flourishes in states,—a\\nremnant of good is needed in order to make union in action\\npossible,—there is no kingdom of evil in this world.\\n\\nanother question has not been answered: is the just or the unjust the\\nhappier? to this we reply, that every art has an end and an excellence\\nor virtue by which the end is accomplished. and is not the end of the\\nsoul happiness, and justice the excellence of the soul by which\\nhappiness is attained? justice and happiness being thus shown to be\\ninseparable, the question whether the just or the unjust is the happier\\nhas disappeared.\\n\\nthrasymachus replies: ‘let this be your entertainment, socrates, at the\\nfestival of bendis.’ yes; and a very good entertainment with which your\\nkindness has supplied me, now that you have left off scolding. and yet\\nnot a good entertainment—but that was my own fault, for i tasted of too\\nmany things. first of all the nature of justice was the subject of our\\nenquiry, and then whether justice is virtue and wisdom, or evil and\\nfolly; and then the comparative advantages of just and unjust: and the\\nsum of all is that i know not what justice is; how then shall i know\\nwhether the just is happy or not?...\\n\\nthus the sophistical fabric has been demolished, chiefly by appealing\\nto the analogy of the arts. ‘justice is like the arts (1) in having no\\nexternal interest, and (2) in not aiming at excess, and (3) justice is\\nto happiness what the implement of the workman is to his work.’ at this\\nthe modern reader is apt to stumble, because he forgets that plato is\\nwriting in an age when the arts and the virtues, like the moral and\\nintellectual faculties, were still undistinguished. among early\\nenquirers into the nature of human action the arts helped to fill up\\nthe void of speculation; and at first the comparison of the arts and\\nthe virtues was not perceived by them to be fallacious. they only saw\\nthe points of agreement in them and not the points of difference.\\nvirtue, like art, must take means to an end; good manners are both an\\nart and a virtue; character is naturally described under the image of a\\nstatue; and there are many other figures of speech which are readily\\ntransferred from art to morals. the next generation cleared up these\\nperplexities; or at least supplied after ages with a further analysis\\nof them. the contemporaries of plato were in a state of transition, and\\nhad not yet fully realized the common-sense distinction of aristotle,\\nthat ‘virtue is concerned with action, art with production’ (nic.\\neth.), or that ‘virtue implies intention and constancy of purpose,’\\nwhereas ‘art requires knowledge only’. and yet in the absurdities which\\nfollow from some uses of the analogy, there seems to be an intimation\\nconveyed that virtue is more than art. this is implied in the reductio\\nad absurdum that ‘justice is a thief,’ and in the dissatisfaction which\\nsocrates expresses at the final result.\\n\\nthe expression ‘an art of pay’ which is described as ‘common to all the\\narts’ is not in accordance with the ordinary use of language. nor is it\\nemployed elsewhere either by plato or by any other greek writer. it is\\nsuggested by the argument, and seems to extend the conception of art to\\ndoing as well as making. another flaw or inaccuracy of language may be\\nnoted in the words ‘men who are injured are made more unjust.’ for\\nthose who are injured are not necessarily made worse, but only harmed\\nor illtreated.\\nthe second of the three arguments that the just does not aim at excess   has a real meaning, though wrapped up in an enigmatical form.\\nthat the good is of the nature of the finite is a peculiarly hellenic\\nsentiment, which may be compared with the language of those modern\\nwriters who speak of virtue as fitness, and of freedom as obedience to\\nlaw. the mathematical or logical notion of limit easily passes into an\\nethical one, and even finds a mythological expression in the conception\\nof envy (greek). ideas of measure, equality, order, unity, proportion,\\nstill linger in the writings of moralists; and the true spirit of the\\nfine arts is better conveyed by such terms than by superlatives.\\n\\n‘when workmen strive to do better than well,\\nthey do confound their skill in covetousness.’ (king john. act. iv. sc.\\n2.)\\n\\n\\nthe harmony of the soul and body, and of the parts of the soul with one\\nanother, a harmony ‘fairer than that of musical notes,’ is the true\\nhellenic mode of conceiving the perfection of human nature.\\n\\nin what may be called the epilogue of the discussion with thrasymachus,\\nplato argues that evil is not a principle of strength, but of discord\\nand dissolution, just touching the question which has been often\\ntreated in modern times by theologians and philosophers, of the\\nnegative nature of evil. in the last argument we trace the germ of the\\naristotelian doctrine of an end and a virtue directed towards the end,\\nwhich again is suggested by the arts. the final reconcilement of\\njustice and happiness and the identity of the individual and the state\\nare also intimated. socrates reassumes the character of a\\n‘know-nothing;’ at the same time he appears to be not wholly satisfied\\nwith the manner in which the argument has been conducted. nothing is\\nconcluded; but the tendency of the dialectical process, here as always,\\nis to enlarge our conception of ideas, and to widen their application\\nto human life.\\n\\nbook ii. thrasymachus is pacified, but the intrepid glaucon insists on\\ncontinuing the argument. he is not satisfied with the indirect manner\\nin which, at the end of the last book, socrates had disposed of the\\nquestion ‘whether the just or the unjust is the happier.’ he begins by\\ndividing goods into three classes:—first, goods desirable in\\nthemselves; secondly, goods desirable in themselves and for their\\nresults; thirdly, goods desirable for their results only. he then asks\\nsocrates in which of the three classes he would place justice. in the\\nsecond class, replies socrates, among goods desirable for themselves\\nand also for their results. ‘then the world in general are of another\\nmind, for they say that justice belongs to the troublesome class of\\ngoods which are desirable for their results only. socrates answers that\\nthis is the doctrine of thrasymachus which he rejects. glaucon thinks\\nthat thrasymachus was too ready to listen to the voice of the charmer,\\nand proposes to consider the nature of justice and injustice in\\nthemselves and apart from the results and rewards of them which the\\nworld is always dinning in his ears. he will first of all speak of the\\nnature and origin of justice; secondly, of the manner in which men view\\njustice as a necessity and not a good; and thirdly, he will prove the\\nreasonableness of this view.\\n\\n‘to do injustice is said to be a good; to suffer injustice an evil. as\\nthe evil is discovered by experience to be greater than the good, the\\nsufferers, who cannot also be doers, make a compact that they will have\\nneither, and this compact or mean is called justice, but is really the\\nimpossibility of doing injustice. no one would observe such a compact\\nif he were not obliged. let us suppose that the just and unjust have\\ntwo rings, like that of gyges in the well-known story, which make them\\ninvisible, and then no difference will appear in them, for every one\\nwill do evil if he can. and he who abstains will be regarded by the\\nworld as a fool for his pains. men may praise him in public out of fear\\nfor themselves, but they will laugh at him in their hearts (cp.\\ngorgias.)\\n\\n‘and now let us frame an ideal of the just and unjust. imagine the\\nunjust man to be master of his craft, seldom making mistakes and easily\\ncorrecting them; having gifts of money, speech, strength—the greatest\\nvillain bearing the highest character: and at his side let us place the\\njust in his nobleness and simplicity—being, not seeming—without name or\\nreward—clothed in his justice only—the best of men who is thought to be\\nthe worst, and let him die as he has lived. i might add (but i would\\nrather put the rest into the mouth of the panegyrists of injustice—they\\nwill tell you) that the just man will be scourged, racked, bound, will\\nhave his eyes put out, and will at last be crucified (literally\\nimpaled)—and all this because he ought to have preferred seeming to\\nbeing. how different is the case of the unjust who clings to appearance\\nas the true reality! his high character makes him a ruler; he can marry\\nwhere he likes, trade where he likes, help his friends and hurt his\\nenemies; having got rich by dishonesty he can worship the gods better,\\nand will therefore be more loved by them than the just.’\\n\\ni was thinking what to answer, when adeimantus joined in the already\\nunequal fray. he considered that the most important point of all had\\nbeen omitted:—‘men are taught to be just for the sake of rewards;\\nparents and guardians make reputation the incentive to virtue. and\\nother advantages are promised by them of a more solid kind, such as\\nwealthy marriages and high offices. there are the pictures in homer and\\nhesiod of fat sheep and heavy fleeces, rich corn-fields and trees\\ntoppling with fruit, which the gods provide in this life for the just.\\nand the orphic poets add a similar picture of another. the heroes of\\nmusaeus and eumolpus lie on couches at a festival, with garlands on\\ntheir heads, enjoying as the meed of virtue a paradise of immortal\\ndrunkenness. some go further, and speak of a fair posterity in the\\nthird and fourth generation. but the wicked they bury in a slough and\\nmake them carry water in a sieve: and in this life they attribute to\\nthem the infamy which glaucon was assuming to be the lot of the just\\nwho are supposed to be unjust.\\n\\n‘take another kind of argument which is found both in poetry and\\nprose:—“virtue,” as hesiod says, “is honourable but difficult, vice is\\neasy and profitable.” you may often see the wicked in great prosperity\\nand the righteous afflicted by the will of heaven. and mendicant\\nprophets knock at rich men’s doors, promising to atone for the sins of\\nthemselves or their fathers in an easy fashion with sacrifices and\\nfestive games, or with charms and invocations to get rid of an enemy\\ngood or bad by divine help and at a small charge;—they appeal to books\\nprofessing to be written by musaeus and orpheus, and carry away the\\nminds of whole cities, and promise to “get souls out of purgatory;” and\\nif we refuse to listen to them, no one knows what will happen to us.\\n\\n‘when a lively-minded ingenuous youth hears all this, what will be his\\nconclusion? “will he,” in the language of pindar, “make justice his\\nhigh tower, or fortify himself with crooked deceit?” justice, he\\nreflects, without the appearance of justice, is misery and ruin;\\ninjustice has the promise of a glorious life. appearance is master of\\ntruth and lord of happiness. to appearance then i will turn,—i will put\\non the show of virtue and trail behind me the fox of archilochus. i\\nhear some one saying that “wickedness is not easily concealed,” to\\nwhich i reply that “nothing great is easy.” union and force and\\nrhetoric will do much; and if men say that they cannot prevail over the\\ngods, still how do we know that there are gods? only from the poets,\\nwho acknowledge that they may be appeased by sacrifices. then why not\\nsin and pay for indulgences out of your sin? for if the righteous are\\nonly unpunished, still they have no further reward, while the wicked\\nmay be unpunished and have the pleasure of sinning too. but what of the\\nworld below? nay, says the argument, there are atoning powers who will\\nset that matter right, as the poets, who are the sons of the gods, tell\\nus; and this is confirmed by the authority of the state.\\n\\n‘how can we resist such arguments in favour of injustice? add good\\nmanners, and, as the wise tell us, we shall make the best of both\\nworlds. who that is not a miserable caitiff will refrain from smiling\\nat the praises of justice? even if a man knows the better part he will\\nnot be angry with others; for he knows also that more than human virtue\\nis needed to save a man, and that he only praises justice who is\\nincapable of injustice.\\n\\n‘the origin of the evil is that all men from the beginning, heroes,\\npoets, instructors of youth, have always asserted “the temporal\\ndispensation,” the honours and profits of justice. had we been taught\\nin early youth the power of justice and injustice inherent in the soul,\\nand unseen by any human or divine eye, we should not have needed others\\nto be our guardians, but every one would have been the guardian of\\nhimself. this is what i want you to show, socrates;—other men use\\narguments which rather tend to strengthen the position of thrasymachus\\nthat “might is right;” but from you i expect better things. and please,\\nas glaucon said, to exclude reputation; let the just be thought unjust\\nand the unjust just, and do you still prove to us the superiority of\\njustice’...\\n\\nthe thesis, which for the sake of argument has been maintained by\\nglaucon, is the converse of that of thrasymachus—not right is the\\ninterest of the stronger, but right is the necessity of the weaker.\\nstarting from the same premises he carries the analysis of society a\\nstep further back;—might is still right, but the might is the weakness\\nof the many combined against the strength of the few.\\n\\nthere have been theories in modern as well as in ancient times which\\nhave a family likeness to the speculations of glaucon; e.g. that power\\nis the foundation of right; or that a monarch has a divine right to\\ngovern well or ill; or that virtue is self-love or the love of power;\\nor that war is the natural state of man; or that private vices are\\npublic benefits. all such theories have a kind of plausibility from\\ntheir partial agreement with experience. for human nature oscillates\\nbetween good and evil, and the motives of actions and the origin of\\ninstitutions may be explained to a certain extent on either hypothesis\\naccording to the character or point of view of a particular thinker.\\nthe obligation of maintaining authority under all circumstances and\\nsometimes by rather questionable means is felt strongly and has become\\na sort of instinct among civilized men. the divine right of kings, or\\nmore generally of governments, is one of the forms under which this\\nnatural feeling is expressed. nor again is there any evil which has not\\nsome accompaniment of good or pleasure; nor any good which is free from\\nsome alloy of evil; nor any noble or generous thought which may not be\\nattended by a shadow or the ghost of a shadow of self-interest or of\\nself-love. we know that all human actions are imperfect; but we do not\\ntherefore attribute them to the worse rather than to the better motive\\nor principle. such a philosophy is both foolish and false, like that\\nopinion of the clever rogue who assumes all other men to be like\\nhimself. and theories of this sort do not represent the real nature of\\nthe state, which is based on a vague sense of right gradually corrected\\nand enlarged by custom and law (although capable also of perversion),\\nany more than they describe the origin of society, which is to be\\nsought in the family and in the social and religious feelings of man.\\nnor do they represent the average character of individuals, which\\ncannot be explained simply on a theory of evil, but has always a\\ncounteracting element of good. and as men become better such theories\\nappear more and more untruthful to them, because they are more\\nconscious of their own disinterestedness. a little experience may make\\na man a cynic; a great deal will bring him back to a truer and kindlier\\nview of the mixed nature of himself and his fellow men.\\n\\nthe two brothers ask socrates to prove to them that the just is happy\\nwhen they have taken from him all that in which happiness is ordinarily\\nsupposed to consist. not that there is (1) any absurdity in the attempt\\nto frame a notion of justice apart from circumstances. for the ideal\\nmust always be a paradox when compared with the ordinary conditions of\\nhuman life. neither the stoical ideal nor the christian ideal is true\\nas a fact, but they may serve as a basis of education, and may exercise\\nan ennobling influence. an ideal is none the worse because ‘some one\\nhas made the discovery’ that no such ideal was ever realized. and in a\\nfew exceptional individuals who are raised above the ordinary level of\\nhumanity, the ideal of happiness may be realized in death and misery.\\nthis may be the state which the reason deliberately approves, and which\\nthe utilitarian as well as every other moralist may be bound in certain\\ncases to prefer.\\n\\nnor again, (2) must we forget that plato, though he agrees generally\\nwith the view implied in the argument of the two brothers, is not\\nexpressing his own final conclusion, but rather seeking to dramatize\\none of the aspects of ethical truth. he is developing his idea\\ngradually in a series of positions or situations. he is exhibiting\\nsocrates for the first time undergoing the socratic interrogation.\\nlastly, (3) the word ‘happiness’ involves some degree of confusion\\nbecause associated in the language of modern philosophy with conscious\\npleasure or satisfaction, which was not equally present to his mind.\\n\\nglaucon has been drawing a picture of the misery of the just and the\\nhappiness of the unjust, to which the misery of the tyrant in book ix\\nis the answer and parallel. and still the unjust must appear just; that\\nis ‘the homage which vice pays to virtue.’ but now adeimantus, taking\\nup the hint which had been already given by glaucon, proceeds to show\\nthat in the opinion of mankind justice is regarded only for the sake of\\nrewards and reputation, and points out the advantage which is given to\\nsuch arguments as those of thrasymachus and glaucon by the conventional\\nmorality of mankind. he seems to feel the difficulty of ‘justifying the\\nways of god to man.’ both the brothers touch upon the question, whether\\nthe morality of actions is determined by their consequences; and both\\nof them go beyond the position of socrates, that justice belongs to the\\nclass of goods not desirable for themselves only, but desirable for\\nthemselves and for their results, to which he recalls them. in their\\nattempt to view justice as an internal principle, and in their\\ncondemnation of the poets, they anticipate him. the common life of\\ngreece is not enough for them; they must penetrate deeper into the\\nnature of things.\\n\\nit has been objected that justice is honesty in the sense of glaucon\\nand adeimantus, but is taken by socrates to mean all virtue. may we not\\nmore truly say that the old-fashioned notion of justice is enlarged by\\nsocrates, and becomes equivalent to universal order or well-being,\\nfirst in the state, and secondly in the individual? he has found a new\\nanswer to his old question (protag.), ‘whether the virtues are one or\\nmany,’ viz. that one is the ordering principle of the three others. in\\nseeking to establish the purely internal nature of justice, he is met\\nby the fact that man is a social being, and he tries to harmonise the\\ntwo opposite theses as well as he can. there is no more inconsistency\\nin this than was inevitable in his age and country; there is no use in\\nturning upon him the cross lights of modern philosophy, which, from\\nsome other point of view, would appear equally inconsistent. plato does\\nnot give the final solution of philosophical questions for us; nor can\\nhe be judged of by our standard.\\n\\nthe remainder of the republic is developed out of the question of the\\nsons of ariston. three points are deserving of remark in what\\nimmediately follows:—first, that the answer of socrates is altogether\\nindirect. he does not say that happiness consists in the contemplation\\nof the idea of justice, and still less will he be tempted to affirm the\\nstoical paradox that the just man can be happy on the rack. but first\\nhe dwells on the difficulty of the problem and insists on restoring man\\nto his natural condition, before he will answer the question at all. he\\ntoo will frame an ideal, but his ideal comprehends not only abstract\\njustice, but the whole relations of man. under the fanciful\\nillustration of the large letters he implies that he will only look for\\njustice in society, and that from the state he will proceed to the\\nindividual. his answer in substance amounts to this,—that under\\nfavourable conditions, i.e. in the perfect state, justice and happiness\\nwill coincide, and that when justice has been once found, happiness may\\nbe left to take care of itself. that he falls into some degree of\\ninconsistency, when in the tenth book he claims to have got rid of the\\nrewards and honours of justice, may be admitted; for he has left those\\nwhich exist in the perfect state. and the philosopher ‘who retires\\nunder the shelter of a wall’ can hardly have been esteemed happy by\\nhim, at least not in this world. still he maintains the true attitude\\nof moral action. let a man do his duty first, without asking whether he\\nwill be happy or not, and happiness will be the inseparable accident\\nwhich attends him. ‘seek ye first the kingdom of god and his\\nrighteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.’\\n\\nsecondly, it may be remarked that plato preserves the genuine character\\nof greek thought in beginning with the state and in going on to the\\nindividual. first ethics, then politics—this is the order of ideas to\\nus; the reverse is the order of history. only after many struggles of\\nthought does the individual assert his right as a moral being. in early\\nages he is not one, but one of many, the citizen of a state which is\\nprior to him; and he has no notion of good or evil apart from the law\\nof his country or the creed of his church. and to this type he is\\nconstantly tending to revert, whenever the influence of custom, or of\\nparty spirit, or the recollection of the past becomes too strong for\\nhim.\\n\\nthirdly, we may observe the confusion or identification of the\\nindividual and the state, of ethics and politics, which pervades early\\ngreek speculation, and even in modern times retains a certain degree of\\ninfluence. the subtle difference between the collective and individual\\naction of mankind seems to have escaped early thinkers, and we too are\\nsometimes in danger of forgetting the conditions of united human\\naction, whenever we either elevate politics into ethics, or lower\\nethics to the standard of politics. the good man and the good citizen\\nonly coincide in the perfect state; and this perfection cannot be\\nattained by legislation acting upon them from without, but, if at all,\\nby education fashioning them from within.\\n\\n...socrates praises the sons of ariston, ‘inspired offspring of the\\nrenowned hero,’ as the elegiac poet terms them; but he does not\\nunderstand how they can argue so eloquently on behalf of injustice\\nwhile their character shows that they are uninfluenced by their own\\narguments. he knows not how to answer them, although he is afraid of\\ndeserting justice in the hour of need. he therefore makes a condition,\\nthat having weak eyes he shall be allowed to read the large letters\\nfirst and then go on to the smaller, that is, he must look for justice\\nin the state first, and will then proceed to the individual.\\naccordingly he begins to construct the state.\\n\\nsociety arises out of the wants of man. his first want is food; his\\nsecond a house; his third a coat. the sense of these needs and the\\npossibility of satisfying them by exchange, draw individuals together\\non the same spot; and this is the beginning of a state, which we take\\nthe liberty to invent, although necessity is the real inventor. there\\nmust be first a husbandman, secondly a builder, thirdly a weaver, to\\nwhich may be added a cobbler. four or five citizens at least are\\nrequired to make a city. now men have different natures, and one man\\nwill do one thing better than many; and business waits for no man.\\nhence there must be a division of labour into different employments;\\ninto wholesale and retail trade; into workers, and makers of workmen’s\\ntools; into shepherds and husbandmen. a city which includes all this\\nwill have far exceeded the limit of four or five, and yet not be very\\nlarge. but then again imports will be required, and imports necessitate\\nexports, and this implies variety of produce in order to attract the\\ntaste of purchasers; also merchants and ships. in the city too we must\\nhave a market and money and retail trades; otherwise buyers and sellers\\nwill never meet, and the valuable time of the producers will be wasted\\nin vain efforts at exchange. if we add hired servants the state will be\\ncomplete. and we may guess that somewhere in the intercourse of the\\ncitizens with one another justice and injustice will appear.\\n\\nhere follows a rustic picture of their way of life. they spend their\\ndays in houses which they have built for themselves; they make their\\nown clothes and produce their own corn and wine. their principal food\\nis meal and flour, and they drink in moderation. they live on the best\\nof terms with each other, and take care not to have too many children.\\n‘but,’ said glaucon, interposing, ‘are they not to have a relish?’\\ncertainly; they will have salt and olives and cheese, vegetables and\\nfruits, and chestnuts to roast at the fire. ‘’tis a city of pigs,\\nsocrates.’ why, i replied, what do you want more? ‘only the comforts of\\nlife,—sofas and tables, also sauces and sweets.’ i see; you want not\\nonly a state, but a luxurious state; and possibly in the more complex\\nframe we may sooner find justice and injustice. then the fine arts must\\ngo to work—every conceivable instrument and ornament of luxury will be\\nwanted. there will be dancers, painters, sculptors, musicians, cooks,\\nbarbers, tire-women, nurses, artists; swineherds and neatherds too for\\nthe animals, and physicians to cure the disorders of which luxury is\\nthe source. to feed all these superfluous mouths we shall need a part\\nof our neighbour’s land, and they will want a part of ours. and this is\\nthe origin of war, which may be traced to the same causes as other\\npolitical evils. our city will now require the slight addition of a\\ncamp, and the citizen will be converted into a soldier. but then again\\nour old doctrine of the division of labour must not be forgotten. the\\nart of war cannot be learned in a day, and there must be a natural\\naptitude for military duties. there will be some warlike natures who\\nhave this aptitude—dogs keen of scent, swift of foot to pursue, and\\nstrong of limb to fight. and as spirit is the foundation of courage,\\nsuch natures, whether of men or animals, will be full of spirit. but\\nthese spirited natures are apt to bite and devour one another; the\\nunion of gentleness to friends and fierceness against enemies appears\\nto be an impossibility, and the guardian of a state requires both\\nqualities. who then can be a guardian? the image of the dog suggests an\\nanswer. for dogs are gentle to friends and fierce to strangers. your\\ndog is a philosopher who judges by the rule of knowing or not knowing;\\nand philosophy, whether in man or beast, is the parent of gentleness.\\nthe human watchdogs must be philosophers or lovers of learning which\\nwill make them gentle. and how are they to be learned without\\neducation?\\n\\nbut what shall their education be? is any better than the old-fashioned\\nsort which is comprehended under the name of music and gymnastic? music\\nincludes literature, and literature is of two kinds, true and false.\\n‘what do you mean?’ he said. i mean that children hear stories before\\nthey learn gymnastics, and that the stories are either untrue, or have\\nat most one or two grains of truth in a bushel of falsehood. now early\\nlife is very impressible, and children ought not to learn what they\\nwill have to unlearn when they grow up; we must therefore have a\\ncensorship of nursery tales, banishing some and keeping others. some of\\nthem are very improper, as we may see in the great instances of homer\\nand hesiod, who not only tell lies but bad lies; stories about uranus\\nand saturn, which are immoral as well as false, and which should never\\nbe spoken of to young persons, or indeed at all; or, if at all, then in\\na mystery, after the sacrifice, not of an eleusinian pig, but of some\\nunprocurable animal. shall our youth be encouraged to beat their\\nfathers by the example of zeus, or our citizens be incited to quarrel\\nby hearing or seeing representations of strife among the gods? shall\\nthey listen to the narrative of hephaestus binding his mother, and of\\nzeus sending him flying for helping her when she was beaten? such tales\\nmay possibly have a mystical interpretation, but the young are\\nincapable of understanding allegory. if any one asks what tales are to\\nbe allowed, we will answer that we are legislators and not book-makers;\\nwe only lay down the principles according to which books are to be\\nwritten; to write them is the duty of others.\\n\\nand our first principle is, that god must be represented as he is; not\\nas the author of all things, but of good only. we will not suffer the\\npoets to say that he is the steward of good and evil, or that he has\\ntwo casks full of destinies;—or that athene and zeus incited pandarus\\nto break the treaty; or that god caused the sufferings of niobe, or of\\npelops, or the trojan war; or that he makes men sin when he wishes to\\ndestroy them. either these were not the actions of the gods, or god was\\njust, and men were the better for being punished. but that the deed was\\nevil, and god the author, is a wicked, suicidal fiction which we will\\nallow no one, old or young, to utter. this is our first and great\\nprinciple—god is the author of good only.\\n\\nand the second principle is like unto it:—with god is no variableness\\nor change of form. reason teaches us this; for if we suppose a change\\nin god, he must be changed either by another or by himself. by\\nanother?—but the best works of nature and art and the noblest qualities\\nof mind are least liable to be changed by any external force. by\\nhimself?—but he cannot change for the better; he will hardly change for\\nthe worse. he remains for ever fairest and best in his own image.\\ntherefore we refuse to listen to the poets who tell us of here begging\\nin the likeness of a priestess or of other deities who prowl about at\\nnight in strange disguises; all that blasphemous nonsense with which\\nmothers fool the manhood out of their children must be suppressed. but\\nsome one will say that god, who is himself unchangeable, may take a\\nform in relation to us. why should he? for gods as well as men hate the\\nlie in the soul, or principle of falsehood; and as for any other form\\nof lying which is used for a purpose and is regarded as innocent in\\ncertain exceptional cases—what need have the gods of this? for they are\\nnot ignorant of antiquity like the poets, nor are they afraid of their\\nenemies, nor is any madman a friend of theirs. god then is true, he is\\nabsolutely true; he changes not, he deceives not, by day or night, by\\nword or sign. this is our second great principle—god is true. away with\\nthe lying dream of agamemnon in homer, and the accusation of thetis\\nagainst apollo in aeschylus...\\n\\nin order to give clearness to his conception of the state, plato\\nproceeds to trace the first principles of mutual need and of division\\nof labour in an imaginary community of four or five citizens. gradually\\nthis community increases; the division of labour extends to countries;\\nimports necessitate exports; a medium of exchange is required, and\\nretailers sit in the market-place to save the time of the producers.\\nthese are the steps by which plato constructs the first or primitive\\nstate, introducing the elements of political economy by the way. as he\\nis going to frame a second or civilized state, the simple naturally\\ncomes before the complex. he indulges, like rousseau, in a picture of\\nprimitive life—an idea which has indeed often had a powerful influence\\non the imagination of mankind, but he does not seriously mean to say\\nthat one is better than the other (politicus); nor can any inference be\\ndrawn from the description of the first state taken apart from the\\nsecond, such as aristotle appears to draw in the politics. we should\\nnot interpret a platonic dialogue any more than a poem or a parable in\\ntoo literal or matter-of-fact a style. on the other hand, when we\\ncompare the lively fancy of plato with the dried-up abstractions of\\nmodern treatises on philosophy, we are compelled to say with\\nprotagoras, that the ‘mythus is more interesting’ (protag.)\\n\\nseveral interesting remarks which in modern times would have a place in\\na treatise on political economy are scattered up and down the writings\\nof plato: especially laws, population; free trade; adulteration; wills\\nand bequests; begging; eryxias, (though not plato’s), value and demand;\\nrepublic, division of labour. the last subject, and also the origin of\\nretail trade, is treated with admirable lucidity in the second book of\\nthe republic. but plato never combined his economic ideas into a\\nsystem, and never seems to have recognized that trade is one of the\\ngreat motive powers of the state and of the world. he would make retail\\ntraders only of the inferior sort of citizens (rep., laws), though he\\nremarks, quaintly enough (laws), that ‘if only the best men and the\\nbest women everywhere were compelled to keep taverns for a time or to\\ncarry on retail trade, etc., then we should knew how pleasant and\\nagreeable all these things are.’\\n\\nthe disappointment of glaucon at the ‘city of pigs,’ the ludicrous\\ndescription of the ministers of luxury in the more refined state, and\\nthe afterthought of the necessity of doctors, the illustration of the\\nnature of the guardian taken from the dog, the desirableness of\\noffering some almost unprocurable victim when impure mysteries are to\\nbe celebrated, the behaviour of zeus to his father and of hephaestus to\\nhis mother, are touches of humour which have also a serious meaning. in\\nspeaking of education plato rather startles us by affirming that a\\nchild must be trained in falsehood first and in truth afterwards. yet\\nthis is not very different from saying that children must be taught\\nthrough the medium of imagination as well as reason; that their minds\\ncan only develope gradually, and that there is much which they must\\nlearn without understanding. this is also the substance of plato’s\\nview, though he must be acknowledged to have drawn the line somewhat\\ndifferently from modern ethical writers, respecting truth and\\nfalsehood. to us, economies or accommodations would not be allowable\\nunless they were required by the human faculties or necessary for the\\ncommunication of knowledge to the simple and ignorant. we should insist\\nthat the word was inseparable from the intention, and that we must not\\nbe ‘falsely true,’ i.e. speak or act falsely in support of what was\\nright or true. but plato would limit the use of fictions only by\\nrequiring that they should have a good moral effect, and that such a\\ndangerous weapon as falsehood should be employed by the rulers alone\\nand for great objects.\\n\\na greek in the age of plato attached no importance to the question\\nwhether his religion was an historical fact. he was just beginning to\\nbe conscious that the past had a history; but he could see nothing\\nbeyond homer and hesiod. whether their narratives were true or false\\ndid not seriously affect the political or social life of hellas. men\\nonly began to suspect that they were fictions when they recognised them\\nto be immoral. and so in all religions: the consideration of their\\nmorality comes first, afterwards the truth of the documents in which\\nthey are recorded, or of the events natural or supernatural which are\\ntold of them. but in modern times, and in protestant countries perhaps\\nmore than in catholic, we have been too much inclined to identify the\\nhistorical with the moral; and some have refused to believe in religion\\nat all, unless a superhuman accuracy was discernible in every part of\\nthe record. the facts of an ancient or religious history are amongst\\nthe most important of all facts; but they are frequently uncertain, and\\nwe only learn the true lesson which is to be gathered from them when we\\nplace ourselves above them. these reflections tend to show that the\\ndifference between plato and ourselves, though not unimportant, is not\\nso great as might at first sight appear. for we should agree with him\\nin placing the moral before the historical truth of religion; and,\\ngenerally, in disregarding those errors or misstatements of fact which\\nnecessarily occur in the early stages of all religions. we know also\\nthat changes in the traditions of a country cannot be made in a day;\\nand are therefore tolerant of many things which science and criticism\\nwould condemn.\\n\\nwe note in passing that the allegorical interpretation of mythology,\\nsaid to have been first introduced as early as the sixth century before\\nchrist by theagenes of rhegium, was well established in the age of\\nplato, and here, as in the phaedrus, though for a different reason, was\\nrejected by him. that anachronisms whether of religion or law, when men\\nhave reached another stage of civilization, should be got rid of by\\nfictions is in accordance with universal experience. great is the art\\nof interpretation; and by a natural process, which when once discovered\\nwas always going on, what could not be altered was explained away. and\\nso without any palpable inconsistency there existed side by side two\\nforms of religion, the tradition inherited or invented by the poets and\\nthe customary worship of the temple; on the other hand, there was the\\nreligion of the philosopher, who was dwelling in the heaven of ideas,\\nbut did not therefore refuse to offer a cock to aesculapius, or to be\\nseen saying his prayers at the rising of the sun. at length the\\nantagonism between the popular and philosophical religion, never so\\ngreat among the greeks as in our own age, disappeared, and was only\\nfelt like the difference between the religion of the educated and\\nuneducated among ourselves. the zeus of homer and hesiod easily passed\\ninto the ‘royal mind’ of plato (philebus); the giant heracles became\\nthe knight-errant and benefactor of mankind. these and still more\\nwonderful transformations were readily effected by the ingenuity of\\nstoics and neo-platonists in the two or three centuries before and\\nafter christ. the greek and roman religions were gradually permeated by\\nthe spirit of philosophy; having lost their ancient meaning, they were\\nresolved into poetry and morality; and probably were never purer than\\nat the time of their decay, when their influence over the world was\\nwaning.\\n\\na singular conception which occurs towards the end of the book is the\\nlie in the soul; this is connected with the platonic and socratic\\ndoctrine that involuntary ignorance is worse than voluntary. the lie in\\nthe soul is a true lie, the corruption of the highest truth, the\\ndeception of the highest part of the soul, from which he who is\\ndeceived has no power of delivering himself. for example, to represent\\ngod as false or immoral, or, according to plato, as deluding men with\\nappearances or as the author of evil; or again, to affirm with\\nprotagoras that ‘knowledge is sensation,’ or that ‘being is becoming,’\\nor with thrasymachus ‘that might is right,’ would have been regarded by\\nplato as a lie of this hateful sort. the greatest unconsciousness of\\nthe greatest untruth, e.g. if, in the language of the gospels (john),\\n‘he who was blind’ were to say ‘i see,’ is another aspect of the state\\nof mind which plato is describing. the lie in the soul may be further\\ncompared with the sin against the holy ghost (luke), allowing for the\\ndifference between greek and christian modes of speaking. to this is\\nopposed the lie in words, which is only such a deception as may occur\\nin a play or poem, or allegory or figure of speech, or in any sort of\\naccommodation,—which though useless to the gods may be useful to men in\\ncertain cases. socrates is here answering the question which he had\\nhimself raised about the propriety of deceiving a madman; and he is\\nalso contrasting the nature of god and man. for god is truth, but\\nmankind can only be true by appearing sometimes to be partial, or\\nfalse. reserving for another place the greater questions of religion or\\neducation, we may note further, (1) the approval of the old traditional\\neducation of greece; (2) the preparation which plato is making for the\\nattack on homer and the poets; (3) the preparation which he is also\\nmaking for the use of economies in the state; (4) the contemptuous and\\nat the same time euphemistic manner in which here as below he alludes\\nto the ‘chronique scandaleuse’ of the gods.\\n\\nbook iii. there is another motive in purifying religion, which is to\\nbanish fear; for no man can be courageous who is afraid of death, or\\nwho believes the tales which are repeated by the poets concerning the\\nworld below. they must be gently requested not to abuse hell; they may\\nbe reminded that their stories are both untrue and discouraging. nor\\nmust they be angry if we expunge obnoxious passages, such as the\\ndepressing words of achilles—‘i would rather be a serving-man than rule\\nover all the dead;’ and the verses which tell of the squalid mansions,\\nthe senseless shadows, the flitting soul mourning over lost strength\\nand youth, the soul with a gibber going beneath the earth like smoke,\\nor the souls of the suitors which flutter about like bats. the terrors\\nand horrors of cocytus and styx, ghosts and sapless shades, and the\\nrest of their tartarean nomenclature, must vanish. such tales may have\\ntheir use; but they are not the proper food for soldiers. as little can\\nwe admit the sorrows and sympathies of the homeric heroes:—achilles,\\nthe son of thetis, in tears, throwing ashes on his head, or pacing up\\nand down the sea-shore in distraction; or priam, the cousin of the\\ngods, crying aloud, rolling in the mire. a good man is not prostrated\\nat the loss of children or fortune. neither is death terrible to him;\\nand therefore lamentations over the dead should not be practised by men\\nof note; they should be the concern of inferior persons only, whether\\nwomen or men. still worse is the attribution of such weakness to the\\ngods; as when the goddesses say, ‘alas! my travail!’ and worst of all,\\nwhen the king of heaven himself laments his inability to save hector,\\nor sorrows over the impending doom of his dear sarpedon. such a\\ncharacter of god, if not ridiculed by our young men, is likely to be\\nimitated by them. nor should our citizens be given to excess of\\nlaughter—‘such violent delights’ are followed by a violent re-action.\\nthe description in the iliad of the gods shaking their sides at the\\nclumsiness of hephaestus will not be admitted by us. ‘certainly not.’\\n\\ntruth should have a high place among the virtues, for falsehood, as we\\nwere saying, is useless to the gods, and only useful to men as a\\nmedicine. but this employment of falsehood must remain a privilege of\\nstate; the common man must not in return tell a lie to the ruler; any\\nmore than the patient would tell a lie to his physician, or the sailor\\nto his captain.\\n\\nin the next place our youth must be temperate, and temperance consists\\nin self-control and obedience to authority. that is a lesson which\\nhomer teaches in some places: ‘the achaeans marched on breathing\\nprowess, in silent awe of their leaders;’—but a very different one in\\nother places: ‘o heavy with wine, who hast the eyes of a dog, but the\\nheart of a stag.’ language of the latter kind will not impress\\nself-control on the minds of youth. the same may be said about his\\npraises of eating and drinking and his dread of starvation; also about\\nthe verses in which he tells of the rapturous loves of zeus and here,\\nor of how hephaestus once detained ares and aphrodite in a net on a\\nsimilar occasion. there is a nobler strain heard in the words:—‘endure,\\nmy soul, thou hast endured worse.’ nor must we allow our citizens to\\nreceive bribes, or to say, ‘gifts persuade the gods, gifts reverend\\nkings;’ or to applaud the ignoble advice of phoenix to achilles that he\\nshould get money out of the greeks before he assisted them; or the\\nmeanness of achilles himself in taking gifts from agamemnon; or his\\nrequiring a ransom for the body of hector; or his cursing of apollo; or\\nhis insolence to the river-god scamander; or his dedication to the dead\\npatroclus of his own hair which had been already dedicated to the other\\nriver-god spercheius; or his cruelty in dragging the body of hector\\nround the walls, and slaying the captives at the pyre: such a\\ncombination of meanness and cruelty in cheiron’s pupil is\\ninconceivable. the amatory exploits of peirithous and theseus are\\nequally unworthy. either these so-called sons of gods were not the sons\\nof gods, or they were not such as the poets imagine them, any more than\\nthe gods themselves are the authors of evil. the youth who believes\\nthat such things are done by those who have the blood of heaven flowing\\nin their veins will be too ready to imitate their example.\\n\\nenough of gods and heroes;—what shall we say about men? what the poets\\nand story-tellers say—that the wicked prosper and the righteous are\\nafflicted, or that justice is another’s gain? such misrepresentations\\ncannot be allowed by us. but in this we are anticipating the definition\\nof justice, and had therefore better defer the enquiry.\\n\\nthe subjects of poetry have been sufficiently treated; next follows\\nstyle. now all poetry is a narrative of events past, present, or to\\ncome; and narrative is of three kinds, the simple, the imitative, and a\\ncomposition of the two. an instance will make my meaning clear. the\\nfirst scene in homer is of the last or mixed kind, being partly\\ndescription and partly dialogue. but if you throw the dialogue into the\\n‘oratio obliqua,’ the passage will run thus: the priest came and prayed\\napollo that the achaeans might take troy and have a safe return if\\nagamemnon would only give him back his daughter; and the other greeks\\nassented, but agamemnon was wroth, and so on—the whole then becomes\\ndescriptive, and the poet is the only speaker left; or, if you omit the\\nnarrative, the whole becomes dialogue. these are the three styles—which\\nof them is to be admitted into our state? ‘do you ask whether tragedy\\nand comedy are to be admitted?’ yes, but also something more—is it not\\ndoubtful whether our guardians are to be imitators at all? or rather,\\nhas not the question been already answered, for we have decided that\\none man cannot in his life play many parts, any more than he can act\\nboth tragedy and comedy, or be rhapsodist and actor at once? human\\nnature is coined into very small pieces, and as our guardians have\\ntheir own business already, which is the care of freedom, they will\\nhave enough to do without imitating. if they imitate they should\\nimitate, not any meanness or baseness, but the good only; for the mask\\nwhich the actor wears is apt to become his face. we cannot allow men to\\nplay the parts of women, quarrelling, weeping, scolding, or boasting\\nagainst the gods,—least of all when making love or in labour. they must\\nnot represent slaves, or bullies, or cowards, drunkards, or madmen, or\\nblacksmiths, or neighing horses, or bellowing bulls, or sounding\\nrivers, or a raging sea. a good or wise man will be willing to perform\\ngood and wise actions, but he will be ashamed to play an inferior part\\nwhich he has never practised; and he will prefer to employ the\\ndescriptive style with as little imitation as possible. the man who has\\nno self-respect, on the contrary, will imitate anybody and anything;\\nsounds of nature and cries of animals alike; his whole performance will\\nbe imitation of gesture and voice. now in the descriptive style there\\nare few changes, but in the dramatic there are a great many. poets and\\nmusicians use either, or a compound of both, and this compound is very\\nattractive to youth and their teachers as well as to the vulgar. but\\nour state in which one man plays one part only is not adapted for\\ncomplexity. and when one of these polyphonous pantomimic gentlemen\\noffers to exhibit himself and his poetry we will show him every\\nobservance of respect, but at the same time tell him that there is no\\nroom for his kind in our state; we prefer the rough, honest poet, and\\nwill not depart from our original models (laws).\\n\\nnext as to the music. a song or ode has three parts,—the subject, the\\nharmony, and the rhythm; of which the two last are dependent upon the\\nfirst. as we banished strains of lamentation, so we may now banish the\\nmixed lydian harmonies, which are the harmonies of lamentation; and as\\nour citizens are to be temperate, we may also banish convivial\\nharmonies, such as the ionian and pure lydian. two remain—the dorian\\nand phrygian, the first for war, the second for peace; the one\\nexpressive of courage, the other of obedience or instruction or\\nreligious feeling. and as we reject varieties of harmony, we shall also\\nreject the many-stringed, variously-shaped instruments which give\\nutterance to them, and in particular the flute, which is more complex\\nthan any of them. the lyre and the harp may be permitted in the town,\\nand the pan’s-pipe in the fields. thus we have made a purgation of\\nmusic, and will now make a purgation of metres. these should be like\\nthe harmonies, simple and suitable to the occasion. there are four\\nnotes of the tetrachord, and there are three ratios of metre, 3/2, 2/2,\\n2/1, which have all their characteristics, and the feet have different\\ncharacteristics as well as the rhythms. but about this you and i must\\nask damon, the great musician, who speaks, if i remember rightly, of a\\nmartial measure as well as of dactylic, trochaic, and iambic rhythms,\\nwhich he arranges so as to equalize the syllables with one another,\\nassigning to each the proper quantity. we only venture to affirm the\\ngeneral principle that the style is to conform to the subject and the\\nmetre to the style; and that the simplicity and harmony of the soul\\nshould be reflected in them all. this principle of simplicity has to be\\nlearnt by every one in the days of his youth, and may be gathered\\nanywhere, from the creative and constructive arts, as well as from the\\nforms of plants and animals.\\n\\nother artists as well as poets should be warned against meanness or\\nunseemliness. sculpture and painting equally with music must conform to\\nthe law of simplicity. he who violates it cannot be allowed to work in\\nour city, and to corrupt the taste of our citizens. for our guardians\\nmust grow up, not amid images of deformity which will gradually poison\\nand corrupt their souls, but in a land of health and beauty where they\\nwill drink in from every object sweet and harmonious influences. and of\\nall these influences the greatest is the education given by music,\\nwhich finds a way into the innermost soul and imparts to it the sense\\nof beauty and of deformity. at first the effect is unconscious; but\\nwhen reason arrives, then he who has been thus trained welcomes her as\\nthe friend whom he always knew. as in learning to read, first we\\nacquire the elements or letters separately, and afterwards their\\ncombinations, and cannot recognize reflections of them until we know\\nthe letters themselves;—in like manner we must first attain the\\nelements or essential forms of the virtues, and then trace their\\ncombinations in life and experience. there is a music of the soul which\\nanswers to the harmony of the world; and the fairest object of a\\nmusical soul is the fair mind in the fair body. some defect in the\\nlatter may be excused, but not in the former. true love is the daughter\\nof temperance, and temperance is utterly opposed to the madness of\\nbodily pleasure. enough has been said of music, which makes a fair\\nending with love.\\n\\nnext we pass on to gymnastics; about which i would remark, that the\\nsoul is related to the body as a cause to an effect, and therefore if\\nwe educate the mind we may leave the education of the body in her\\ncharge, and need only give a general outline of the course to be\\npursued. in the first place the guardians must abstain from strong\\ndrink, for they should be the last persons to lose their wits. whether\\nthe habits of the palaestra are suitable to them is more doubtful, for\\nthe ordinary gymnastic is a sleepy sort of thing, and if left off\\nsuddenly is apt to endanger health. but our warrior athletes must be\\nwide-awake dogs, and must also be inured to all changes of food and\\nclimate. hence they will require a simpler kind of gymnastic, akin to\\ntheir simple music; and for their diet a rule may be found in homer,\\nwho feeds his heroes on roast meat only, and gives them no fish\\nalthough they are living at the sea-side, nor boiled meats which\\ninvolve an apparatus of pots and pans; and, if i am not mistaken, he\\nnowhere mentions sweet sauces. sicilian cookery and attic confections\\nand corinthian courtezans, which are to gymnastic what lydian and\\nionian melodies are to music, must be forbidden. where gluttony and\\nintemperance prevail the town quickly fills with doctors and pleaders;\\nand law and medicine give themselves airs as soon as the freemen of a\\nstate take an interest in them. but what can show a more disgraceful\\nstate of education than to have to go abroad for justice because you\\nhave none of your own at home? and yet there is a worse stage of the\\nsame disease—when men have learned to take a pleasure and pride in the\\ntwists and turns of the law; not considering how much better it would\\nbe for them so to order their lives as to have no need of a nodding\\njustice. and there is a like disgrace in employing a physician, not for\\nthe cure of wounds or epidemic disorders, but because a man has by\\nlaziness and luxury contracted diseases which were unknown in the days\\nof asclepius. how simple is the homeric practice of medicine. eurypylus\\nafter he has been wounded drinks a posset of pramnian wine, which is of\\na heating nature; and yet the sons of asclepius blame neither the\\ndamsel who gives him the drink, nor patroclus who is attending on him.\\nthe truth is that this modern system of nursing diseases was introduced\\nby herodicus the trainer; who, being of a sickly constitution, by a\\ncompound of training and medicine tortured first himself and then a\\ngood many other people, and lived a great deal longer than he had any\\nright. but asclepius would not practise this art, because he knew that\\nthe citizens of a well-ordered state have no leisure to be ill, and\\ntherefore he adopted the ‘kill or cure’ method, which artisans and\\nlabourers employ. ‘they must be at their business,’ they say, ‘and have\\nno time for coddling: if they recover, well; if they don’t, there is an\\nend of them.’ whereas the rich man is supposed to be a gentleman who\\ncan afford to be ill. do you know a maxim of phocylides—that ‘when a\\nman begins to be rich’ (or, perhaps, a little sooner) ‘he should\\npractise virtue’? but how can excessive care of health be inconsistent\\nwith an ordinary occupation, and yet consistent with that practice of\\nvirtue which phocylides inculcates? when a student imagines that\\nphilosophy gives him a headache, he never does anything; he is always\\nunwell. this was the reason why asclepius and his sons practised no\\nsuch art. they were acting in the interest of the public, and did not\\nwish to preserve useless lives, or raise up a puny offspring to\\nwretched sires. honest diseases they honestly cured; and if a man was\\nwounded, they applied the proper remedies, and then let him eat and\\ndrink what he liked. but they declined to treat intemperate and\\nworthless subjects, even though they might have made large fortunes out\\nof them. as to the story of pindar, that asclepius was slain by a\\nthunderbolt for restoring a rich man to life, that is a lie—following\\nour old rule we must say either that he did not take bribes, or that he\\nwas not the son of a god.\\n\\nglaucon then asks socrates whether the best physicians and the best\\njudges will not be those who have had severally the greatest experience\\nof diseases and of crimes. socrates draws a distinction between the two\\nprofessions. the physician should have had experience of disease in his\\nown body, for he cures with his mind and not with his body. but the\\njudge controls mind by mind; and therefore his mind should not be\\ncorrupted by crime. where then is he to gain experience? how is he to\\nbe wise and also innocent? when young a good man is apt to be deceived\\nby evil-doers, because he has no pattern of evil in himself; and\\ntherefore the judge should be of a certain age; his youth should have\\nbeen innocent, and he should have acquired insight into evil not by the\\npractice of it, but by the observation of it in others. this is the\\nideal of a judge; the criminal turned detective is wonderfully\\nsuspicious, but when in company with good men who have experience, he\\nis at fault, for he foolishly imagines that every one is as bad as\\nhimself. vice may be known of virtue, but cannot know virtue. this is\\nthe sort of medicine and this the sort of law which will prevail in our\\nstate; they will be healing arts to better natures; but the evil body\\nwill be left to die by the one, and the evil soul will be put to death\\nby the other. and the need of either will be greatly diminished by good\\nmusic which will give harmony to the soul, and good gymnastic which\\nwill give health to the body. not that this division of music and\\ngymnastic really corresponds to soul and body; for they are both\\nequally concerned with the soul, which is tamed by the one and aroused\\nand sustained by the other. the two together supply our guardians with\\ntheir twofold nature. the passionate disposition when it has too much\\ngymnastic is hardened and brutalized, the gentle or philosophic temper\\nwhich has too much music becomes enervated. while a man is allowing\\nmusic to pour like water through the funnel of his ears, the edge of\\nhis soul gradually wears away, and the passionate or spirited element\\nis melted out of him. too little spirit is easily exhausted; too much\\nquickly passes into nervous irritability. so, again, the athlete by\\nfeeding and training has his courage doubled, but he soon grows stupid;\\nhe is like a wild beast, ready to do everything by blows and nothing by\\ncounsel or policy. there are two principles in man, reason and passion,\\nand to these, not to the soul and body, the two arts of music and\\ngymnastic correspond. he who mingles them in harmonious concord is the\\ntrue musician,—he shall be the presiding genius of our state.\\n\\nthe next question is, who are to be our rulers? first, the elder must\\nrule the younger; and the best of the elders will be the best\\nguardians. now they will be the best who love their subjects most, and\\nthink that they have a common interest with them in the welfare of the\\nstate. these we must select; but they must be watched at every epoch of\\nlife to see whether they have retained the same opinions and held out\\nagainst force and enchantment. for time and persuasion and the love of\\npleasure may enchant a man into a change of purpose, and the force of\\ngrief and pain may compel him. and therefore our guardians must be men\\nwho have been tried by many tests, like gold in the refiner’s fire, and\\nhave been passed first through danger, then through pleasure, and at\\nevery age have come out of such trials victorious and without stain, in\\nfull command of themselves and their principles; having all their\\nfaculties in harmonious exercise for their country’s good. these shall\\nreceive the highest honours both in life and death. (it would perhaps\\nbe better to confine the term ‘guardians’ to this select class: the\\nyounger men may be called ‘auxiliaries.’)\\n\\nand now for one magnificent lie, in the belief of which, oh that we\\ncould train our rulers!—at any rate let us make the attempt with the\\nrest of the world. what i am going to tell is only another version of\\nthe legend of cadmus; but our unbelieving generation will be slow to\\naccept such a story. the tale must be imparted, first to the rulers,\\nthen to the soldiers, lastly to the people. we will inform them that\\ntheir youth was a dream, and that during the time when they seemed to\\nbe undergoing their education they were really being fashioned in the\\nearth, who sent them up when they were ready; and that they must\\nprotect and cherish her whose children they are, and regard each other\\nas brothers and sisters. ‘i do not wonder at your being ashamed to\\npropound such a fiction.’ there is more behind. these brothers and\\nsisters have different natures, and some of them god framed to rule,\\nwhom he fashioned of gold; others he made of silver, to be auxiliaries;\\nothers again to be husbandmen and craftsmen, and these were formed by\\nhim of brass and iron. but as they are all sprung from a common stock,\\na golden parent may have a silver son, or a silver parent a golden son,\\nand then there must be a change of rank; the son of the rich must\\ndescend, and the child of the artisan rise, in the social scale; for an\\noracle says ‘that the state will come to an end if governed by a man of\\nbrass or iron.’ will our citizens ever believe all this? ‘not in the\\npresent generation, but in the next, perhaps, yes.’\\n\\nnow let the earthborn men go forth under the command of their rulers,\\nand look about and pitch their camp in a high place, which will be safe\\nagainst enemies from without, and likewise against insurrections from\\nwithin. there let them sacrifice and set up their tents; for soldiers\\nthey are to be and not shopkeepers, the watchdogs and guardians of the\\nsheep; and luxury and avarice will turn them into wolves and tyrants.\\ntheir habits and their dwellings should correspond to their education.\\nthey should have no property; their pay should only meet their\\nexpenses; and they should have common meals. gold and silver we will\\ntell them that they have from god, and this divine gift in their souls\\nthey must not alloy with that earthly dross which passes under the name\\nof gold. they only of the citizens may not touch it, or be under the\\nsame roof with it, or drink from it; it is the accursed thing. should\\nthey ever acquire houses or lands or money of their own, they will\\nbecome householders and tradesmen instead of guardians, enemies and\\ntyrants instead of helpers, and the hour of ruin, both to themselves\\nand the rest of the state, will be at hand.\\n\\nthe religious and ethical aspect of plato’s education will hereafter be\\nconsidered under a separate head. some lesser points may be more\\nconveniently noticed in this place.\\n\\n1. the constant appeal to the authority of homer, whom, with grave\\nirony, plato, after the manner of his age, summons as a witness about\\nethics and psychology, as well as about diet and medicine; attempting\\nto distinguish the better lesson from the worse, sometimes altering the\\ntext from design; more than once quoting or alluding to homer\\ninaccurately, after the manner of the early logographers turning the\\niliad into prose, and delighting to draw far-fetched inferences from\\nhis words, or to make ludicrous applications of them. he does not, like\\nheracleitus, get into a rage with homer and archilochus (heracl.), but\\nuses their words and expressions as vehicles of a higher truth; not on\\na system like theagenes of rhegium or metrodorus, or in later times the\\nstoics, but as fancy may dictate. and the conclusions drawn from them\\nare sound, although the premises are fictitious. these fanciful appeals\\nto homer add a charm to plato’s style, and at the same time they have\\nthe effect of a satire on the follies of homeric interpretation. to us\\n(and probably to himself), although they take the form of arguments,\\nthey are really figures of speech. they may be compared with modern\\ncitations from scripture, which have often a great rhetorical power\\neven when the original meaning of the words is entirely lost sight of.\\nthe real, like the platonic socrates, as we gather from the memorabilia\\nof xenophon, was fond of making similar adaptations. great in all ages\\nand countries, in religion as well as in law and literature, has been\\nthe art of interpretation.\\n\\n2. ‘the style is to conform to the subject and the metre to the style.’\\nnotwithstanding the fascination which the word ‘classical’ exercises\\nover us, we can hardly maintain that this rule is observed in all the\\ngreek poetry which has come down to us. we cannot deny that the thought\\noften exceeds the power of lucid expression in aeschylus and pindar; or\\nthat rhetoric gets the better of the thought in the sophist-poet\\neuripides. only perhaps in sophocles is there a perfect harmony of the\\ntwo; in him alone do we find a grace of language like the beauty of a\\ngreek statue, in which there is nothing to add or to take away; at\\nleast this is true of single plays or of large portions of them. the\\nconnection in the tragic choruses and in the greek lyric poets is not\\nunfrequently a tangled thread which in an age before logic the poet was\\nunable to draw out. many thoughts and feelings mingled in his mind, and\\nhe had no power of disengaging or arranging them. for there is a subtle\\ninfluence of logic which requires to be transferred from prose to\\npoetry, just as the music and perfection of language are infused by\\npoetry into prose. in all ages the poet has been a bad judge of his own\\nmeaning (apol.); for he does not see that the word which is full of\\nassociations to his own mind is difficult and unmeaning to that of\\nanother; or that the sequence which is clear to himself is puzzling to\\nothers. there are many passages in some of our greatest modern poets\\nwhich are far too obscure; in which there is no proportion between\\nstyle and subject, in which any half-expressed figure, any harsh\\nconstruction, any distorted collocation of words, any remote sequence\\nof ideas is admitted; and there is no voice ‘coming sweetly from\\nnature,’ or music adding the expression of feeling to thought. as if\\nthere could be poetry without beauty, or beauty without ease and\\nclearness. the obscurities of early greek poets arose necessarily out\\nof the state of language and logic which existed in their age. they are\\nnot examples to be followed by us; for the use of language ought in\\nevery generation to become clearer and clearer. like shakespere, they\\nwere great in spite, not in consequence, of their imperfections of\\nexpression. but there is no reason for returning to the necessary\\nobscurity which prevailed in the infancy of literature. the english\\npoets of the last century were certainly not obscure; and we have no\\nexcuse for losing what they had gained, or for going back to the\\nearlier or transitional age which preceded them. the thought of our own\\ntimes has not out-stripped language; a want of plato’s ‘art of\\nmeasuring’ is the rule cause of the disproportion between them.\\n\\n3. in the third book of the republic a nearer approach is made to a\\ntheory of art than anywhere else in plato. his views may be summed up\\nas follows:—true art is not fanciful and imitative, but simple and\\nideal,—the expression of the highest moral energy, whether in action or\\nrepose. to live among works of plastic art which are of this noble and\\nsimple character, or to listen to such strains, is the best of\\ninfluences,—the true greek atmosphere, in which youth should be brought\\nup. that is the way to create in them a natural good taste, which will\\nhave a feeling of truth and beauty in all things. for though the poets\\nare to be expelled, still art is recognized as another aspect of\\nreason—like love in the symposium, extending over the same sphere, but\\nconfined to the preliminary education, and acting through the power of\\nhabit; and this conception of art is not limited to strains of music or\\nthe forms of plastic art, but pervades all nature and has a wide\\nkindred in the world. the republic of plato, like the athens of\\npericles, has an artistic as well as a political side.\\n\\nthere is hardly any mention in plato of the creative arts; only in two\\nor three passages does he even allude to them (rep.; soph.). he is not\\nlost in rapture at the great works of phidias, the parthenon, the\\npropylea, the statues of zeus or athene. he would probably have\\nregarded any abstract truth of number or figure as higher than the\\ngreatest of them. yet it is hard to suppose that some influence, such\\nas he hopes to inspire in youth, did not pass into his own mind from\\nthe works of art which he saw around him. we are living upon the\\nfragments of them, and find in a few broken stones the standard of\\ntruth and beauty. but in plato this feeling has no expression; he\\nnowhere says that beauty is the object of art; he seems to deny that\\nwisdom can take an external form (phaedrus); he does not distinguish\\nthe fine from the mechanical arts. whether or no, like some writers, he\\nfelt more than he expressed, it is at any rate remarkable that the\\ngreatest perfection of the fine arts should coincide with an almost\\nentire silence about them. in one very striking passage he tells us\\nthat a work of art, like the state, is a whole; and this conception of\\na whole and the love of the newly-born mathematical sciences may be\\nregarded, if not as the inspiring, at any rate as the regulating\\nprinciples of greek art (xen. mem.; and sophist).\\n\\n4. plato makes the true and subtle remark that the physician had better\\nnot be in robust health; and should have known what illness is in his\\nown person. but the judge ought to have had no similar experience of\\nevil; he is to be a good man who, having passed his youth in innocence,\\nbecame acquainted late in life with the vices of others. and therefore,\\naccording to plato, a judge should not be young, just as a young man\\naccording to aristotle is not fit to be a hearer of moral philosophy.\\nthe bad, on the other hand, have a knowledge of vice, but no knowledge\\nof virtue. it may be doubted, however, whether this train of reflection\\nis well founded. in a remarkable passage of the laws it is acknowledged\\nthat the evil may form a correct estimate of the good. the union of\\ngentleness and courage in book ii. at first seemed to be a paradox, yet\\nwas afterwards ascertained to be a truth. and plato might also have\\nfound that the intuition of evil may be consistent with the abhorrence\\nof it. there is a directness of aim in virtue which gives an insight\\ninto vice. and the knowledge of character is in some degree a natural\\nsense independent of any special experience of good or evil.\\n\\n5. one of the most remarkable conceptions of plato, because un-greek\\nand also very different from anything which existed at all in his age\\nof the world, is the transposition of ranks. in the spartan state there\\nhad been enfranchisement of helots and degradation of citizens under\\nspecial circumstances. and in the ancient greek aristocracies, merit\\nwas certainly recognized as one of the elements on which government was\\nbased. the founders of states were supposed to be their benefactors,\\nwho were raised by their great actions above the ordinary level of\\nhumanity; at a later period, the services of warriors and legislators\\nwere held to entitle them and their descendants to the privileges of\\ncitizenship and to the first rank in the state. and although the\\nexistence of an ideal aristocracy is slenderly proven from the remains\\nof early greek history, and we have a difficulty in ascribing such a\\ncharacter, however the idea may be defined, to any actual hellenic\\nstate—or indeed to any state which has ever existed in the world—still\\nthe rule of the best was certainly the aspiration of philosophers, who\\nprobably accommodated a good deal their views of primitive history to\\ntheir own notions of good government. plato further insists on applying\\nto the guardians of his state a series of tests by which all those who\\nfell short of a fixed standard were either removed from the governing\\nbody, or not admitted to it; and this ‘academic’ discipline did to a\\ncertain extent prevail in greek states, especially in sparta. he also\\nindicates that the system of caste, which existed in a great part of\\nthe ancient, and is by no means extinct in the modern european world,\\nshould be set aside from time to time in favour of merit. he is aware\\nhow deeply the greater part of mankind resent any interference with the\\norder of society, and therefore he proposes his novel idea in the form\\nof what he himself calls a ‘monstrous fiction.’ (compare the ceremony\\nof preparation for the two ‘great waves’ in book v.) two principles are\\nindicated by him: first, that there is a distinction of ranks dependent\\non circumstances prior to the individual: second, that this distinction\\nis and ought to be broken through by personal qualities. he adapts\\nmythology like the homeric poems to the wants of the state, making ‘the\\nphoenician tale’ the vehicle of his ideas. every greek state had a myth\\nrespecting its own origin; the platonic republic may also have a tale\\nof earthborn men. the gravity and verisimilitude with which the tale is\\ntold, and the analogy of greek tradition, are a sufficient verification\\nof the ‘monstrous falsehood.’ ancient poetry had spoken of a gold and\\nsilver and brass and iron age succeeding one another, but plato\\nsupposes these differences in the natures of men to exist together in a\\nsingle state. mythology supplies a figure under which the lesson may be\\ntaught (as protagoras says, ‘the myth is more interesting’), and also\\nenables plato to touch lightly on new principles without going into\\ndetails. in this passage he shadows forth a general truth, but he does\\nnot tell us by what steps the transposition of ranks is to be effected.\\nindeed throughout the republic he allows the lower ranks to fade into\\nthe distance. we do not know whether they are to carry arms, and\\nwhether in the fifth book they are or are not included in the\\ncommunistic regulations respecting property and marriage. nor is there\\nany use in arguing strictly either from a few chance words, or from the\\nsilence of plato, or in drawing inferences which were beyond his\\nvision. aristotle, in his criticism on the position of the lower\\nclasses, does not perceive that the poetical creation is ‘like the air,\\ninvulnerable,’ and cannot be penetrated by the shafts of his logic\\n(pol.).\\n\\n6. two paradoxes which strike the modern reader as in the highest\\ndegree fanciful and ideal, and which suggest to him many reflections,\\nare to be found in the third book of the republic: first, the great\\npower of music, so much beyond any influence which is experienced by us\\nin modern times, when the art or science has been far more developed,\\nand has found the secret of harmony, as well as of melody; secondly,\\nthe indefinite and almost absolute control which the soul is supposed\\nto exercise over the body.\\n\\nin the first we suspect some degree of exaggeration, such as we may\\nalso observe among certain masters of the art, not unknown to us, at\\nthe present day. with this natural enthusiasm, which is felt by a few\\nonly, there seems to mingle in plato a sort of pythagorean reverence\\nfor numbers and numerical proportion to which aristotle is a stranger.\\nintervals of sound and number are to him sacred things which have a law\\nof their own, not dependent on the variations of sense. they rise above\\nsense, and become a connecting link with the world of ideas. but it is\\nevident that plato is describing what to him appears to be also a fact.\\nthe power of a simple and characteristic melody on the impressible mind\\nof the greek is more than we can easily appreciate. the effect of\\nnational airs may bear some comparison with it. and, besides all this,\\nthere is a confusion between the harmony of musical notes and the\\nharmony of soul and body, which is so potently inspired by them.\\n\\nthe second paradox leads up to some curious and interesting\\nquestions—how far can the mind control the body? is the relation\\nbetween them one of mutual antagonism or of mutual harmony? are they\\ntwo or one, and is either of them the cause of the other? may we not at\\ntimes drop the opposition between them, and the mode of describing\\nthem, which is so familiar to us, and yet hardly conveys any precise\\nmeaning, and try to view this composite creature, man, in a more simple\\nmanner? must we not at any rate admit that there is in human nature a\\nhigher and a lower principle, divided by no distinct line, which at\\ntimes break asunder and take up arms against one another? or again,\\nthey are reconciled and move together, either unconsciously in the\\nordinary work of life, or consciously in the pursuit of some noble aim,\\nto be attained not without an effort, and for which every thought and\\nnerve are strained. and then the body becomes the good friend or ally,\\nor servant or instrument of the mind. and the mind has often a\\nwonderful and almost superhuman power of banishing disease and weakness\\nand calling out a hidden strength. reason and the desires, the\\nintellect and the senses are brought into harmony and obedience so as\\nto form a single human being. they are ever parting, ever meeting; and\\nthe identity or diversity of their tendencies or operations is for the\\nmost part unnoticed by us. when the mind touches the body through the\\nappetites, we acknowledge the responsibility of the one to the other.\\nthere is a tendency in us which says ‘drink.’ there is another which\\nsays, ‘do not drink; it is not good for you.’ and we all of us know\\nwhich is the rightful superior. we are also responsible for our health,\\nalthough into this sphere there enter some elements of necessity which\\nmay be beyond our control. still even in the management of health, care\\nand thought, continued over many years, may make us almost free agents,\\nif we do not exact too much of ourselves, and if we acknowledge that\\nall human freedom is limited by the laws of nature and of mind.\\n\\nwe are disappointed to find that plato, in the general condemnation\\nwhich he passes on the practice of medicine prevailing in his own day,\\ndepreciates the effects of diet. he would like to have diseases of a\\ndefinite character and capable of receiving a definite treatment. he is\\nafraid of invalidism interfering with the business of life. he does not\\nrecognize that time is the great healer both of mental and bodily\\ndisorders; and that remedies which are gradual and proceed little by\\nlittle are safer than those which produce a sudden catastrophe. neither\\ndoes he see that there is no way in which the mind can more surely\\ninfluence the body than by the control of eating and drinking; or any\\nother action or occasion of human life on which the higher freedom of\\nthe will can be more simple or truly asserted.\\n\\n7. lesser matters of style may be remarked.\\n\\n(1) the affected ignorance of music, which is plato’s way of expressing\\nthat he is passing lightly over the subject.\\n\\n(2) the tentative manner in which here, as in the second book, he\\nproceeds with the construction of the state.\\n\\n(3) the description of the state sometimes as a reality, and then again\\nas a work of imagination only; these are the arts by which he sustains\\nthe reader’s interest.\\n\\n(4) connecting links, or the preparation for the entire expulsion of\\nthe poets in book x.\\n\\n(5) the companion pictures of the lover of litigation and the\\nvaletudinarian, the satirical jest about the maxim of phocylides, the\\nmanner in which the image of the gold and silver citizens is taken up\\ninto the subject, and the argument from the practice of asclepius,\\nshould not escape notice.\\n\\nbook iv. adeimantus said: ‘suppose a person to argue, socrates, that\\nyou make your citizens miserable, and this by their own free-will; they\\nare the lords of the city, and yet instead of having, like other men,\\nlands and houses and money of their own, they live as mercenaries and\\nare always mounting guard.’ you may add, i replied, that they receive\\nno pay but only their food, and have no money to spend on a journey or\\na mistress. ‘well, and what answer do you give?’ my answer is, that our\\nguardians may or may not be the happiest of men,—i should not be\\nsurprised to find in the long-run that they were,—but this is not the\\naim of our constitution, which was designed for the good of the whole\\nand not of any one part. if i went to a sculptor and blamed him for\\nhaving painted the eye, which is the noblest feature of the face, not\\npurple but black, he would reply: ‘the eye must be an eye, and you\\nshould look at the statue as a whole.’ ‘now i can well imagine a fool’s\\nparadise, in which everybody is eating and drinking, clothed in purple\\nand fine linen, and potters lie on sofas and have their wheel at hand,\\nthat they may work a little when they please; and cobblers and all the\\nother classes of a state lose their distinctive character. and a state\\nmay get on without cobblers; but when the guardians degenerate into\\nboon companions, then the ruin is complete. remember that we are not\\ntalking of peasants keeping holiday, but of a state in which every man\\nis expected to do his own work. the happiness resides not in this or\\nthat class, but in the state as a whole. i have another remark to\\nmake:—a middle condition is best for artisans; they should have money\\nenough to buy tools, and not enough to be independent of business. and\\nwill not the same condition be best for our citizens? if they are poor,\\nthey will be mean; if rich, luxurious and lazy; and in neither case\\ncontented. ‘but then how will our poor city be able to go to war\\nagainst an enemy who has money?’ there may be a difficulty in fighting\\nagainst one enemy; against two there will be none. in the first place,\\nthe contest will be carried on by trained warriors against well-to-do\\ncitizens: and is not a regular athlete an easy match for two stout\\nopponents at least? suppose also, that before engaging we send\\nambassadors to one of the two cities, saying, ‘silver and gold we have\\nnot; do you help us and take our share of the spoil;’—who would fight\\nagainst the lean, wiry dogs, when they might join with them in preying\\nupon the fatted sheep? ‘but if many states join their resources, shall\\nwe not be in danger?’ i am amused to hear you use the word ‘state’ of\\nany but our own state. they are ‘states,’ but not ‘a state’—many in\\none. for in every state there are two hostile nations, rich and poor,\\nwhich you may set one against the other. but our state, while she\\nremains true to her principles, will be in very deed the mightiest of\\nhellenic states.\\n\\nto the size of the state there is no limit but the necessity of unity;\\nit must be neither too large nor too small to be one. this is a matter\\nof secondary importance, like the principle of transposition which was\\nintimated in the parable of the earthborn men. the meaning there\\nimplied was that every man should do that for which he was fitted, and\\nbe at one with himself, and then the whole city would be united. but\\nall these things are secondary, if education, which is the great\\nmatter, be duly regarded. when the wheel has once been set in motion,\\nthe speed is always increasing; and each generation improves upon the\\npreceding, both in physical and moral qualities. the care of the\\ngovernors should be directed to preserve music and gymnastic from\\ninnovation; alter the songs of a country, damon says, and you will soon\\nend by altering its laws. the change appears innocent at first, and\\nbegins in play; but the evil soon becomes serious, working secretly\\nupon the characters of individuals, then upon social and commercial\\nrelations, and lastly upon the institutions of a state; and there is\\nruin and confusion everywhere. but if education remains in the\\nestablished form, there will be no danger. a restorative process will\\nbe always going on; the spirit of law and order will raise up what has\\nfallen down. nor will any regulations be needed for the lesser matters\\nof life—rules of deportment or fashions of dress. like invites like for\\ngood or for evil. education will correct deficiencies and supply the\\npower of self-government. far be it from us to enter into the\\nparticulars of legislation; let the guardians take care of education,\\nand education will take care of all other things.\\n\\nbut without education they may patch and mend as they please; they will\\nmake no progress, any more than a patient who thinks to cure himself by\\nsome favourite remedy and will not give up his luxurious mode of\\nliving. if you tell such persons that they must first alter their\\nhabits, then they grow angry; they are charming people. ‘charming,—nay,\\nthe very reverse.’ evidently these gentlemen are not in your good\\ngraces, nor the state which is like them. and such states there are\\nwhich first ordain under penalty of death that no one shall alter the\\nconstitution, and then suffer themselves to be flattered into and out\\nof anything; and he who indulges them and fawns upon them, is their\\nleader and saviour. ‘yes, the men are as bad as the states.’ but do you\\nnot admire their cleverness? ‘nay, some of them are stupid enough to\\nbelieve what the people tell them.’ and when all the world is telling a\\nman that he is six feet high, and he has no measure, how can he believe\\nanything else? but don’t get into a passion: to see our statesmen\\ntrying their nostrums, and fancying that they can cut off at a blow the\\nhydra-like rogueries of mankind, is as good as a play. minute\\nenactments are superfluous in good states, and are useless in bad ones.\\n\\nand now what remains of the work of legislation? nothing for us; but to\\napollo the god of delphi we leave the ordering of the greatest of all\\nthings—that is to say, religion. only our ancestral deity sitting upon\\nthe centre and navel of the earth will be trusted by us if we have any\\nsense, in an affair of such magnitude. no foreign god shall be supreme\\nin our realms...\\n\\nhere, as socrates would say, let us ‘reflect on’ (greek) what has\\npreceded: thus far we have spoken not of the happiness of the citizens,\\nbut only of the well-being of the state. they may be the happiest of\\nmen, but our principal aim in founding the state was not to make them\\nhappy. they were to be guardians, not holiday-makers. in this pleasant\\nmanner is presented to us the famous question both of ancient and\\nmodern philosophy, touching the relation of duty to happiness, of right\\nto utility.\\n\\nfirst duty, then happiness, is the natural order of our moral ideas.\\nthe utilitarian principle is valuable as a corrective of error, and\\nshows to us a side of ethics which is apt to be neglected. it may be\\nadmitted further that right and utility are co-extensive, and that he\\nwho makes the happiness of mankind his object has one of the highest\\nand noblest motives of human action. but utility is not the historical\\nbasis of morality; nor the aspect in which moral and religious ideas\\ncommonly occur to the mind. the greatest happiness of all is, as we\\nbelieve, the far-off result of the divine government of the universe.\\nthe greatest happiness of the individual is certainly to be found in a\\nlife of virtue and goodness. but we seem to be more assured of a law of\\nright than we can be of a divine purpose, that ‘all mankind should be\\nsaved;’ and we infer the one from the other. and the greatest happiness\\nof the individual may be the reverse of the greatest happiness in the\\nordinary sense of the term, and may be realised in a life of pain, or\\nin a voluntary death. further, the word ‘happiness’ has several\\nambiguities; it may mean either pleasure or an ideal life, happiness\\nsubjective or objective, in this world or in another, of ourselves only\\nor of our neighbours and of all men everywhere. by the modern founder\\nof utilitarianism the self-regarding and disinterested motives of\\naction are included under the same term, although they are commonly\\nopposed by us as benevolence and self-love. the word happiness has not\\nthe definiteness or the sacredness of ‘truth’ and ‘right’; it does not\\nequally appeal to our higher nature, and has not sunk into the\\nconscience of mankind. it is associated too much with the comforts and\\nconveniences of life; too little with ‘the goods of the soul which we\\ndesire for their own sake.’ in a great trial, or danger, or temptation,\\nor in any great and heroic action, it is scarcely thought of. for these\\nreasons ‘the greatest happiness’ principle is not the true foundation\\nof ethics. but though not the first principle, it is the second, which\\nis like unto it, and is often of easier application. for the larger\\npart of human actions are neither right nor wrong, except in so far as\\nthey tend to the happiness of mankind (introd. to gorgias and\\nphilebus).\\n\\nthe same question reappears in politics, where the useful or expedient\\nseems to claim a larger sphere and to have a greater authority. for\\nconcerning political measures, we chiefly ask: how will they affect the\\nhappiness of mankind? yet here too we may observe that what we term\\nexpediency is merely the law of right limited by the conditions of\\nhuman society. right and truth are the highest aims of government as\\nwell as of individuals; and we ought not to lose sight of them because\\nwe cannot directly enforce them. they appeal to the better mind of\\nnations; and sometimes they are too much for merely temporal interests\\nto resist. they are the watchwords which all men use in matters of\\npublic policy, as well as in their private dealings; the peace of\\neurope may be said to depend upon them. in the most commercial and\\nutilitarian states of society the power of ideas remains. and all the\\nhigher class of statesmen have in them something of that idealism which\\npericles is said to have gathered from the teaching of anaxagoras. they\\nrecognise that the true leader of men must be above the motives of\\nambition, and that national character is of greater value than material\\ncomfort and prosperity. and this is the order of thought in plato;\\nfirst, he expects his citizens to do their duty, and then under\\nfavourable circumstances, that is to say, in a well-ordered state,\\ntheir happiness is assured. that he was far from excluding the modern\\nprinciple of utility in politics is sufficiently evident from other\\npassages; in which ‘the most beneficial is affirmed to be the most\\nhonourable’, and also ‘the most sacred’.\\n\\nwe may note\\n\\n(1) the manner in which the objection of adeimantus here, is designed\\nto draw out and deepen the argument of socrates.\\n\\n(2) the conception of a whole as lying at the foundation both of\\npolitics and of art, in the latter supplying the only principle of\\ncriticism, which, under the various names of harmony, symmetry,\\nmeasure, proportion, unity, the greek seems to have applied to works of\\nart.\\n\\n(3) the requirement that the state should be limited in size, after the\\ntraditional model of a greek state; as in the politics of aristotle,\\nthe fact that the cities of hellas were small is converted into a\\nprinciple.\\n\\n(4) the humorous pictures of the lean dogs and the fatted sheep, of the\\nlight active boxer upsetting two stout gentlemen at least, of the\\n‘charming’ patients who are always making themselves worse; or again,\\nthe playful assumption that there is no state but our own; or the grave\\nirony with which the statesman is excused who believes that he is six\\nfeet high because he is told so, and having nothing to measure with is\\nto be pardoned for his ignorance—he is too amusing for us to be\\nseriously angry with him.\\n\\n(5) the light and superficial manner in which religion is passed over\\nwhen provision has been made for two great principles,—first, that\\nreligion shall be based on the highest conception of the gods,\\nsecondly, that the true national or hellenic type shall be\\nmaintained...\\n\\nsocrates proceeds: but where amid all this is justice? son of ariston,\\ntell me where. light a candle and search the city, and get your brother\\nand the rest of our friends to help in seeking for her. ‘that won’t\\ndo,’ replied glaucon, ‘you yourself promised to make the search and\\ntalked about the impiety of deserting justice.’ well, i said, i will\\nlead the way, but do you follow. my notion is, that our state being\\nperfect will contain all the four virtues—wisdom, courage, temperance,\\njustice. if we eliminate the three first, the unknown remainder will be\\njustice.\\n\\nfirst then, of wisdom: the state which we have called into being will\\nbe wise because politic. and policy is one among many kinds of\\nskill,—not the skill of the carpenter, or of the worker in metal, or of\\nthe husbandman, but the skill of him who advises about the interests of\\nthe whole state. of such a kind is the skill of the guardians, who are\\na small class in number, far smaller than the blacksmiths; but in them\\nis concentrated the wisdom of the state. and if this small ruling class\\nhave wisdom, then the whole state will be wise.\\n\\nour second virtue is courage, which we have no difficulty in finding in\\nanother class—that of soldiers. courage may be defined as a sort of\\nsalvation—the never-failing salvation of the opinions which law and\\neducation have prescribed concerning dangers. you know the way in which\\ndyers first prepare the white ground and then lay on the dye of purple\\nor of any other colour. colours dyed in this way become fixed, and no\\nsoap or lye will ever wash them out. now the ground is education, and\\nthe laws are the colours; and if the ground is properly laid, neither\\nthe soap of pleasure nor the lye of pain or fear will ever wash them\\nout. this power which preserves right opinion about danger i would ask\\nyou to call ‘courage,’ adding the epithet ‘political’ or ‘civilized’ in\\norder to distinguish it from mere animal courage and from a higher\\ncourage which may hereafter be discussed.\\n\\ntwo virtues remain; temperance and justice. more than the preceding\\nvirtues temperance suggests the idea of harmony. some light is thrown\\nupon the nature of this virtue by the popular description of a man as\\n‘master of himself’—which has an absurd sound, because the master is\\nalso the servant. the expression really means that the better principle\\nin a man masters the worse. there are in cities whole classes—women,\\nslaves and the like—who correspond to the worse, and a few only to the\\nbetter; and in our state the former class are held under control by the\\nlatter. now to which of these classes does temperance belong? ‘to both\\nof them.’ and our state if any will be the abode of temperance; and we\\nwere right in describing this virtue as a harmony which is diffused\\nthrough the whole, making the dwellers in the city to be of one mind,\\nand attuning the upper and middle and lower classes like the strings of\\nan instrument, whether you suppose them to differ in wisdom, strength\\nor wealth.\\n\\nand now we are near the spot; let us draw in and surround the cover and\\nwatch with all our eyes, lest justice should slip away and escape. tell\\nme, if you see the thicket move first. ‘nay, i would have you lead.’\\nwell then, offer up a prayer and follow. the way is dark and difficult;\\nbut we must push on. i begin to see a track. ‘good news.’ why, glaucon,\\nour dulness of scent is quite ludicrous! while we are straining our\\neyes into the distance, justice is tumbling out at our feet. we are as\\nbad as people looking for a thing which they have in their hands. have\\nyou forgotten our old principle of the division of labour, or of every\\nman doing his own business, concerning which we spoke at the foundation\\nof the state—what but this was justice? is there any other virtue\\nremaining which can compete with wisdom and temperance and courage in\\nthe scale of political virtue? for ‘every one having his own’ is the\\ngreat object of government; and the great object of trade is that every\\nman should do his own business. not that there is much harm in a\\ncarpenter trying to be a cobbler, or a cobbler transforming himself\\ninto a carpenter; but great evil may arise from the cobbler leaving his\\nlast and turning into a guardian or legislator, or when a single\\nindividual is trainer, warrior, legislator, all in one. and this evil\\nis injustice, or every man doing another’s business. i do not say that\\nas yet we are in a condition to arrive at a final conclusion. for the\\ndefinition which we believe to hold good in states has still to be\\ntested by the individual. having read the large letters we will now\\ncome back to the small. from the two together a brilliant light may be\\nstruck out...\\n\\nsocrates proceeds to discover the nature of justice by a method of\\nresidues. each of the first three virtues corresponds to one of the\\nthree parts of the soul and one of the three classes in the state,\\nalthough the third, temperance, has more of the nature of a harmony\\nthan the first two. if there be a fourth virtue, that can only be\\nsought for in the relation of the three parts in the soul or classes in\\nthe state to one another. it is obvious and simple, and for that very\\nreason has not been found out. the modern logician will be inclined to\\nobject that ideas cannot be separated like chemical substances, but\\nthat they run into one another and may be only different aspects or\\nnames of the same thing, and such in this instance appears to be the\\ncase. for the definition here given of justice is verbally the same as\\none of the definitions of temperance given by socrates in the\\ncharmides, which however is only provisional, and is afterwards\\nrejected. and so far from justice remaining over when the other virtues\\nare eliminated, the justice and temperance of the republic can with\\ndifficulty be distinguished. temperance appears to be the virtue of a\\npart only, and one of three, whereas justice is a universal virtue of\\nthe whole soul. yet on the other hand temperance is also described as a\\nsort of harmony, and in this respect is akin to justice. justice seems\\nto differ from temperance in degree rather than in kind; whereas\\ntemperance is the harmony of discordant elements, justice is the\\nperfect order by which all natures and classes do their own business,\\nthe right man in the right place, the division and co-operation of all\\nthe citizens. justice, again, is a more abstract notion than the other\\nvirtues, and therefore, from plato’s point of view, the foundation of\\nthem, to which they are referred and which in idea precedes them. the\\nproposal to omit temperance is a mere trick of style intended to avoid\\nmonotony.\\n\\nthere is a famous question discussed in one of the earlier dialogues of\\nplato (protagoras; arist. nic. ethics), ‘whether the virtues are one or\\nmany?’ this receives an answer which is to the effect that there are\\nfour cardinal virtues (now for the first time brought together in\\nethical philosophy), and one supreme over the rest, which is not like\\naristotle’s conception of universal justice, virtue relative to others,\\nbut the whole of virtue relative to the parts. to this universal\\nconception of justice or order in the first education and in the moral\\nnature of man, the still more universal conception of the good in the\\nsecond education and in the sphere of speculative knowledge seems to\\nsucceed. both might be equally described by the terms ‘law,’ ‘order,’\\n‘harmony;’ but while the idea of good embraces ‘all time and all\\nexistence,’ the conception of justice is not extended beyond man.\\n\\n...socrates is now going to identify the individual and the state. but\\nfirst he must prove that there are three parts of the individual soul.\\nhis argument is as follows:—quantity makes no difference in quality.\\nthe word ‘just,’ whether applied to the individual or to the state, has\\nthe same meaning. and the term ‘justice’ implied that the same three\\nprinciples in the state and in the individual were doing their own\\nbusiness. but are they really three or one? the question is difficult,\\nand one which can hardly be solved by the methods which we are now\\nusing; but the truer and longer way would take up too much of our time.\\n‘the shorter will satisfy me.’ well then, you would admit that the\\nqualities of states mean the qualities of the individuals who compose\\nthem? the scythians and thracians are passionate, our own race\\nintellectual, and the egyptians and phoenicians covetous, because the\\nindividual members of each have such and such a character; the\\ndifficulty is to determine whether the several principles are one or\\nthree; whether, that is to say, we reason with one part of our nature,\\ndesire with another, are angry with another, or whether the whole soul\\ncomes into play in each sort of action. this enquiry, however, requires\\na very exact definition of terms. the same thing in the same relation\\ncannot be affected in two opposite ways. but there is no impossibility\\nin a man standing still, yet moving his arms, or in a top which is\\nfixed on one spot going round upon its axis. there is no necessity to\\nmention all the possible exceptions; let us provisionally assume that\\nopposites cannot do or be or suffer opposites in the same relation. and\\nto the class of opposites belong assent and dissent, desire and\\navoidance. and one form of desire is thirst and hunger: and here arises\\na new point—thirst is thirst of drink, hunger is hunger of food; not of\\nwarm drink or of a particular kind of food, with the single exception\\nof course that the very fact of our desiring anything implies that it\\nis good. when relative terms have no attributes, their correlatives\\nhave no attributes; when they have attributes, their correlatives also\\nhave them. for example, the term ‘greater’ is simply relative to\\n‘less,’ and knowledge refers to a subject of knowledge. but on the\\nother hand, a particular knowledge is of a particular subject. again,\\nevery science has a distinct character, which is defined by an object;\\nmedicine, for example, is the science of health, although not to be\\nconfounded with health. having cleared our ideas thus far, let us\\nreturn to the original instance of thirst, which has a definite\\nobject—drink. now the thirsty soul may feel two distinct impulses; the\\nanimal one saying ‘drink;’ the rational one, which says ‘do not drink.’\\nthe two impulses are contradictory; and therefore we may assume that\\nthey spring from distinct principles in the soul. but is passion a\\nthird principle, or akin to desire? there is a story of a certain\\nleontius which throws some light on this question. he was coming up\\nfrom the piraeus outside the north wall, and he passed a spot where\\nthere were dead bodies lying by the executioner. he felt a longing\\ndesire to see them and also an abhorrence of them; at first he turned\\naway and shut his eyes, then, suddenly tearing them open, he\\nsaid,—‘take your fill, ye wretches, of the fair sight.’ now is there\\nnot here a third principle which is often found to come to the\\nassistance of reason against desire, but never of desire against\\nreason? this is passion or spirit, of the separate existence of which\\nwe may further convince ourselves by putting the following case:—when a\\nman suffers justly, if he be of a generous nature he is not indignant\\nat the hardships which he undergoes: but when he suffers unjustly, his\\nindignation is his great support; hunger and thirst cannot tame him;\\nthe spirit within him must do or die, until the voice of the shepherd,\\nthat is, of reason, bidding his dog bark no more, is heard within. this\\nshows that passion is the ally of reason. is passion then the same with\\nreason? no, for the former exists in children and brutes; and homer\\naffords a proof of the distinction between them when he says, ‘he smote\\nhis breast, and thus rebuked his soul.’\\n\\nand now, at last, we have reached firm ground, and are able to infer\\nthat the virtues of the state and of the individual are the same. for\\nwisdom and courage and justice in the state are severally the wisdom\\nand courage and justice in the individuals who form the state. each of\\nthe three classes will do the work of its own class in the state, and\\neach part in the individual soul; reason, the superior, and passion,\\nthe inferior, will be harmonized by the influence of music and\\ngymnastic. the counsellor and the warrior, the head and the arm, will\\nact together in the town of mansoul, and keep the desires in proper\\nsubjection. the courage of the warrior is that quality which preserves\\na right opinion about dangers in spite of pleasures and pains. the\\nwisdom of the counsellor is that small part of the soul which has\\nauthority and reason. the virtue of temperance is the friendship of the\\nruling and the subject principles, both in the state and in the\\nindividual. of justice we have already spoken; and the notion already\\ngiven of it may be confirmed by common instances. will the just state\\nor the just individual steal, lie, commit adultery, or be guilty of\\nimpiety to gods and men? ‘no.’ and is not the reason of this that the\\nseveral principles, whether in the state or in the individual, do their\\nown business? and justice is the quality which makes just men and just\\nstates. moreover, our old division of labour, which required that there\\nshould be one man for one use, was a dream or anticipation of what was\\nto follow; and that dream has now been realized in justice, which\\nbegins by binding together the three chords of the soul, and then acts\\nharmoniously in every relation of life. and injustice, which is the\\ninsubordination and disobedience of the inferior elements in the soul,\\nis the opposite of justice, and is inharmonious and unnatural, being to\\nthe soul what disease is to the body; for in the soul as well as in the\\nbody, good or bad actions produce good or bad habits. and virtue is the\\nhealth and beauty and well-being of the soul, and vice is the disease\\nand weakness and deformity of the soul.\\n\\nagain the old question returns upon us: is justice or injustice the\\nmore profitable? the question has become ridiculous. for injustice,\\nlike mortal disease, makes life not worth having. come up with me to\\nthe hill which overhangs the city and look down upon the single form of\\nvirtue, and the infinite forms of vice, among which are four special\\nones, characteristic both of states and of individuals. and the state\\nwhich corresponds to the single form of virtue is that which we have\\nbeen describing, wherein reason rules under one of two names—monarchy\\nand aristocracy. thus there are five forms in all, both of states and\\nof souls...\\n\\nin attempting to prove that the soul has three separate faculties,\\nplato takes occasion to discuss what makes difference of faculties. and\\nthe criterion which he proposes is difference in the working of the\\nfaculties. the same faculty cannot produce contradictory effects. but\\nthe path of early reasoners is beset by thorny entanglements, and he\\nwill not proceed a step without first clearing the ground. this leads\\nhim into a tiresome digression, which is intended to explain the nature\\nof contradiction. first, the contradiction must be at the same time and\\nin the same relation. secondly, no extraneous word must be introduced\\ninto either of the terms in which the contradictory proposition is\\nexpressed: for example, thirst is of drink, not of warm drink. he\\nimplies, what he does not say, that if, by the advice of reason, or by\\nthe impulse of anger, a man is restrained from drinking, this proves\\nthat thirst, or desire under which thirst is included, is distinct from\\nanger and reason. but suppose that we allow the term ‘thirst’ or\\n‘desire’ to be modified, and say an ‘angry thirst,’ or a ‘revengeful\\ndesire,’ then the two spheres of desire and anger overlap and become\\nconfused. this case therefore has to be excluded. and still there\\nremains an exception to the rule in the use of the term ‘good,’ which\\nis always implied in the object of desire. these are the discussions of\\nan age before logic; and any one who is wearied by them should remember\\nthat they are necessary to the clearing up of ideas in the first\\ndevelopment of the human faculties.\\n\\nthe psychology of plato extends no further than the division of the\\nsoul into the rational, irascible, and concupiscent elements, which, as\\nfar as we know, was first made by him, and has been retained by\\naristotle and succeeding ethical writers. the chief difficulty in this\\nearly analysis of the mind is to define exactly the place of the\\nirascible faculty (greek), which may be variously described under the\\nterms righteous indignation, spirit, passion. it is the foundation of\\ncourage, which includes in plato moral courage, the courage of enduring\\npain, and of surmounting intellectual difficulties, as well as of\\nmeeting dangers in war. though irrational, it inclines to side with the\\nrational: it cannot be aroused by punishment when justly inflicted: it\\nsometimes takes the form of an enthusiasm which sustains a man in the\\nperformance of great actions. it is the ‘lion heart’ with which the\\nreason makes a treaty. on the other hand it is negative rather than\\npositive; it is indignant at wrong or falsehood, but does not, like\\nlove in the symposium and phaedrus, aspire to the vision of truth or\\ngood. it is the peremptory military spirit which prevails in the\\ngovernment of honour. it differs from anger (greek), this latter term\\nhaving no accessory notion of righteous indignation. although aristotle\\nhas retained the word, yet we may observe that ‘passion’ (greek) has\\nwith him lost its affinity to the rational and has become\\nindistinguishable from ‘anger’ (greek). and to this vernacular use\\nplato himself in the laws seems to revert, though not always. by modern\\nphilosophy too, as well as in our ordinary conversation, the words\\nanger or passion are employed almost exclusively in a bad sense; there\\nis no connotation of a just or reasonable cause by which they are\\naroused. the feeling of ‘righteous indignation’ is too partial and\\naccidental to admit of our regarding it as a separate virtue or habit.\\nwe are tempted also to doubt whether plato is right in supposing that\\nan offender, however justly condemned, could be expected to acknowledge\\nthe justice of his sentence; this is the spirit of a philosopher or\\nmartyr rather than of a criminal.\\n\\nwe may observe how nearly plato approaches aristotle’s famous thesis,\\nthat ‘good actions produce good habits.’ the words ‘as healthy\\npractices (greek) produce health, so do just practices produce\\njustice,’ have a sound very like the nicomachean ethics. but we note\\nalso that an incidental remark in plato has become a far-reaching\\nprinciple in aristotle, and an inseparable part of a great ethical\\nsystem.\\n\\nthere is a difficulty in understanding what plato meant by ‘the longer\\nway’: he seems to intimate some metaphysic of the future which will not\\nbe satisfied with arguing from the principle of contradiction. in the\\nsixth and seventh books (compare sophist and parmenides) he has given\\nus a sketch of such a metaphysic; but when glaucon asks for the final\\nrevelation of the idea of good, he is put off with the declaration that\\nhe has not yet studied the preliminary sciences. how he would have\\nfilled up the sketch, or argued about such questions from a higher\\npoint of view, we can only conjecture. perhaps he hoped to find some a\\npriori method of developing the parts out of the whole; or he might\\nhave asked which of the ideas contains the other ideas, and possibly\\nhave stumbled on the hegelian identity of the ‘ego’ and the\\n‘universal.’ or he may have imagined that ideas might be constructed in\\nsome manner analogous to the construction of figures and numbers in the\\nmathematical sciences. the most certain and necessary truth was to\\nplato the universal; and to this he was always seeking to refer all\\nknowledge or opinion, just as in modern times we seek to rest them on\\nthe opposite pole of induction and experience. the aspirations of\\nmetaphysicians have always tended to pass beyond the limits of human\\nthought and language: they seem to have reached a height at which they\\nare ‘moving about in worlds unrealized,’ and their conceptions,\\nalthough profoundly affecting their own minds, become invisible or\\nunintelligible to others. we are not therefore surprized to find that\\nplato himself has nowhere clearly explained his doctrine of ideas; or\\nthat his school in a later generation, like his contemporaries glaucon\\nand adeimantus, were unable to follow him in this region of\\nspeculation. in the sophist, where he is refuting the scepticism which\\nmaintained either that there was no such thing as predication, or that\\nall might be predicated of all, he arrives at the conclusion that some\\nideas combine with some, but not all with all. but he makes only one or\\ntwo steps forward on this path; he nowhere attains to any connected\\nsystem of ideas, or even to a knowledge of the most elementary\\nrelations of the sciences to one another.\\n\\nbook v. i was going to enumerate the four forms of vice or decline in\\nstates, when polemarchus—he was sitting a little farther from me than\\nadeimantus—taking him by the coat and leaning towards him, said\\nsomething in an undertone, of which i only caught the words, ‘shall we\\nlet him off?’ ‘certainly not,’ said adeimantus, raising his voice.\\nwhom, i said, are you not going to let off? ‘you,’ he said. why?\\n‘because we think that you are not dealing fairly with us in omitting\\nwomen and children, of whom you have slily disposed under the general\\nformula that friends have all things in common.’ and was i not right?\\n‘yes,’ he replied, ‘but there are many sorts of communism or community,\\nand we want to know which of them is right. the company, as you have\\njust heard, are resolved to have a further explanation.’ thrasymachus\\nsaid, ‘do you think that we have come hither to dig for gold, or to\\nhear you discourse?’ yes, i said; but the discourse should be of a\\nreasonable length. glaucon added, ‘yes, socrates, and there is reason\\nin spending the whole of life in such discussions; but pray, without\\nmore ado, tell us how this community is to be carried out, and how the\\ninterval between birth and education is to be filled up.’ well, i said,\\nthe subject has several difficulties—what is possible? is the first\\nquestion. what is desirable? is the second. ‘fear not,’ he replied,\\n‘for you are speaking among friends.’ that, i replied, is a sorry\\nconsolation; i shall destroy my friends as well as myself. not that i\\nmind a little innocent laughter; but he who kills the truth is a\\nmurderer. ‘then,’ said glaucon, laughing, ‘in case you should murder us\\nwe will acquit you beforehand, and you shall be held free from the\\nguilt of deceiving us.’\\n\\nsocrates proceeds:—the guardians of our state are to be watch-dogs, as\\nwe have already said. now dogs are not divided into hes and shes—we do\\nnot take the masculine gender out to hunt and leave the females at home\\nto look after their puppies. they have the same employments—the only\\ndifference between them is that the one sex is stronger and the other\\nweaker. but if women are to have the same employments as men, they must\\nhave the same education—they must be taught music and gymnastics, and\\nthe art of war. i know that a great joke will be made of their riding\\non horseback and carrying weapons; the sight of the naked old wrinkled\\nwomen showing their agility in the palaestra will certainly not be a\\nvision of beauty, and may be expected to become a famous jest. but we\\nmust not mind the wits; there was a time when they might have laughed\\nat our present gymnastics. all is habit: people have at last found out\\nthat the exposure is better than the concealment of the person, and now\\nthey laugh no more. evil only should be the subject of ridicule.\\n\\nthe first question is, whether women are able either wholly or\\npartially to share in the employments of men. and here we may be\\ncharged with inconsistency in making the proposal at all. for we\\nstarted originally with the division of labour; and the diversity of\\nemployments was based on the difference of natures. but is there no\\ndifference between men and women? nay, are they not wholly different?\\nthere was the difficulty, glaucon, which made me unwilling to speak of\\nfamily relations. however, when a man is out of his depth, whether in a\\npool or in an ocean, he can only swim for his life; and we must try to\\nfind a way of escape, if we can.\\n\\nthe argument is, that different natures have different uses, and the\\nnatures of men and women are said to differ. but this is only a verbal\\nopposition. we do not consider that the difference may be purely\\nnominal and accidental; for example, a bald man and a hairy man are\\nopposed in a single point of view, but you cannot infer that because a\\nbald man is a cobbler a hairy man ought not to be a cobbler. now why is\\nsuch an inference erroneous? simply because the opposition between them\\nis partial only, like the difference between a male physician and a\\nfemale physician, not running through the whole nature, like the\\ndifference between a physician and a carpenter. and if the difference\\nof the sexes is only that the one beget and the other bear children,\\nthis does not prove that they ought to have distinct educations.\\nadmitting that women differ from men in capacity, do not men equally\\ndiffer from one another? has not nature scattered all the qualities\\nwhich our citizens require indifferently up and down among the two\\nsexes? and even in their peculiar pursuits, are not women often, though\\nin some cases superior to men, ridiculously enough surpassed by them?\\nwomen are the same in kind as men, and have the same aptitude or want\\nof aptitude for medicine or gymnastic or war, but in a less degree. one\\nwoman will be a good guardian, another not; and the good must be chosen\\nto be the colleagues of our guardians. if however their natures are the\\nsame, the inference is that their education must also be the same;\\nthere is no longer anything unnatural or impossible in a woman learning\\nmusic and gymnastic. and the education which we give them will be the\\nvery best, far superior to that of cobblers, and will train up the very\\nbest women, and nothing can be more advantageous to the state than\\nthis. therefore let them strip, clothed in their chastity, and share in\\nthe toils of war and in the defence of their country; he who laughs at\\nthem is a fool for his pains.\\n\\nthe first wave is past, and the argument is compelled to admit that men\\nand women have common duties and pursuits. a second and greater wave is\\nrolling in—community of wives and children; is this either expedient or\\npossible? the expediency i do not doubt; i am not so sure of the\\npossibility. ‘nay, i think that a considerable doubt will be\\nentertained on both points.’ i meant to have escaped the trouble of\\nproving the first, but as you have detected the little stratagem i must\\neven submit. only allow me to feed my fancy like the solitary in his\\nwalks, with a dream of what might be, and then i will return to the\\nquestion of what can be.\\n\\nin the first place our rulers will enforce the laws and make new ones\\nwhere they are wanted, and their allies or ministers will obey. you, as\\nlegislator, have already selected the men; and now you shall select the\\nwomen. after the selection has been made, they will dwell in common\\nhouses and have their meals in common, and will be brought together by\\na necessity more certain than that of mathematics. but they cannot be\\nallowed to live in licentiousness; that is an unholy thing, which the\\nrulers are determined to prevent. for the avoidance of this, holy\\nmarriage festivals will be instituted, and their holiness will be in\\nproportion to their usefulness. and here, glaucon, i should like to ask\\n(as i know that you are a breeder of birds and animals), do you not\\ntake the greatest care in the mating? ‘certainly.’ and there is no\\nreason to suppose that less care is required in the marriage of human\\nbeings. but then our rulers must be skilful physicians of the state,\\nfor they will often need a strong dose of falsehood in order to bring\\nabout desirable unions between their subjects. the good must be paired\\nwith the good, and the bad with the bad, and the offspring of the one\\nmust be reared, and of the other destroyed; in this way the flock will\\nbe preserved in prime condition. hymeneal festivals will be celebrated\\nat times fixed with an eye to population, and the brides and\\nbridegrooms will meet at them; and by an ingenious system of lots the\\nrulers will contrive that the brave and the fair come together, and\\nthat those of inferior breed are paired with inferiors—the latter will\\nascribe to chance what is really the invention of the rulers. and when\\nchildren are born, the offspring of the brave and fair will be carried\\nto an enclosure in a certain part of the city, and there attended by\\nsuitable nurses; the rest will be hurried away to places unknown. the\\nmothers will be brought to the fold and will suckle the children; care\\nhowever must be taken that none of them recognise their own offspring;\\nand if necessary other nurses may also be hired. the trouble of\\nwatching and getting up at night will be transferred to attendants.\\n‘then the wives of our guardians will have a fine easy time when they\\nare having children.’ and quite right too, i said, that they should.\\n\\nthe parents ought to be in the prime of life, which for a man may be\\nreckoned at thirty years—from twenty-five, when he has ‘passed the\\npoint at which the speed of life is greatest,’ to fifty-five; and at\\ntwenty years for a woman—from twenty to forty. any one above or below\\nthose ages who partakes in the hymeneals shall be guilty of impiety;\\nalso every one who forms a marriage connexion at other times without\\nthe consent of the rulers. this latter regulation applies to those who\\nare within the specified ages, after which they may range at will,\\nprovided they avoid the prohibited degrees of parents and children, or\\nof brothers and sisters, which last, however, are not absolutely\\nprohibited, if a dispensation be procured. ‘but how shall we know the\\ndegrees of affinity, when all things are common?’ the answer is, that\\nbrothers and sisters are all such as are born seven or nine months\\nafter the espousals, and their parents those who are then espoused, and\\nevery one will have many children and every child many parents.\\n\\nsocrates proceeds: i have now to prove that this scheme is advantageous\\nand also consistent with our entire polity. the greatest good of a\\nstate is unity; the greatest evil, discord and distraction. and there\\nwill be unity where there are no private pleasures or pains or\\ninterests—where if one member suffers all the members suffer, if one\\ncitizen is touched all are quickly sensitive; and the least hurt to the\\nlittle finger of the state runs through the whole body and vibrates to\\nthe soul. for the true state, like an individual, is injured as a whole\\nwhen any part is affected. every state has subjects and rulers, who in\\na democracy are called rulers, and in other states masters: but in our\\nstate they are called saviours and allies; and the subjects who in\\nother states are termed slaves, are by us termed nurturers and\\npaymasters, and those who are termed comrades and colleagues in other\\nplaces, are by us called fathers and brothers. and whereas in other\\nstates members of the same government regard one of their colleagues as\\na friend and another as an enemy, in our state no man is a stranger to\\nanother; for every citizen is connected with every other by ties of\\nblood, and these names and this way of speaking will have a\\ncorresponding reality—brother, father, sister, mother, repeated from\\ninfancy in the ears of children, will not be mere words. then again the\\ncitizens will have all things in common, in having common property they\\nwill have common pleasures and pains.\\n\\ncan there be strife and contention among those who are of one mind; or\\nlawsuits about property when men have nothing but their bodies which\\nthey call their own; or suits about violence when every one is bound to\\ndefend himself? the permission to strike when insulted will be an\\n‘antidote’ to the knife and will prevent disturbances in the state. but\\nno younger man will strike an elder; reverence will prevent him from\\nlaying hands on his kindred, and he will fear that the rest of the\\nfamily may retaliate. moreover, our citizens will be rid of the lesser\\nevils of life; there will be no flattery of the rich, no sordid\\nhousehold cares, no borrowing and not paying. compared with the\\ncitizens of other states, ours will be olympic victors, and crowned\\nwith blessings greater still—they and their children having a better\\nmaintenance during life, and after death an honourable burial. nor has\\nthe happiness of the individual been sacrificed to the happiness of the\\nstate; our olympic victor has not been turned into a cobbler, but he\\nhas a happiness beyond that of any cobbler. at the same time, if any\\nconceited youth begins to dream of appropriating the state to himself,\\nhe must be reminded that ‘half is better than the whole.’ ‘i should\\ncertainly advise him to stay where he is when he has the promise of\\nsuch a brave life.’\\n\\nbut is such a community possible?—as among the animals, so also among\\nmen; and if possible, in what way possible? about war there is no\\ndifficulty; the principle of communism is adapted to military service.\\nparents will take their children to look on at a battle, just as\\npotters’ boys are trained to the business by looking on at the wheel.\\nand to the parents themselves, as to other animals, the sight of their\\nyoung ones will prove a great incentive to bravery. young warriors must\\nlearn, but they must not run into danger, although a certain degree of\\nrisk is worth incurring when the benefit is great. the young creatures\\nshould be placed under the care of experienced veterans, and they\\nshould have wings—that is to say, swift and tractable steeds on which\\nthey may fly away and escape. one of the first things to be done is to\\nteach a youth to ride.\\n\\ncowards and deserters shall be degraded to the class of husbandmen;\\ngentlemen who allow themselves to be taken prisoners, may be presented\\nto the enemy. but what shall be done to the hero? first of all he shall\\nbe crowned by all the youths in the army; secondly, he shall receive\\nthe right hand of fellowship; and thirdly, do you think that there is\\nany harm in his being kissed? we have already determined that he shall\\nhave more wives than others, in order that he may have as many children\\nas possible. and at a feast he shall have more to eat; we have the\\nauthority of homer for honouring brave men with ‘long chines,’ which is\\nan appropriate compliment, because meat is a very strengthening thing.\\nfill the bowl then, and give the best seats and meats to the brave—may\\nthey do them good! and he who dies in battle will be at once declared\\nto be of the golden race, and will, as we believe, become one of\\nhesiod’s guardian angels. he shall be worshipped after death in the\\nmanner prescribed by the oracle; and not only he, but all other\\nbenefactors of the state who die in any other way, shall be admitted to\\nthe same honours.\\n\\nthe next question is, how shall we treat our enemies? shall hellenes be\\nenslaved? no; for there is too great a risk of the whole race passing\\nunder the yoke of the barbarians. or shall the dead be despoiled?\\ncertainly not; for that sort of thing is an excuse for skulking, and\\nhas been the ruin of many an army. there is meanness and feminine\\nmalice in making an enemy of the dead body, when the soul which was the\\nowner has fled—like a dog who cannot reach his assailants, and quarrels\\nwith the stones which are thrown at him instead. again, the arms of\\nhellenes should not be offered up in the temples of the gods; they are\\na pollution, for they are taken from brethren. and on similar grounds\\nthere should be a limit to the devastation of hellenic territory—the\\nhouses should not be burnt, nor more than the annual produce carried\\noff. for war is of two kinds, civil and foreign; the first of which is\\nproperly termed ‘discord,’ and only the second ‘war;’ and war between\\nhellenes is in reality civil war—a quarrel in a family, which is ever\\nto be regarded as unpatriotic and unnatural, and ought to be prosecuted\\nwith a view to reconciliation in a true phil-hellenic spirit, as of\\nthose who would chasten but not utterly enslave. the war is not against\\na whole nation who are a friendly multitude of men, women, and\\nchildren, but only against a few guilty persons; when they are punished\\npeace will be restored. that is the way in which hellenes should war\\nagainst one another—and against barbarians, as they war against one\\nanother now.\\n\\n‘but, my dear socrates, you are forgetting the main question: is such a\\nstate possible? i grant all and more than you say about the blessedness\\nof being one family—fathers, brothers, mothers, daughters, going out to\\nwar together; but i want to ascertain the possibility of this ideal\\nstate.’ you are too unmerciful. the first wave and the second wave i\\nhave hardly escaped, and now you will certainly drown me with the\\nthird. when you see the towering crest of the wave, i expect you to\\ntake pity. ‘not a whit.’\\n\\nwell, then, we were led to form our ideal polity in the search after\\njustice, and the just man answered to the just state. is this ideal at\\nall the worse for being impracticable? would the picture of a perfectly\\nbeautiful man be any the worse because no such man ever lived? can any\\nreality come up to the idea? nature will not allow words to be fully\\nrealized; but if i am to try and realize the ideal of the state in a\\nmeasure, i think that an approach may be made to the perfection of\\nwhich i dream by one or two, i do not say slight, but possible changes\\nin the present constitution of states. i would reduce them to a single\\none—the great wave, as i call it. until, then, kings are philosophers,\\nor philosophers are kings, cities will never cease from ill: no, nor\\nthe human race; nor will our ideal polity ever come into being. i know\\nthat this is a hard saying, which few will be able to receive.\\n‘socrates, all the world will take off his coat and rush upon you with\\nsticks and stones, and therefore i would advise you to prepare an\\nanswer.’ you got me into the scrape, i said. ‘and i was right,’ he\\nreplied; ‘however, i will stand by you as a sort of do-nothing,\\nwell-meaning ally.’ having the help of such a champion, i will do my\\nbest to maintain my position. and first, i must explain of whom i speak\\nand what sort of natures these are who are to be philosophers and\\nrulers. as you are a man of pleasure, you will not have forgotten how\\nindiscriminate lovers are in their attachments; they love all, and turn\\nblemishes into beauties. the snub-nosed youth is said to have a winning\\ngrace; the beak of another has a royal look; the featureless are\\nfaultless; the dark are manly, the fair angels; the sickly have a new\\nterm of endearment invented expressly for them, which is ‘honey-pale.’\\nlovers of wine and lovers of ambition also desire the objects of their\\naffection in every form. now here comes the point:—the philosopher too\\nis a lover of knowledge in every form; he has an insatiable curiosity.\\n‘but will curiosity make a philosopher? are the lovers of sights and\\nsounds, who let out their ears to every chorus at the dionysiac\\nfestivals, to be called philosophers?’ they are not true philosophers,\\nbut only an imitation. ‘then how are we to describe the true?’\\n\\nyou would acknowledge the existence of abstract ideas, such as justice,\\nbeauty, good, evil, which are severally one, yet in their various\\ncombinations appear to be many. those who recognize these realities are\\nphilosophers; whereas the other class hear sounds and see colours, and\\nunderstand their use in the arts, but cannot attain to the true or\\nwaking vision of absolute justice or beauty or truth; they have not the\\nlight of knowledge, but of opinion, and what they see is a dream only.\\nperhaps he of whom we say the last will be angry with us; can we pacify\\nhim without revealing the disorder of his mind? suppose we say that, if\\nhe has knowledge we rejoice to hear it, but knowledge must be of\\nsomething which is, as ignorance is of something which is not; and\\nthere is a third thing, which both is and is not, and is matter of\\nopinion only. opinion and knowledge, then, having distinct objects,\\nmust also be distinct faculties. and by faculties i mean powers unseen\\nand distinguishable only by the difference in their objects, as opinion\\nand knowledge differ, since the one is liable to err, but the other is\\nunerring and is the mightiest of all our faculties. if being is the\\nobject of knowledge, and not-being of ignorance, and these are the\\nextremes, opinion must lie between them, and may be called darker than\\nthe one and brighter than the other. this intermediate or contingent\\nmatter is and is not at the same time, and partakes both of existence\\nand of non-existence. now i would ask my good friend, who denies\\nabstract beauty and justice, and affirms a many beautiful and a many\\njust, whether everything he sees is not in some point of view\\ndifferent—the beautiful ugly, the pious impious, the just unjust? is\\nnot the double also the half, and are not heavy and light relative\\nterms which pass into one another? everything is and is not, as in the\\nold riddle—‘a man and not a man shot and did not shoot a bird and not a\\nbird with a stone and not a stone.’ the mind cannot be fixed on either\\nalternative; and these ambiguous, intermediate, erring, half-lighted\\nobjects, which have a disorderly movement in the region between being\\nand not-being, are the proper matter of opinion, as the immutable\\nobjects are the proper matter of knowledge. and he who grovels in the\\nworld of sense, and has only this uncertain perception of things, is\\nnot a philosopher, but a lover of opinion only...\\n\\nthe fifth book is the new beginning of the republic, in which the\\ncommunity of property and of family are first maintained, and the\\ntransition is made to the kingdom of philosophers. for both of these\\nplato, after his manner, has been preparing in some chance words of\\nbook iv, which fall unperceived on the reader’s mind, as they are\\nsupposed at first to have fallen on the ear of glaucon and adeimantus.\\nthe ‘paradoxes,’ as morgenstern terms them, of this book of the\\nrepublic will be reserved for another place; a few remarks on the\\nstyle, and some explanations of difficulties, may be briefly added.\\n\\nfirst, there is the image of the waves, which serves for a sort of\\nscheme or plan of the book. the first wave, the second wave, the third\\nand greatest wave come rolling in, and we hear the roar of them. all\\nthat can be said of the extravagance of plato’s proposals is\\nanticipated by himself. nothing is more admirable than the hesitation\\nwith which he proposes the solemn text, ‘until kings are philosophers,’\\netc.; or the reaction from the sublime to the ridiculous, when glaucon\\ndescribes the manner in which the new truth will be received by\\nmankind.\\n\\nsome defects and difficulties may be noted in the execution of the\\ncommunistic plan. nothing is told us of the application of communism to\\nthe lower classes; nor is the table of prohibited degrees capable of\\nbeing made out. it is quite possible that a child born at one hymeneal\\nfestival may marry one of its own brothers or sisters, or even one of\\nits parents, at another. plato is afraid of incestuous unions, but at\\nthe same time he does not wish to bring before us the fact that the\\ncity would be divided into families of those born seven and nine months\\nafter each hymeneal festival. if it were worth while to argue seriously\\nabout such fancies, we might remark that while all the old affinities\\nare abolished, the newly prohibited affinity rests not on any natural\\nor rational principle, but only upon the accident of children having\\nbeen born in the same month and year. nor does he explain how the lots\\ncould be so manipulated by the legislature as to bring together the\\nfairest and best. the singular expression which is employed to describe\\nthe age of five-and-twenty may perhaps be taken from some poet.\\n\\nin the delineation of the philosopher, the illustrations of the nature\\nof philosophy derived from love are more suited to the apprehension of\\nglaucon, the athenian man of pleasure, than to modern tastes or\\nfeelings. they are partly facetious, but also contain a germ of truth.\\nthat science is a whole, remains a true principle of inductive as well\\nas of metaphysical philosophy; and the love of universal knowledge is\\nstill the characteristic of the philosopher in modern as well as in\\nancient times.\\n\\nat the end of the fifth book plato introduces the figment of contingent\\nmatter, which has exercised so great an influence both on the ethics\\nand theology of the modern world, and which occurs here for the first\\ntime in the history of philosophy. he did not remark that the degrees\\nof knowledge in the subject have nothing corresponding to them in the\\nobject. with him a word must answer to an idea; and he could not\\nconceive of an opinion which was an opinion about nothing. the\\ninfluence of analogy led him to invent ‘parallels and conjugates’ and\\nto overlook facts. to us some of his difficulties are puzzling only\\nfrom their simplicity: we do not perceive that the answer to them ‘is\\ntumbling out at our feet.’ to the mind of early thinkers, the\\nconception of not-being was dark and mysterious; they did not see that\\nthis terrible apparition which threatened destruction to all knowledge\\nwas only a logical determination. the common term under which, through\\nthe accidental use of language, two entirely different ideas were\\nincluded was another source of confusion. thus through the ambiguity of\\n(greek) plato, attempting to introduce order into the first chaos of\\nhuman thought, seems to have confused perception and opinion, and to\\nhave failed to distinguish the contingent from the relative. in the\\ntheaetetus the first of these difficulties begins to clear up; in the\\nsophist the second; and for this, as well as for other reasons, both\\nthese dialogues are probably to be regarded as later than the republic.\\n\\nbook vi. having determined that the many have no knowledge of true\\nbeing, and have no clear patterns in their minds of justice, beauty,\\ntruth, and that philosophers have such patterns, we have now to ask\\nwhether they or the many shall be rulers in our state. but who can\\ndoubt that philosophers should be chosen, if they have the other\\nqualities which are required in a ruler? for they are lovers of the\\nknowledge of the eternal and of all truth; they are haters of\\nfalsehood; their meaner desires are absorbed in the interests of\\nknowledge; they are spectators of all time and all existence; and in\\nthe magnificence of their contemplation the life of man is as nothing\\nto them, nor is death fearful. also they are of a social, gracious\\ndisposition, equally free from cowardice and arrogance. they learn and\\nremember easily; they have harmonious, well-regulated minds; truth\\nflows to them sweetly by nature. can the god of jealousy himself find\\nany fault with such an assemblage of good qualities?\\n\\nhere adeimantus interposes:—‘no man can answer you, socrates; but every\\nman feels that this is owing to his own deficiency in argument. he is\\ndriven from one position to another, until he has nothing more to say,\\njust as an unskilful player at draughts is reduced to his last move by\\na more skilled opponent. and yet all the time he may be right. he may\\nknow, in this very instance, that those who make philosophy the\\nbusiness of their lives, generally turn out rogues if they are bad men,\\nand fools if they are good. what do you say?’ i should say that he is\\nquite right. ‘then how is such an admission reconcileable with the\\ndoctrine that philosophers should be kings?’\\n\\ni shall answer you in a parable which will also let you see how poor a\\nhand i am at the invention of allegories. the relation of good men to\\ntheir governments is so peculiar, that in order to defend them i must\\ntake an illustration from the world of fiction. conceive the captain of\\na ship, taller by a head and shoulders than any of the crew, yet a\\nlittle deaf, a little blind, and rather ignorant of the seaman’s art.\\nthe sailors want to steer, although they know nothing of the art; and\\nthey have a theory that it cannot be learned. if the helm is refused\\nthem, they drug the captain’s posset, bind him hand and foot, and take\\npossession of the ship. he who joins in the mutiny is termed a good\\npilot and what not; they have no conception that the true pilot must\\nobserve the winds and the stars, and must be their master, whether they\\nlike it or not;—such an one would be called by them fool, prater,\\nstar-gazer. this is my parable; which i will beg you to interpret for\\nme to those gentlemen who ask why the philosopher has such an evil\\nname, and to explain to them that not he, but those who will not use\\nhim, are to blame for his uselessness. the philosopher should not beg\\nof mankind to be put in authority over them. the wise man should not\\nseek the rich, as the proverb bids, but every man, whether rich or\\npoor, must knock at the door of the physician when he has need of him.\\nnow the pilot is the philosopher—he whom in the parable they call\\nstar-gazer, and the mutinous sailors are the mob of politicians by whom\\nhe is rendered useless. not that these are the worst enemies of\\nphilosophy, who is far more dishonoured by her own professing sons when\\nthey are corrupted by the world. need i recall the original image of\\nthe philosopher? did we not say of him just now, that he loved truth\\nand hated falsehood, and that he could not rest in the multiplicity of\\nphenomena, but was led by a sympathy in his own nature to the\\ncontemplation of the absolute? all the virtues as well as truth, who is\\nthe leader of them, took up their abode in his soul. but as you were\\nobserving, if we turn aside to view the reality, we see that the\\npersons who were thus described, with the exception of a small and\\nuseless class, are utter rogues.\\n\\nthe point which has to be considered, is the origin of this corruption\\nin nature. every one will admit that the philosopher, in our\\ndescription of him, is a rare being. but what numberless causes tend to\\ndestroy these rare beings! there is no good thing which may not be a\\ncause of evil—health, wealth, strength, rank, and the virtues\\nthemselves, when placed under unfavourable circumstances. for as in the\\nanimal or vegetable world the strongest seeds most need the\\naccompaniment of good air and soil, so the best of human characters\\nturn out the worst when they fall upon an unsuitable soil; whereas weak\\nnatures hardly ever do any considerable good or harm; they are not the\\nstuff out of which either great criminals or great heroes are made. the\\nphilosopher follows the same analogy: he is either the best or the\\nworst of all men. some persons say that the sophists are the corrupters\\nof youth; but is not public opinion the real sophist who is everywhere\\npresent—in those very persons, in the assembly, in the courts, in the\\ncamp, in the applauses and hisses of the theatre re-echoed by the\\nsurrounding hills? will not a young man’s heart leap amid these\\ndiscordant sounds? and will any education save him from being carried\\naway by the torrent? nor is this all. for if he will not yield to\\nopinion, there follows the gentle compulsion of exile or death. what\\nprinciple of rival sophists or anybody else can overcome in such an\\nunequal contest? characters there may be more than human, who are\\nexceptions—god may save a man, but not his own strength. further, i\\nwould have you consider that the hireling sophist only gives back to\\nthe world their own opinions; he is the keeper of the monster, who\\nknows how to flatter or anger him, and observes the meaning of his\\ninarticulate grunts. good is what pleases him, evil what he dislikes;\\ntruth and beauty are determined only by the taste of the brute. such is\\nthe sophist’s wisdom, and such is the condition of those who make\\npublic opinion the test of truth, whether in art or in morals. the\\ncurse is laid upon them of being and doing what it approves, and when\\nthey attempt first principles the failure is ludicrous. think of all\\nthis and ask yourself whether the world is more likely to be a believer\\nin the unity of the idea, or in the multiplicity of phenomena. and the\\nworld if not a believer in the idea cannot be a philosopher, and must\\ntherefore be a persecutor of philosophers. there is another evil:—the\\nworld does not like to lose the gifted nature, and so they flatter the\\nyoung (alcibiades) into a magnificent opinion of his own capacity; the\\ntall, proper youth begins to expand, and is dreaming of kingdoms and\\nempires. if at this instant a friend whispers to him, ‘now the gods\\nlighten thee; thou art a great fool’ and must be educated—do you think\\nthat he will listen? or suppose a better sort of man who is attracted\\ntowards philosophy, will they not make herculean efforts to spoil and\\ncorrupt him? are we not right in saying that the love of knowledge, no\\nless than riches, may divert him? men of this class (critias) often\\nbecome politicians—they are the authors of great mischief in states,\\nand sometimes also of great good. and thus philosophy is deserted by\\nher natural protectors, and others enter in and dishonour her. vulgar\\nlittle minds see the land open and rush from the prisons of the arts\\ninto her temple. a clever mechanic having a soul coarse as his body,\\nthinks that he will gain caste by becoming her suitor. for philosophy,\\neven in her fallen estate, has a dignity of her own—and he, like a bald\\nlittle blacksmith’s apprentice as he is, having made some money and got\\nout of durance, washes and dresses himself as a bridegroom and marries\\nhis master’s daughter. what will be the issue of such marriages? will\\nthey not be vile and bastard, devoid of truth and nature? ‘they will.’\\nsmall, then, is the remnant of genuine philosophers; there may be a few\\nwho are citizens of small states, in which politics are not worth\\nthinking of, or who have been detained by theages’ bridle of ill\\nhealth; for my own case of the oracular sign is almost unique, and too\\nrare to be worth mentioning. and these few when they have tasted the\\npleasures of philosophy, and have taken a look at that den of thieves\\nand place of wild beasts, which is human life, will stand aside from\\nthe storm under the shelter of a wall, and try to preserve their own\\ninnocence and to depart in peace. ‘a great work, too, will have been\\naccomplished by them.’ great, yes, but not the greatest; for man is a\\nsocial being, and can only attain his highest development in the\\nsociety which is best suited to him.\\n\\nenough, then, of the causes why philosophy has such an evil name.\\nanother question is, which of existing states is suited to her? not one\\nof them; at present she is like some exotic seed which degenerates in a\\nstrange soil; only in her proper state will she be shown to be of\\nheavenly growth. ‘and is her proper state ours or some other?’ ours in\\nall points but one, which was left undetermined. you may remember our\\nsaying that some living mind or witness of the legislator was needed in\\nstates. but we were afraid to enter upon a subject of such difficulty,\\nand now the question recurs and has not grown easier:—how may\\nphilosophy be safely studied? let us bring her into the light of day,\\nand make an end of the inquiry.\\n\\nin the first place, i say boldly that nothing can be worse than the\\npresent mode of study. persons usually pick up a little philosophy in\\nearly youth, and in the intervals of business, but they never master\\nthe real difficulty, which is dialectic. later, perhaps, they\\noccasionally go to a lecture on philosophy. years advance, and the sun\\nof philosophy, unlike that of heracleitus, sets never to rise again.\\nthis order of education should be reversed; it should begin with\\ngymnastics in youth, and as the man strengthens, he should increase the\\ngymnastics of his soul. then, when active life is over, let him finally\\nreturn to philosophy. ‘you are in earnest, socrates, but the world will\\nbe equally earnest in withstanding you—no more than thrasymachus.’ do\\nnot make a quarrel between thrasymachus and me, who were never enemies\\nand are now good friends enough. and i shall do my best to convince him\\nand all mankind of the truth of my words, or at any rate to prepare for\\nthe future when, in another life, we may again take part in similar\\ndiscussions. ‘that will be a long time hence.’ not long in comparison\\nwith eternity. the many will probably remain incredulous, for they have\\nnever seen the natural unity of ideas, but only artificial\\njuxtapositions; not free and generous thoughts, but tricks of\\ncontroversy and quips of law;—a perfect man ruling in a perfect state,\\neven a single one they have not known. and we foresaw that there was no\\nchance of perfection either in states or individuals until a necessity\\nwas laid upon philosophers—not the rogues, but those whom we called the\\nuseless class—of holding office; or until the sons of kings were\\ninspired with a true love of philosophy. whether in the infinity of\\npast time there has been, or is in some distant land, or ever will be\\nhereafter, an ideal such as we have described, we stoutly maintain that\\nthere has been, is, and will be such a state whenever the muse of\\nphilosophy rules. will you say that the world is of another mind? o, my\\nfriend, do not revile the world! they will soon change their opinion if\\nthey are gently entreated, and are taught the true nature of the\\nphilosopher. who can hate a man who loves him? or be jealous of one who\\nhas no jealousy? consider, again, that the many hate not the true but\\nthe false philosophers—the pretenders who force their way in without\\ninvitation, and are always speaking of persons and not of principles,\\nwhich is unlike the spirit of philosophy. for the true philosopher\\ndespises earthly strife; his eye is fixed on the eternal order in\\naccordance with which he moulds himself into the divine image (and not\\nhimself only, but other men), and is the creator of the virtues private\\nas well as public. when mankind see that the happiness of states is\\nonly to be found in that image, will they be angry with us for\\nattempting to delineate it? ‘certainly not. but what will be the\\nprocess of delineation?’ the artist will do nothing until he has made a\\ntabula rasa; on this he will inscribe the constitution of a state,\\nglancing often at the divine truth of nature, and from that deriving\\nthe godlike among men, mingling the two elements, rubbing out and\\npainting in, until there is a perfect harmony or fusion of the divine\\nand human. but perhaps the world will doubt the existence of such an\\nartist. what will they doubt? that the philosopher is a lover of truth,\\nhaving a nature akin to the best?—and if they admit this will they\\nstill quarrel with us for making philosophers our kings? ‘they will be\\nless disposed to quarrel.’ let us assume then that they are pacified.\\nstill, a person may hesitate about the probability of the son of a king\\nbeing a philosopher. and we do not deny that they are very liable to be\\ncorrupted; but yet surely in the course of ages there might be one\\nexception—and one is enough. if one son of a king were a philosopher,\\nand had obedient citizens, he might bring the ideal polity into being.\\nhence we conclude that our laws are not only the best, but that they\\nare also possible, though not free from difficulty.\\n\\ni gained nothing by evading the troublesome questions which arose\\nconcerning women and children. i will be wiser now and acknowledge that\\nwe must go to the bottom of another question: what is to be the\\neducation of our guardians? it was agreed that they were to be lovers\\nof their country, and were to be tested in the refiner’s fire of\\npleasures and pains, and those who came forth pure and remained fixed\\nin their principles were to have honours and rewards in life and after\\ndeath. but at this point, the argument put on her veil and turned into\\nanother path. i hesitated to make the assertion which i now\\nhazard,—that our guardians must be philosophers. you remember all the\\ncontradictory elements, which met in the philosopher—how difficult to\\nfind them all in a single person! intelligence and spirit are not often\\ncombined with steadiness; the stolid, fearless, nature is averse to\\nintellectual toil. and yet these opposite elements are all necessary,\\nand therefore, as we were saying before, the aspirant must be tested in\\npleasures and dangers; and also, as we must now further add, in the\\nhighest branches of knowledge. you will remember, that when we spoke of\\nthe virtues mention was made of a longer road, which you were satisfied\\nto leave unexplored. ‘enough seemed to have been said.’ enough, my\\nfriend; but what is enough while anything remains wanting? of all men\\nthe guardian must not faint in the search after truth; he must be\\nprepared to take the longer road, or he will never reach that higher\\nregion which is above the four virtues; and of the virtues too he must\\nnot only get an outline, but a clear and distinct vision. (strange that\\nwe should be so precise about trifles, so careless about the highest\\ntruths!) ‘and what are the highest?’ you to pretend unconsciousness,\\nwhen you have so often heard me speak of the idea of good, about which\\nwe know so little, and without which though a man gain the world he has\\nno profit of it! some people imagine that the good is wisdom; but this\\ninvolves a circle,—the good, they say, is wisdom, wisdom has to do with\\nthe good. according to others the good is pleasure; but then comes the\\nabsurdity that good is bad, for there are bad pleasures as well as\\ngood. again, the good must have reality; a man may desire the\\nappearance of virtue, but he will not desire the appearance of good.\\nought our guardians then to be ignorant of this supreme principle, of\\nwhich every man has a presentiment, and without which no man has any\\nreal knowledge of anything? ‘but, socrates, what is this supreme\\nprinciple, knowledge or pleasure, or what? you may think me\\ntroublesome, but i say that you have no business to be always repeating\\nthe doctrines of others instead of giving us your own.’ can i say what\\ni do not know? ‘you may offer an opinion.’ and will the blindness and\\ncrookedness of opinion content you when you might have the light and\\ncertainty of science? ‘i will only ask you to give such an explanation\\nof the good as you have given already of temperance and justice.’ i\\nwish that i could, but in my present mood i cannot reach to the height\\nof the knowledge of the good. to the parent or principal i cannot\\nintroduce you, but to the child begotten in his image, which i may\\ncompare with the interest on the principal, i will. (audit the account,\\nand do not let me give you a false statement of the debt.) you remember\\nour old distinction of the many beautiful and the one beautiful, the\\nparticular and the universal, the objects of sight and the objects of\\nthought? did you ever consider that the objects of sight imply a\\nfaculty of sight which is the most complex and costly of our senses,\\nrequiring not only objects of sense, but also a medium, which is light;\\nwithout which the sight will not distinguish between colours and all\\nwill be a blank? for light is the noble bond between the perceiving\\nfaculty and the thing perceived, and the god who gives us light is the\\nsun, who is the eye of the day, but is not to be confounded with the\\neye of man. this eye of the day or sun is what i call the child of the\\ngood, standing in the same relation to the visible world as the good to\\nthe intellectual. when the sun shines the eye sees, and in the\\nintellectual world where truth is, there is sight and light. now that\\nwhich is the sun of intelligent natures, is the idea of good, the cause\\nof knowledge and truth, yet other and fairer than they are, and\\nstanding in the same relation to them in which the sun stands to light.\\no inconceivable height of beauty, which is above knowledge and above\\ntruth! (‘you cannot surely mean pleasure,’ he said. peace, i replied.)\\nand this idea of good, like the sun, is also the cause of growth, and\\nthe author not of knowledge only, but of being, yet greater far than\\neither in dignity and power. ‘that is a reach of thought more than\\nhuman; but, pray, go on with the image, for i suspect that there is\\nmore behind.’ there is, i said; and bearing in mind our two suns or\\nprinciples, imagine further their corresponding worlds—one of the\\nvisible, the other of the intelligible; you may assist your fancy by\\nfiguring the distinction under the image of a line divided into two\\nunequal parts, and may again subdivide each part into two lesser\\nsegments representative of the stages of knowledge in either sphere.\\nthe lower portion of the lower or visible sphere will consist of\\nshadows and reflections, and its upper and smaller portion will contain\\nreal objects in the world of nature or of art. the sphere of the\\nintelligible will also have two divisions,—one of mathematics, in which\\nthere is no ascent but all is descent; no inquiring into premises, but\\nonly drawing of inferences. in this division the mind works with\\nfigures and numbers, the images of which are taken not from the\\nshadows, but from the objects, although the truth of them is seen only\\nwith the mind’s eye; and they are used as hypotheses without being\\nanalysed. whereas in the other division reason uses the hypotheses as\\nstages or steps in the ascent to the idea of good, to which she fastens\\nthem, and then again descends, walking firmly in the region of ideas,\\nand of ideas only, in her ascent as well as descent, and finally\\nresting in them. ‘i partly understand,’ he replied; ‘you mean that the\\nideas of science are superior to the hypothetical, metaphorical\\nconceptions of geometry and the other arts or sciences, whichever is to\\nbe the name of them; and the latter conceptions you refuse to make\\nsubjects of pure intellect, because they have no first principle,\\nalthough when resting on a first principle, they pass into the higher\\nsphere.’ you understand me very well, i said. and now to those four\\ndivisions of knowledge you may assign four corresponding faculties—pure\\nintelligence to the highest sphere; active intelligence to the second;\\nto the third, faith; to the fourth, the perception of shadows—and the\\nclearness of the several faculties will be in the same ratio as the\\ntruth of the objects to which they are related...\\n\\nlike socrates, we may recapitulate the virtues of the philosopher. in\\nlanguage which seems to reach beyond the horizon of that age and\\ncountry, he is described as ‘the spectator of all time and all\\nexistence.’ he has the noblest gifts of nature, and makes the highest\\nuse of them. all his desires are absorbed in the love of wisdom, which\\nis the love of truth. none of the graces of a beautiful soul are\\nwanting in him; neither can he fear death, or think much of human life.\\nthe ideal of modern times hardly retains the simplicity of the antique;\\nthere is not the same originality either in truth or error which\\ncharacterized the greeks. the philosopher is no longer living in the\\nunseen, nor is he sent by an oracle to convince mankind of ignorance;\\nnor does he regard knowledge as a system of ideas leading upwards by\\nregular stages to the idea of good. the eagerness of the pursuit has\\nabated; there is more division of labour and less of comprehensive\\nreflection upon nature and human life as a whole; more of exact\\nobservation and less of anticipation and inspiration. still, in the\\naltered conditions of knowledge, the parallel is not wholly lost; and\\nthere may be a use in translating the conception of plato into the\\nlanguage of our own age. the philosopher in modern times is one who\\nfixes his mind on the laws of nature in their sequence and connexion,\\nnot on fragments or pictures of nature; on history, not on controversy;\\non the truths which are acknowledged by the few, not on the opinions of\\nthe many. he is aware of the importance of ‘classifying according to\\nnature,’ and will try to ‘separate the limbs of science without\\nbreaking them’ (phaedr.). there is no part of truth, whether great or\\nsmall, which he will dishonour; and in the least things he will discern\\nthe greatest (parmen.). like the ancient philosopher he sees the world\\npervaded by analogies, but he can also tell ‘why in some cases a single\\ninstance is sufficient for an induction’ (mill’s logic), while in other\\ncases a thousand examples would prove nothing. he inquires into a\\nportion of knowledge only, because the whole has grown too vast to be\\nembraced by a single mind or life. he has a clearer conception of the\\ndivisions of science and of their relation to the mind of man than was\\npossible to the ancients. like plato, he has a vision of the unity of\\nknowledge, not as the beginning of philosophy to be attained by a study\\nof elementary mathematics, but as the far-off result of the working of\\nmany minds in many ages. he is aware that mathematical studies are\\npreliminary to almost every other; at the same time, he will not reduce\\nall varieties of knowledge to the type of mathematics. he too must have\\na nobility of character, without which genius loses the better half of\\ngreatness. regarding the world as a point in immensity, and each\\nindividual as a link in a never-ending chain of existence, he will not\\nthink much of his own life, or be greatly afraid of death.\\n\\nadeimantus objects first of all to the form of the socratic reasoning,\\nthus showing that plato is aware of the imperfection of his own method.\\nhe brings the accusation against himself which might be brought against\\nhim by a modern logician—that he extracts the answer because he knows\\nhow to put the question. in a long argument words are apt to change\\ntheir meaning slightly, or premises may be assumed or conclusions\\ninferred with rather too much certainty or universality; the variation\\nat each step may be unobserved, and yet at last the divergence becomes\\nconsiderable. hence the failure of attempts to apply arithmetical or\\nalgebraic formulae to logic. the imperfection, or rather the higher and\\nmore elastic nature of language, does not allow words to have the\\nprecision of numbers or of symbols. and this quality in language\\nimpairs the force of an argument which has many steps.\\n\\nthe objection, though fairly met by socrates in this particular\\ninstance, may be regarded as implying a reflection upon the socratic\\nmode of reasoning. and here, as elsewhere, plato seems to intimate that\\nthe time had come when the negative and interrogative method of\\nsocrates must be superseded by a positive and constructive one, of\\nwhich examples are given in some of the later dialogues. adeimantus\\nfurther argues that the ideal is wholly at variance with facts; for\\nexperience proves philosophers to be either useless or rogues. contrary\\nto all expectation socrates has no hesitation in admitting the truth of\\nthis, and explains the anomaly in an allegory, first characteristically\\ndepreciating his own inventive powers. in this allegory the people are\\ndistinguished from the professional politicians, and, as elsewhere, are\\nspoken of in a tone of pity rather than of censure under the image of\\n‘the noble captain who is not very quick in his perceptions.’\\n\\nthe uselessness of philosophers is explained by the circumstance that\\nmankind will not use them. the world in all ages has been divided\\nbetween contempt and fear of those who employ the power of ideas and\\nknow no other weapons. concerning the false philosopher, socrates\\nargues that the best is most liable to corruption; and that the finer\\nnature is more likely to suffer from alien conditions. we too observe\\nthat there are some kinds of excellence which spring from a peculiar\\ndelicacy of constitution; as is evidently true of the poetical and\\nimaginative temperament, which often seems to depend on impressions,\\nand hence can only breathe or live in a certain atmosphere. the man of\\ngenius has greater pains and greater pleasures, greater powers and\\ngreater weaknesses, and often a greater play of character than is to be\\nfound in ordinary men. he can assume the disguise of virtue or\\ndisinterestedness without having them, or veil personal enmity in the\\nlanguage of patriotism and philosophy,—he can say the word which all\\nmen are thinking, he has an insight which is terrible into the follies\\nand weaknesses of his fellow-men. an alcibiades, a mirabeau, or a\\nnapoleon the first, are born either to be the authors of great evils in\\nstates, or ‘of great good, when they are drawn in that direction.’\\n\\nyet the thesis, ‘corruptio optimi pessima,’ cannot be maintained\\ngenerally or without regard to the kind of excellence which is\\ncorrupted. the alien conditions which are corrupting to one nature, may\\nbe the elements of culture to another. in general a man can only\\nreceive his highest development in a congenial state or family, among\\nfriends or fellow-workers. but also he may sometimes be stirred by\\nadverse circumstances to such a degree that he rises up against them\\nand reforms them. and while weaker or coarser characters will extract\\ngood out of evil, say in a corrupt state of the church or of society,\\nand live on happily, allowing the evil to remain, the finer or stronger\\nnatures may be crushed or spoiled by surrounding influences—may become\\nmisanthrope and philanthrope by turns; or in a few instances, like the\\nfounders of the monastic orders, or the reformers, owing to some\\npeculiarity in themselves or in their age, may break away entirely from\\nthe world and from the church, sometimes into great good, sometimes\\ninto great evil, sometimes into both. and the same holds in the lesser\\nsphere of a convent, a school, a family.\\n\\nplato would have us consider how easily the best natures are\\noverpowered by public opinion, and what efforts the rest of mankind\\nwill make to get possession of them. the world, the church, their own\\nprofession, any political or party organization, are always carrying\\nthem off their legs and teaching them to apply high and holy names to\\ntheir own prejudices and interests. the ‘monster’ corporation to which\\nthey belong judges right and truth to be the pleasure of the community.\\nthe individual becomes one with his order; or, if he resists, the world\\nis too much for him, and will sooner or later be revenged on him. this\\nis, perhaps, a one-sided but not wholly untrue picture of the maxims\\nand practice of mankind when they ‘sit down together at an assembly,’\\neither in ancient or modern times.\\n\\nwhen the higher natures are corrupted by politics, the lower take\\npossession of the vacant place of philosophy. this is described in one\\nof those continuous images in which the argument, to use a platonic\\nexpression, ‘veils herself,’ and which is dropped and reappears at\\nintervals. the question is asked,—why are the citizens of states so\\nhostile to philosophy? the answer is, that they do not know her. and\\nyet there is also a better mind of the many; they would believe if they\\nwere taught. but hitherto they have only known a conventional imitation\\nof philosophy, words without thoughts, systems which have no life in\\nthem; a (divine) person uttering the words of beauty and freedom, the\\nfriend of man holding communion with the eternal, and seeking to frame\\nthe state in that image, they have never known. the same double feeling\\nrespecting the mass of mankind has always existed among men. the first\\nthought is that the people are the enemies of truth and right; the\\nsecond, that this only arises out of an accidental error and confusion,\\nand that they do not really hate those who love them, if they could be\\neducated to know them.\\n\\nin the latter part of the sixth book, three questions have to be\\nconsidered: 1st, the nature of the longer and more circuitous way,\\nwhich is contrasted with the shorter and more imperfect method of book\\niv; 2nd, the heavenly pattern or idea of the state; 3rd, the relation\\nof the divisions of knowledge to one another and to the corresponding\\nfaculties of the soul:\\n\\n1. of the higher method of knowledge in plato we have only a glimpse.\\nneither here nor in the phaedrus or symposium, nor yet in the philebus\\nor sophist, does he give any clear explanation of his meaning. he would\\nprobably have described his method as proceeding by regular steps to a\\nsystem of universal knowledge, which inferred the parts from the whole\\nrather than the whole from the parts. this ideal logic is not practised\\nby him in the search after justice, or in the analysis of the parts of\\nthe soul; there, like aristotle in the nicomachean ethics, he argues\\nfrom experience and the common use of language. but at the end of the\\nsixth book he conceives another and more perfect method, in which all\\nideas are only steps or grades or moments of thought, forming a\\nconnected whole which is self-supporting, and in which consistency is\\nthe test of truth. he does not explain to us in detail the nature of\\nthe process. like many other thinkers both in ancient and modern times\\nhis mind seems to be filled with a vacant form which he is unable to\\nrealize. he supposes the sciences to have a natural order and connexion\\nin an age when they can hardly be said to exist. he is hastening on to\\nthe ‘end of the intellectual world’ without even making a beginning of\\nthem.\\n\\nin modern times we hardly need to be reminded that the process of\\nacquiring knowledge is here confused with the contemplation of absolute\\nknowledge. in all science a priori and a posteriori truths mingle in\\nvarious proportions. the a priori part is that which is derived from\\nthe most universal experience of men, or is universally accepted by\\nthem; the a posteriori is that which grows up around the more general\\nprinciples and becomes imperceptibly one with them. but plato\\nerroneously imagines that the synthesis is separable from the analysis,\\nand that the method of science can anticipate science. in entertaining\\nsuch a vision of a priori knowledge he is sufficiently justified, or at\\nleast his meaning may be sufficiently explained by the similar attempts\\nof descartes, kant, hegel, and even of bacon himself, in modern\\nphilosophy. anticipations or divinations, or prophetic glimpses of\\ntruths whether concerning man or nature, seem to stand in the same\\nrelation to ancient philosophy which hypotheses bear to modern\\ninductive science. these ‘guesses at truth’ were not made at random;\\nthey arose from a superficial impression of uniformities and first\\nprinciples in nature which the genius of the greek, contemplating the\\nexpanse of heaven and earth, seemed to recognize in the distance. nor\\ncan we deny that in ancient times knowledge must have stood still, and\\nthe human mind been deprived of the very instruments of thought, if\\nphilosophy had been strictly confined to the results of experience.\\n\\n2. plato supposes that when the tablet has been made blank the artist\\nwill fill in the lineaments of the ideal state. is this a pattern laid\\nup in heaven, or mere vacancy on which he is supposed to gaze with\\nwondering eye? the answer is, that such ideals are framed partly by the\\nomission of particulars, partly by imagination perfecting the form\\nwhich experience supplies (phaedo). plato represents these ideals in a\\nfigure as belonging to another world; and in modern times the idea will\\nsometimes seem to precede, at other times to co-operate with the hand\\nof the artist. as in science, so also in creative art, there is a\\nsynthetical as well as an analytical method. one man will have the\\nwhole in his mind before he begins; to another the processes of mind\\nand hand will be simultaneous.\\n\\n3. there is no difficulty in seeing that plato’s divisions of knowledge\\nare based, first, on the fundamental antithesis of sensible and\\nintellectual which pervades the whole pre-socratic philosophy; in which\\nis implied also the opposition of the permanent and transient, of the\\nuniversal and particular. but the age of philosophy in which he lived\\nseemed to require a further distinction;—numbers and figures were\\nbeginning to separate from ideas. the world could no longer regard\\njustice as a cube, and was learning to see, though imperfectly, that\\nthe abstractions of sense were distinct from the abstractions of mind.\\nbetween the eleatic being or essence and the shadows of phenomena, the\\npythagorean principle of number found a place, and was, as aristotle\\nremarks, a conducting medium from one to the other. hence plato is led\\nto introduce a third term which had not hitherto entered into the\\nscheme of his philosophy. he had observed the use of mathematics in\\neducation; they were the best preparation for higher studies. the\\nsubjective relation between them further suggested an objective one;\\nalthough the passage from one to the other is really imaginary\\n(metaph.). for metaphysical and moral philosophy has no connexion with\\nmathematics; number and figure are the abstractions of time and space,\\nnot the expressions of purely intellectual conceptions. when divested\\nof metaphor, a straight line or a square has no more to do with right\\nand justice than a crooked line with vice. the figurative association\\nwas mistaken for a real one; and thus the three latter divisions of the\\nplatonic proportion were constructed.\\n\\nthere is more difficulty in comprehending how he arrived at the first\\nterm of the series, which is nowhere else mentioned, and has no\\nreference to any other part of his system. nor indeed does the relation\\nof shadows to objects correspond to the relation of numbers to ideas.\\nprobably plato has been led by the love of analogy (timaeus) to make\\nfour terms instead of three, although the objects perceived in both\\ndivisions of the lower sphere are equally objects of sense. he is also\\npreparing the way, as his manner is, for the shadows of images at the\\nbeginning of the seventh book, and the imitation of an imitation in the\\ntenth. the line may be regarded as reaching from unity to infinity, and\\nis divided into two unequal parts, and subdivided into two more; each\\nlower sphere is the multiplication of the preceding. of the four\\nfaculties, faith in the lower division has an intermediate position\\n(cp. for the use of the word faith or belief, (greek), timaeus),\\ncontrasting equally with the vagueness of the perception of shadows\\n(greek) and the higher certainty of understanding (greek) and reason\\n(greek).\\n\\nthe difference between understanding and mind or reason (greek) is\\nanalogous to the difference between acquiring knowledge in the parts\\nand the contemplation of the whole. true knowledge is a whole, and is\\nat rest; consistency and universality are the tests of truth. to this\\nself-evidencing knowledge of the whole the faculty of mind is supposed\\nto correspond. but there is a knowledge of the understanding which is\\nincomplete and in motion always, because unable to rest in the\\nsubordinate ideas. those ideas are called both images and\\nhypotheses—images because they are clothed in sense, hypotheses because\\nthey are assumptions only, until they are brought into connexion with\\nthe idea of good.\\n\\nthe general meaning of the passage, ‘noble, then, is the bond which\\nlinks together sight...and of this kind i spoke as the intelligible...’\\nso far as the thought contained in it admits of being translated into\\nthe terms of modern philosophy, may be described or explained as\\nfollows:—there is a truth, one and self-existent, to which by the help\\nof a ladder let down from above, the human intelligence may ascend.\\nthis unity is like the sun in the heavens, the light by which all\\nthings are seen, the being by which they are created and sustained. it\\nis the idea of good. and the steps of the ladder leading up to this\\nhighest or universal existence are the mathematical sciences, which\\nalso contain in themselves an element of the universal. these, too, we\\nsee in a new manner when we connect them with the idea of good. they\\nthen cease to be hypotheses or pictures, and become essential parts of\\na higher truth which is at once their first principle and their final\\ncause.\\n\\nwe cannot give any more precise meaning to this remarkable passage, but\\nwe may trace in it several rudiments or vestiges of thought which are\\ncommon to us and to plato: such as (1) the unity and correlation of the\\nsciences, or rather of science, for in plato’s time they were not yet\\nparted off or distinguished; (2) the existence of a divine power, or\\nlife or idea or cause or reason, not yet conceived or no longer\\nconceived as in the timaeus and elsewhere under the form of a person;\\n(3) the recognition of the hypothetical and conditional character of\\nthe mathematical sciences, and in a measure of every science when\\nisolated from the rest; (4) the conviction of a truth which is\\ninvisible, and of a law, though hardly a law of nature, which permeates\\nthe intellectual rather than the visible world.\\n\\nthe method of socrates is hesitating and tentative, awaiting the fuller\\nexplanation of the idea of good, and of the nature of dialectic in the\\nseventh book. the imperfect intelligence of glaucon, and the reluctance\\nof socrates to make a beginning, mark the difficulty of the subject.\\nthe allusion to theages’ bridle, and to the internal oracle, or demonic\\nsign, of socrates, which here, as always in plato, is only prohibitory;\\nthe remark that the salvation of any remnant of good in the present\\nevil state of the world is due to god only; the reference to a future\\nstate of existence, which is unknown to glaucon in the tenth book, and\\nin which the discussions of socrates and his disciples would be\\nresumed; the surprise in the answers; the fanciful irony of socrates,\\nwhere he pretends that he can only describe the strange position of the\\nphilosopher in a figure of speech; the original observation that the\\nsophists, after all, are only the representatives and not the leaders\\nof public opinion; the picture of the philosopher standing aside in the\\nshower of sleet under a wall; the figure of ‘the great beast’ followed\\nby the expression of good-will towards the common people who would not\\nhave rejected the philosopher if they had known him; the ‘right noble\\nthought’ that the highest truths demand the greatest exactness; the\\nhesitation of socrates in returning once more to his well-worn theme of\\nthe idea of good; the ludicrous earnestness of glaucon; the comparison\\nof philosophy to a deserted maiden who marries beneath her—are some of\\nthe most interesting characteristics of the sixth book.\\n\\nyet a few more words may be added, on the old theme, which was so oft\\ndiscussed in the socratic circle, of which we, like glaucon and\\nadeimantus, would fain, if possible, have a clearer notion. like them,\\nwe are dissatisfied when we are told that the idea of good can only be\\nrevealed to a student of the mathematical sciences, and we are inclined\\nto think that neither we nor they could have been led along that path\\nto any satisfactory goal. for we have learned that differences of\\nquantity cannot pass into differences of quality, and that the\\nmathematical sciences can never rise above themselves into the sphere\\nof our higher thoughts, although they may sometimes furnish symbols and\\nexpressions of them, and may train the mind in habits of abstraction\\nand self-concentration. the illusion which was natural to an ancient\\nphilosopher has ceased to be an illusion to us. but if the process by\\nwhich we are supposed to arrive at the idea of good be really\\nimaginary, may not the idea itself be also a mere abstraction? we\\nremark, first, that in all ages, and especially in primitive\\nphilosophy, words such as being, essence, unity, good, have exerted an\\nextraordinary influence over the minds of men. the meagreness or\\nnegativeness of their content has been in an inverse ratio to their\\npower. they have become the forms under which all things were\\ncomprehended. there was a need or instinct in the human soul which they\\nsatisfied; they were not ideas, but gods, and to this new mythology the\\nmen of a later generation began to attach the powers and associations\\nof the elder deities.\\n\\nthe idea of good is one of those sacred words or forms of thought,\\nwhich were beginning to take the place of the old mythology. it meant\\nunity, in which all time and all existence were gathered up. it was the\\ntruth of all things, and also the light in which they shone forth, and\\nbecame evident to intelligences human and divine. it was the cause of\\nall things, the power by which they were brought into being. it was the\\nuniversal reason divested of a human personality. it was the life as\\nwell as the light of the world, all knowledge and all power were\\ncomprehended in it. the way to it was through the mathematical\\nsciences, and these too were dependent on it. to ask whether god was\\nthe maker of it, or made by it, would be like asking whether god could\\nbe conceived apart from goodness, or goodness apart from god. the god\\nof the timaeus is not really at variance with the idea of good; they\\nare aspects of the same, differing only as the personal from the\\nimpersonal, or the masculine from the neuter, the one being the\\nexpression or language of mythology, the other of philosophy.\\n\\nthis, or something like this, is the meaning of the idea of good as\\nconceived by plato. ideas of number, order, harmony, development may\\nalso be said to enter into it. the paraphrase which has just been given\\nof it goes beyond the actual words of plato. we have perhaps arrived at\\nthe stage of philosophy which enables us to understand what he is\\naiming at, better than he did himself. we are beginning to realize what\\nhe saw darkly and at a distance. but if he could have been told that\\nthis, or some conception of the same kind, but higher than this, was\\nthe truth at which he was aiming, and the need which he sought to\\nsupply, he would gladly have recognized that more was contained in his\\nown thoughts than he himself knew. as his words are few and his manner\\nreticent and tentative, so must the style of his interpreter be. we\\nshould not approach his meaning more nearly by attempting to define it\\nfurther. in translating him into the language of modern thought, we\\nmight insensibly lose the spirit of ancient philosophy. it is\\nremarkable that although plato speaks of the idea of good as the first\\nprinciple of truth and being, it is nowhere mentioned in his writings\\nexcept in this passage. nor did it retain any hold upon the minds of\\nhis disciples in a later generation; it was probably unintelligible to\\nthem. nor does the mention of it in aristotle appear to have any\\nreference to this or any other passage in his extant writings.\\n\\nbook vii. and now i will describe in a figure the enlightenment or\\nunenlightenment of our nature:—imagine human beings living in an\\nunderground den which is open towards the light; they have been there\\nfrom childhood, having their necks and legs chained, and can only see\\ninto the den. at a distance there is a fire, and between the fire and\\nthe prisoners a raised way, and a low wall is built along the way, like\\nthe screen over which marionette players show their puppets. behind the\\nwall appear moving figures, who hold in their hands various works of\\nart, and among them images of men and animals, wood and stone, and some\\nof the passers-by are talking and others silent. ‘a strange parable,’\\nhe said, ‘and strange captives.’ they are ourselves, i replied; and\\nthey see only the shadows of the images which the fire throws on the\\nwall of the den; to these they give names, and if we add an echo which\\nreturns from the wall, the voices of the passengers will seem to\\nproceed from the shadows. suppose now that you suddenly turn them round\\nand make them look with pain and grief to themselves at the real\\nimages; will they believe them to be real? will not their eyes be\\ndazzled, and will they not try to get away from the light to something\\nwhich they are able to behold without blinking? and suppose further,\\nthat they are dragged up a steep and rugged ascent into the presence of\\nthe sun himself, will not their sight be darkened with the excess of\\nlight? some time will pass before they get the habit of perceiving at\\nall; and at first they will be able to perceive only shadows and\\nreflections in the water; then they will recognize the moon and the\\nstars, and will at length behold the sun in his own proper place as he\\nis. last of all they will conclude:—this is he who gives us the year\\nand the seasons, and is the author of all that we see. how will they\\nrejoice in passing from darkness to light! how worthless to them will\\nseem the honours and glories of the den! but now imagine further, that\\nthey descend into their old habitations;—in that underground dwelling\\nthey will not see as well as their fellows, and will not be able to\\ncompete with them in the measurement of the shadows on the wall; there\\nwill be many jokes about the man who went on a visit to the sun and\\nlost his eyes, and if they find anybody trying to set free and\\nenlighten one of their number, they will put him to death, if they can\\ncatch him. now the cave or den is the world of sight, the fire is the\\nsun, the way upwards is the way to knowledge, and in the world of\\nknowledge the idea of good is last seen and with difficulty, but when\\nseen is inferred to be the author of good and right—parent of the lord\\nof light in this world, and of truth and understanding in the other. he\\nwho attains to the beatific vision is always going upwards; he is\\nunwilling to descend into political assemblies and courts of law; for\\nhis eyes are apt to blink at the images or shadows of images which they\\nbehold in them—he cannot enter into the ideas of those who have never\\nin their lives understood the relation of the shadow to the substance.\\nbut blindness is of two kinds, and may be caused either by passing out\\nof darkness into light or out of light into darkness, and a man of\\nsense will distinguish between them, and will not laugh equally at both\\nof them, but the blindness which arises from fulness of light he will\\ndeem blessed, and pity the other; or if he laugh at the puzzled soul\\nlooking at the sun, he will have more reason to laugh than the\\ninhabitants of the den at those who descend from above. there is a\\nfurther lesson taught by this parable of ours. some persons fancy that\\ninstruction is like giving eyes to the blind, but we say that the\\nfaculty of sight was always there, and that the soul only requires to\\nbe turned round towards the light. and this is conversion; other\\nvirtues are almost like bodily habits, and may be acquired in the same\\nmanner, but intelligence has a diviner life, and is indestructible,\\nturning either to good or evil according to the direction given. did\\nyou never observe how the mind of a clever rogue peers out of his eyes,\\nand the more clearly he sees, the more evil he does? now if you take\\nsuch an one, and cut away from him those leaden weights of pleasure and\\ndesire which bind his soul to earth, his intelligence will be turned\\nround, and he will behold the truth as clearly as he now discerns his\\nmeaner ends. and have we not decided that our rulers must neither be so\\nuneducated as to have no fixed rule of life, nor so over-educated as to\\nbe unwilling to leave their paradise for the business of the world? we\\nmust choose out therefore the natures who are most likely to ascend to\\nthe light and knowledge of the good; but we must not allow them to\\nremain in the region of light; they must be forced down again among the\\ncaptives in the den to partake of their labours and honours. ‘will they\\nnot think this a hardship?’ you should remember that our purpose in\\nframing the state was not that our citizens should do what they like,\\nbut that they should serve the state for the common good of all. may we\\nnot fairly say to our philosopher,—friend, we do you no wrong; for in\\nother states philosophy grows wild, and a wild plant owes nothing to\\nthe gardener, but you have been trained by us to be the rulers and\\nkings of our hive, and therefore we must insist on your descending into\\nthe den. you must, each of you, take your turn, and become able to use\\nyour eyes in the dark, and with a little practice you will see far\\nbetter than those who quarrel about the shadows, whose knowledge is a\\ndream only, whilst yours is a waking reality. it may be that the saint\\nor philosopher who is best fitted, may also be the least inclined to\\nrule, but necessity is laid upon him, and he must no longer live in the\\nheaven of ideas. and this will be the salvation of the state. for those\\nwho rule must not be those who are desirous to rule; and, if you can\\noffer to our citizens a better life than that of rulers generally is,\\nthere will be a chance that the rich, not only in this world’s goods,\\nbut in virtue and wisdom, may bear rule. and the only life which is\\nbetter than the life of political ambition is that of philosophy, which\\nis also the best preparation for the government of a state.\\n\\nthen now comes the question,—how shall we create our rulers; what way\\nis there from darkness to light? the change is effected by philosophy;\\nit is not the turning over of an oyster-shell, but the conversion of a\\nsoul from night to day, from becoming to being. and what training will\\ndraw the soul upwards? our former education had two branches,\\ngymnastic, which was occupied with the body, and music, the sister art,\\nwhich infused a natural harmony into mind and literature; but neither\\nof these sciences gave any promise of doing what we want. nothing\\nremains to us but that universal or primary science of which all the\\narts and sciences are partakers, i mean number or calculation. ‘very\\ntrue.’ including the art of war? ‘yes, certainly.’ then there is\\nsomething ludicrous about palamedes in the tragedy, coming in and\\nsaying that he had invented number, and had counted the ranks and set\\nthem in order. for if agamemnon could not count his feet (and without\\nnumber how could he?) he must have been a pretty sort of general\\nindeed. no man should be a soldier who cannot count, and indeed he is\\nhardly to be called a man. but i am not speaking of these practical\\napplications of arithmetic, for number, in my view, is rather to be\\nregarded as a conductor to thought and being. i will explain what i\\nmean by the last expression:—things sensible are of two kinds; the one\\nclass invite or stimulate the mind, while in the other the mind\\nacquiesces. now the stimulating class are the things which suggest\\ncontrast and relation. for example, suppose that i hold up to the eyes\\nthree fingers—a fore finger, a middle finger, a little finger—the sight\\nequally recognizes all three fingers, but without number cannot further\\ndistinguish them. or again, suppose two objects to be relatively great\\nand small, these ideas of greatness and smallness are supplied not by\\nthe sense, but by the mind. and the perception of their contrast or\\nrelation quickens and sets in motion the mind, which is puzzled by the\\nconfused intimations of sense, and has recourse to number in order to\\nfind out whether the things indicated are one or more than one. number\\nreplies that they are two and not one, and are to be distinguished from\\none another. again, the sight beholds great and small, but only in a\\nconfused chaos, and not until they are distinguished does the question\\narise of their respective natures; we are thus led on to the\\ndistinction between the visible and intelligible. that was what i meant\\nwhen i spoke of stimulants to the intellect; i was thinking of the\\ncontradictions which arise in perception. the idea of unity, for\\nexample, like that of a finger, does not arouse thought unless\\ninvolving some conception of plurality; but when the one is also the\\nopposite of one, the contradiction gives rise to reflection; an example\\nof this is afforded by any object of sight. all number has also an\\nelevating effect; it raises the mind out of the foam and flux of\\ngeneration to the contemplation of being, having lesser military and\\nretail uses also. the retail use is not required by us; but as our\\nguardian is to be a soldier as well as a philosopher, the military one\\nmay be retained. and to our higher purpose no science can be better\\nadapted; but it must be pursued in the spirit of a philosopher, not of\\na shopkeeper. it is concerned, not with visible objects, but with\\nabstract truth; for numbers are pure abstractions—the true\\narithmetician indignantly denies that his unit is capable of division.\\nwhen you divide, he insists that you are only multiplying; his ‘one’ is\\nnot material or resolvable into fractions, but an unvarying and\\nabsolute equality; and this proves the purely intellectual character of\\nhis study. note also the great power which arithmetic has of sharpening\\nthe wits; no other discipline is equally severe, or an equal test of\\ngeneral ability, or equally improving to a stupid person.\\n\\nlet our second branch of education be geometry. ‘i can easily see,’\\nreplied glaucon, ‘that the skill of the general will be doubled by his\\nknowledge of geometry.’ that is a small matter; the use of geometry, to\\nwhich i refer, is the assistance given by it in the contemplation of\\nthe idea of good, and the compelling the mind to look at true being,\\nand not at generation only. yet the present mode of pursuing these\\nstudies, as any one who is the least of a mathematician is aware, is\\nmean and ridiculous; they are made to look downwards to the arts, and\\nnot upwards to eternal existence. the geometer is always talking of\\nsquaring, subtending, apposing, as if he had in view action; whereas\\nknowledge is the real object of the study. it should elevate the soul,\\nand create the mind of philosophy; it should raise up what has fallen\\ndown, not to speak of lesser uses in war and military tactics, and in\\nthe improvement of the faculties.\\n\\nshall we propose, as a third branch of our education, astronomy? ‘very\\ngood,’ replied glaucon; ‘the knowledge of the heavens is necessary at\\nonce for husbandry, navigation, military tactics.’ i like your way of\\ngiving useful reasons for everything in order to make friends of the\\nworld. and there is a difficulty in proving to mankind that education\\nis not only useful information but a purification of the eye of the\\nsoul, which is better than the bodily eye, for by this alone is truth\\nseen. now, will you appeal to mankind in general or to the philosopher?\\nor would you prefer to look to yourself only? ‘every man is his own\\nbest friend.’ then take a step backward, for we are out of order, and\\ninsert the third dimension which is of solids, after the second which\\nis of planes, and then you may proceed to solids in motion. but solid\\ngeometry is not popular and has not the patronage of the state, nor is\\nthe use of it fully recognized; the difficulty is great, and the\\nvotaries of the study are conceited and impatient. still the charm of\\nthe pursuit wins upon men, and, if government would lend a little\\nassistance, there might be great progress made. ‘very true,’ replied\\nglaucon; ‘but do i understand you now to begin with plane geometry, and\\nto place next geometry of solids, and thirdly, astronomy, or the motion\\nof solids?’ yes, i said; my hastiness has only hindered us.\\n\\n‘very good, and now let us proceed to astronomy, about which i am\\nwilling to speak in your lofty strain. no one can fail to see that the\\ncontemplation of the heavens draws the soul upwards.’ i am an\\nexception, then; astronomy as studied at present appears to me to draw\\nthe soul not upwards, but downwards. star-gazing is just looking up at\\nthe ceiling—no better; a man may lie on his back on land or on water—he\\nmay look up or look down, but there is no science in that. the vision\\nof knowledge of which i speak is seen not with the eyes, but with the\\nmind. all the magnificence of the heavens is but the embroidery of a\\ncopy which falls far short of the divine original, and teaches nothing\\nabout the absolute harmonies or motions of things. their beauty is like\\nthe beauty of figures drawn by the hand of daedalus or any other great\\nartist, which may be used for illustration, but no mathematician would\\nseek to obtain from them true conceptions of equality or numerical\\nrelations. how ridiculous then to look for these in the map of the\\nheavens, in which the imperfection of matter comes in everywhere as a\\ndisturbing element, marring the symmetry of day and night, of months\\nand years, of the sun and stars in their courses. only by problems can\\nwe place astronomy on a truly scientific basis. let the heavens alone,\\nand exert the intellect.\\n\\nstill, mathematics admit of other applications, as the pythagoreans\\nsay, and we agree. there is a sister science of harmonical motion,\\nadapted to the ear as astronomy is to the eye, and there may be other\\napplications also. let us inquire of the pythagoreans about them, not\\nforgetting that we have an aim higher than theirs, which is the\\nrelation of these sciences to the idea of good. the error which\\npervades astronomy also pervades harmonics. the musicians put their\\nears in the place of their minds. ‘yes,’ replied glaucon, ‘i like to\\nsee them laying their ears alongside of their neighbours’ faces—some\\nsaying, “that’s a new note,” others declaring that the two notes are\\nthe same.’ yes, i said; but you mean the empirics who are always\\ntwisting and torturing the strings of the lyre, and quarrelling about\\nthe tempers of the strings; i am referring rather to the pythagorean\\nharmonists, who are almost equally in error. for they investigate only\\nthe numbers of the consonances which are heard, and ascend no\\nhigher,—of the true numerical harmony which is unheard, and is only to\\nbe found in problems, they have not even a conception. ‘that last,’ he\\nsaid, ‘must be a marvellous thing.’ a thing, i replied, which is only\\nuseful if pursued with a view to the good.\\n\\nall these sciences are the prelude of the strain, and are profitable if\\nthey are regarded in their natural relations to one another. ‘i dare\\nsay, socrates,’ said glaucon; ‘but such a study will be an endless\\nbusiness.’ what study do you mean—of the prelude, or what? for all\\nthese things are only the prelude, and you surely do not suppose that a\\nmere mathematician is also a dialectician? ‘certainly not. i have\\nhardly ever known a mathematician who could reason.’ and yet, glaucon,\\nis not true reasoning that hymn of dialectic which is the music of the\\nintellectual world, and which was by us compared to the effort of\\nsight, when from beholding the shadows on the wall we arrived at last\\nat the images which gave the shadows? even so the dialectical faculty\\nwithdrawing from sense arrives by the pure intellect at the\\ncontemplation of the idea of good, and never rests but at the very end\\nof the intellectual world. and the royal road out of the cave into the\\nlight, and the blinking of the eyes at the sun and turning to\\ncontemplate the shadows of reality, not the shadows of an image\\nonly—this progress and gradual acquisition of a new faculty of sight by\\nthe help of the mathematical sciences, is the elevation of the soul to\\nthe contemplation of the highest ideal of being.\\n\\n‘so far, i agree with you. but now, leaving the prelude, let us proceed\\nto the hymn. what, then, is the nature of dialectic, and what are the\\npaths which lead thither?’ dear glaucon, you cannot follow me here.\\nthere can be no revelation of the absolute truth to one who has not\\nbeen disciplined in the previous sciences. but that there is a science\\nof absolute truth, which is attained in some way very different from\\nthose now practised, i am confident. for all other arts or sciences are\\nrelative to human needs and opinions; and the mathematical sciences are\\nbut a dream or hypothesis of true being, and never analyse their own\\nprinciples. dialectic alone rises to the principle which is above\\nhypotheses, converting and gently leading the eye of the soul out of\\nthe barbarous slough of ignorance into the light of the upper world,\\nwith the help of the sciences which we have been describing—sciences,\\nas they are often termed, although they require some other name,\\nimplying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than\\nscience, and this in our previous sketch was understanding. and so we\\nget four names—two for intellect, and two for opinion,—reason or mind,\\nunderstanding, faith, perception of shadows—which make a proportion—\\nbeing:becoming::intellect:opinion—and science:belief::understanding:\\nperception of shadows. dialectic may be further described as that\\nscience which defines and explains the essence or being of each nature,\\nwhich distinguishes and abstracts the good, and is ready to do battle\\nagainst all opponents in the cause of good. to him who is not a\\ndialectician life is but a sleepy dream; and many a man is in his grave\\nbefore his is well waked up. and would you have the future rulers of\\nyour ideal state intelligent beings, or stupid as posts? ‘certainly not\\nthe latter.’ then you must train them in dialectic, which will teach\\nthem to ask and answer questions, and is the coping-stone of the\\nsciences.\\n\\ni dare say that you have not forgotten how our rulers were chosen; and\\nthe process of selection may be carried a step further:—as before, they\\nmust be constant and valiant, good-looking, and of noble manners, but\\nnow they must also have natural ability which education will improve;\\nthat is to say, they must be quick at learning, capable of mental toil,\\nretentive, solid, diligent natures, who combine intellectual with moral\\nvirtues; not lame and one-sided, diligent in bodily exercise and\\nindolent in mind, or conversely; not a maimed soul, which hates\\nfalsehood and yet unintentionally is always wallowing in the mire of\\nignorance; not a bastard or feeble person, but sound in wind and limb,\\nand in perfect condition for the great gymnastic trial of the mind.\\njustice herself can find no fault with natures such as these; and they\\nwill be the saviours of our state; disciples of another sort would only\\nmake philosophy more ridiculous than she is at present. forgive my\\nenthusiasm; i am becoming excited; but when i see her trampled\\nunderfoot, i am angry at the authors of her disgrace. ‘i did not notice\\nthat you were more excited than you ought to have been.’ but i felt\\nthat i was. now do not let us forget another point in the selection of\\nour disciples—that they must be young and not old. for solon is\\nmistaken in saying that an old man can be always learning; youth is the\\ntime of study, and here we must remember that the mind is free and\\ndainty, and, unlike the body, must not be made to work against the\\ngrain. learning should be at first a sort of play, in which the natural\\nbent is detected. as in training them for war, the young dogs should at\\nfirst only taste blood; but when the necessary gymnastics are over\\nwhich during two or three years divide life between sleep and bodily\\nexercise, then the education of the soul will become a more serious\\nmatter. at twenty years of age, a selection must be made of the more\\npromising disciples, with whom a new epoch of education will begin. the\\nsciences which they have hitherto learned in fragments will now be\\nbrought into relation with each other and with true being; for the\\npower of combining them is the test of speculative and dialectical\\nability. and afterwards at thirty a further selection shall be made of\\nthose who are able to withdraw from the world of sense into the\\nabstraction of ideas. but at this point, judging from present\\nexperience, there is a danger that dialectic may be the source of many\\nevils. the danger may be illustrated by a parallel case:—imagine a\\nperson who has been brought up in wealth and luxury amid a crowd of\\nflatterers, and who is suddenly informed that he is a supposititious\\nson. he has hitherto honoured his reputed parents and disregarded the\\nflatterers, and now he does the reverse. this is just what happens with\\na man’s principles. there are certain doctrines which he learnt at home\\nand which exercised a parental authority over him. presently he finds\\nthat imputations are cast upon them; a troublesome querist comes and\\nasks, ‘what is the just and good?’ or proves that virtue is vice and\\nvice virtue, and his mind becomes unsettled, and he ceases to love,\\nhonour, and obey them as he has hitherto done. he is seduced into the\\nlife of pleasure, and becomes a lawless person and a rogue. the case of\\nsuch speculators is very pitiable, and, in order that our thirty years’\\nold pupils may not require this pity, let us take every possible care\\nthat young persons do not study philosophy too early. for a young man\\nis a sort of puppy who only plays with an argument; and is reasoned\\ninto and out of his opinions every day; he soon begins to believe\\nnothing, and brings himself and philosophy into discredit. a man of\\nthirty does not run on in this way; he will argue and not merely\\ncontradict, and adds new honour to philosophy by the sobriety of his\\nconduct. what time shall we allow for this second gymnastic training of\\nthe soul?—say, twice the time required for the gymnastics of the body;\\nsix, or perhaps five years, to commence at thirty, and then for fifteen\\nyears let the student go down into the den, and command armies, and\\ngain experience of life. at fifty let him return to the end of all\\nthings, and have his eyes uplifted to the idea of good, and order his\\nlife after that pattern; if necessary, taking his turn at the helm of\\nstate, and training up others to be his successors. when his time comes\\nhe shall depart in peace to the islands of the blest. he shall be\\nhonoured with sacrifices, and receive such worship as the pythian\\noracle approves.\\n\\n‘you are a statuary, socrates, and have made a perfect image of our\\ngovernors.’ yes, and of our governesses, for the women will share in\\nall things with the men. and you will admit that our state is not a\\nmere aspiration, but may really come into being when there shall arise\\nphilosopher-kings, one or more, who will despise earthly vanities, and\\nwill be the servants of justice only. ‘and how will they begin their\\nwork?’ their first act will be to send away into the country all those\\nwho are more than ten years of age, and to proceed with those who are\\nleft...\\n\\nat the commencement of the sixth book, plato anticipated his\\nexplanation of the relation of the philosopher to the world in an\\nallegory, in this, as in other passages, following the order which he\\nprescribes in education, and proceeding from the concrete to the\\nabstract. at the commencement of book vii, under the figure of a cave\\nhaving an opening towards a fire and a way upwards to the true light,\\nhe returns to view the divisions of knowledge, exhibiting familiarly,\\nas in a picture, the result which had been hardly won by a great effort\\nof thought in the previous discussion; at the same time casting a\\nglance onward at the dialectical process, which is represented by the\\nway leading from darkness to light. the shadows, the images, the\\nreflection of the sun and stars in the water, the stars and sun\\nthemselves, severally correspond,—the first, to the realm of fancy and\\npoetry,—the second, to the world of sense,—the third, to the\\nabstractions or universals of sense, of which the mathematical sciences\\nfurnish the type,—the fourth and last to the same abstractions, when\\nseen in the unity of the idea, from which they derive a new meaning and\\npower. the true dialectical process begins with the contemplation of\\nthe real stars, and not mere reflections of them, and ends with the\\nrecognition of the sun, or idea of good, as the parent not only of\\nlight but of warmth and growth. to the divisions of knowledge the\\nstages of education partly answer:—first, there is the early education\\nof childhood and youth in the fancies of the poets, and in the laws and\\ncustoms of the state;—then there is the training of the body to be a\\nwarrior athlete, and a good servant of the mind;—and thirdly, after an\\ninterval follows the education of later life, which begins with\\nmathematics and proceeds to philosophy in general.\\n\\nthere seem to be two great aims in the philosophy of plato,—first, to\\nrealize abstractions; secondly, to connect them. according to him, the\\ntrue education is that which draws men from becoming to being, and to a\\ncomprehensive survey of all being. he desires to develop in the human\\nmind the faculty of seeing the universal in all things; until at last\\nthe particulars of sense drop away and the universal alone remains. he\\nthen seeks to combine the universals which he has disengaged from\\nsense, not perceiving that the correlation of them has no other basis\\nbut the common use of language. he never understands that abstractions,\\nas hegel says, are ‘mere abstractions’—of use when employed in the\\narrangement of facts, but adding nothing to the sum of knowledge when\\npursued apart from them, or with reference to an imaginary idea of\\ngood. still the exercise of the faculty of abstraction apart from facts\\nhas enlarged the mind, and played a great part in the education of the\\nhuman race. plato appreciated the value of this faculty, and saw that\\nit might be quickened by the study of number and relation. all things\\nin which there is opposition or proportion are suggestive of\\nreflection. the mere impression of sense evokes no power of thought or\\nof mind, but when sensible objects ask to be compared and\\ndistinguished, then philosophy begins. the science of arithmetic first\\nsuggests such distinctions. the follow in order the other sciences of\\nplain and solid geometry, and of solids in motion, one branch of which\\nis astronomy or the harmony of the spheres,—to this is appended the\\nsister science of the harmony of sounds. plato seems also to hint at\\nthe possibility of other applications of arithmetical or mathematical\\nproportions, such as we employ in chemistry and natural philosophy,\\nsuch as the pythagoreans and even aristotle make use of in ethics and\\npolitics, e.g. his distinction between arithmetical and geometrical\\nproportion in the ethics (book v), or between numerical and\\nproportional equality in the politics.\\n\\nthe modern mathematician will readily sympathise with plato’s delight\\nin the properties of pure mathematics. he will not be disinclined to\\nsay with him:—let alone the heavens, and study the beauties of number\\nand figure in themselves. he too will be apt to depreciate their\\napplication to the arts. he will observe that plato has a conception of\\ngeometry, in which figures are to be dispensed with; thus in a distant\\nand shadowy way seeming to anticipate the possibility of working\\ngeometrical problems by a more general mode of analysis. he will remark\\nwith interest on the backward state of solid geometry, which, alas! was\\nnot encouraged by the aid of the state in the age of plato; and he will\\nrecognize the grasp of plato’s mind in his ability to conceive of one\\nscience of solids in motion including the earth as well as the\\nheavens,—not forgetting to notice the intimation to which allusion has\\nbeen already made, that besides astronomy and harmonics the science of\\nsolids in motion may have other applications. still more will he be\\nstruck with the comprehensiveness of view which led plato, at a time\\nwhen these sciences hardly existed, to say that they must be studied in\\nrelation to one another, and to the idea of good, or common principle\\nof truth and being. but he will also see (and perhaps without surprise)\\nthat in that stage of physical and mathematical knowledge, plato has\\nfallen into the error of supposing that he can construct the heavens a\\npriori by mathematical problems, and determine the principles of\\nharmony irrespective of the adaptation of sounds to the human ear. the\\nillusion was a natural one in that age and country. the simplicity and\\ncertainty of astronomy and harmonics seemed to contrast with the\\nvariation and complexity of the world of sense; hence the circumstance\\nthat there was some elementary basis of fact, some measurement of\\ndistance or time or vibrations on which they must ultimately rest, was\\noverlooked by him. the modern predecessors of newton fell into errors\\nequally great; and plato can hardly be said to have been very far\\nwrong, or may even claim a sort of prophetic insight into the subject,\\nwhen we consider that the greater part of astronomy at the present day\\nconsists of abstract dynamics, by the help of which most astronomical\\ndiscoveries have been made.\\n\\nthe metaphysical philosopher from his point of view recognizes\\nmathematics as an instrument of education,—which strengthens the power\\nof attention, developes the sense of order and the faculty of\\nconstruction, and enables the mind to grasp under simple formulae the\\nquantitative differences of physical phenomena. but while acknowledging\\ntheir value in education, he sees also that they have no connexion with\\nour higher moral and intellectual ideas. in the attempt which plato\\nmakes to connect them, we easily trace the influences of ancient\\npythagorean notions. there is no reason to suppose that he is speaking\\nof the ideal numbers; but he is describing numbers which are pure\\nabstractions, to which he assigns a real and separate existence, which,\\nas ‘the teachers of the art’ (meaning probably the pythagoreans) would\\nhave affirmed, repel all attempts at subdivision, and in which unity\\nand every other number are conceived of as absolute. the truth and\\ncertainty of numbers, when thus disengaged from phenomena, gave them a\\nkind of sacredness in the eyes of an ancient philosopher. nor is it\\neasy to say how far ideas of order and fixedness may have had a moral\\nand elevating influence on the minds of men, ‘who,’ in the words of the\\ntimaeus, ‘might learn to regulate their erring lives according to\\nthem.’ it is worthy of remark that the old pythagorean ethical symbols\\nstill exist as figures of speech among ourselves. and those who in\\nmodern times see the world pervaded by universal law, may also see an\\nanticipation of this last word of modern philosophy in the platonic\\nidea of good, which is the source and measure of all things, and yet\\nonly an abstraction (philebus).\\n\\ntwo passages seem to require more particular explanations. first, that\\nwhich relates to the analysis of vision. the difficulty in this passage\\nmay be explained, like many others, from differences in the modes of\\nconception prevailing among ancient and modern thinkers. to us, the\\nperceptions of sense are inseparable from the act of the mind which\\naccompanies them. the consciousness of form, colour, distance, is\\nindistinguishable from the simple sensation, which is the medium of\\nthem. whereas to plato sense is the heraclitean flux of sense, not the\\nvision of objects in the order in which they actually present\\nthemselves to the experienced sight, but as they may be imagined to\\nappear confused and blurred to the half-awakened eye of the infant. the\\nfirst action of the mind is aroused by the attempt to set in order this\\nchaos, and the reason is required to frame distinct conceptions under\\nwhich the confused impressions of sense may be arranged. hence arises\\nthe question, ‘what is great, what is small?’ and thus begins the\\ndistinction of the visible and the intelligible.\\n\\nthe second difficulty relates to plato’s conception of harmonics. three\\nclasses of harmonists are distinguished by him:—first, the\\npythagoreans, whom he proposes to consult as in the previous discussion\\non music he was to consult damon—they are acknowledged to be masters in\\nthe art, but are altogether deficient in the knowledge of its higher\\nimport and relation to the good; secondly, the mere empirics, whom\\nglaucon appears to confuse with them, and whom both he and socrates\\nludicrously describe as experimenting by mere auscultation on the\\nintervals of sounds. both of these fall short in different degrees of\\nthe platonic idea of harmony, which must be studied in a purely\\nabstract way, first by the method of problems, and secondly as a part\\nof universal knowledge in relation to the idea of good.\\n\\nthe allegory has a political as well as a philosophical meaning. the\\nden or cave represents the narrow sphere of politics or law (compare\\nthe description of the philosopher and lawyer in the theaetetus), and\\nthe light of the eternal ideas is supposed to exercise a disturbing\\ninfluence on the minds of those who return to this lower world. in\\nother words, their principles are too wide for practical application;\\nthey are looking far away into the past and future, when their business\\nis with the present. the ideal is not easily reduced to the conditions\\nof actual life, and may often be at variance with them. and at first,\\nthose who return are unable to compete with the inhabitants of the den\\nin the measurement of the shadows, and are derided and persecuted by\\nthem; but after a while they see the things below in far truer\\nproportions than those who have never ascended into the upper world.\\nthe difference between the politician turned into a philosopher and the\\nphilosopher turned into a politician, is symbolized by the two kinds of\\ndisordered eyesight, the one which is experienced by the captive who is\\ntransferred from darkness to day, the other, of the heavenly messenger\\nwho voluntarily for the good of his fellow-men descends into the den.\\nin what way the brighter light is to dawn on the inhabitants of the\\nlower world, or how the idea of good is to become the guiding principle\\nof politics, is left unexplained by plato. like the nature and\\ndivisions of dialectic, of which glaucon impatiently demands to be\\ninformed, perhaps he would have said that the explanation could not be\\ngiven except to a disciple of the previous sciences. (symposium.)\\n\\nmany illustrations of this part of the republic may be found in modern\\npolitics and in daily life. for among ourselves, too, there have been\\ntwo sorts of politicians or statesmen, whose eyesight has become\\ndisordered in two different ways. first, there have been great men who,\\nin the language of burke, ‘have been too much given to general maxims,’\\nwho, like j.s. mill or burke himself, have been theorists or\\nphilosophers before they were politicians, or who, having been students\\nof history, have allowed some great historical parallel, such as the\\nenglish revolution of 1688, or possibly athenian democracy or roman\\nimperialism, to be the medium through which they viewed contemporary\\nevents. or perhaps the long projecting shadow of some existing\\ninstitution may have darkened their vision. the church of the future,\\nthe commonwealth of the future, the society of the future, have so\\nabsorbed their minds, that they are unable to see in their true\\nproportions the politics of to-day. they have been intoxicated with\\ngreat ideas, such as liberty, or equality, or the greatest happiness of\\nthe greatest number, or the brotherhood of humanity, and they no longer\\ncare to consider how these ideas must be limited in practice or\\nharmonized with the conditions of human life. they are full of light,\\nbut the light to them has become only a sort of luminous mist or\\nblindness. almost every one has known some enthusiastic half-educated\\nperson, who sees everything at false distances, and in erroneous\\nproportions.\\n\\nwith this disorder of eyesight may be contrasted another—of those who\\nsee not far into the distance, but what is near only; who have been\\nengaged all their lives in a trade or a profession; who are limited to\\na set or sect of their own. men of this kind have no universal except\\ntheir own interests or the interests of their class, no principle but\\nthe opinion of persons like themselves, no knowledge of affairs beyond\\nwhat they pick up in the streets or at their club. suppose them to be\\nsent into a larger world, to undertake some higher calling, from being\\ntradesmen to turn generals or politicians, from being schoolmasters to\\nbecome philosophers:—or imagine them on a sudden to receive an inward\\nlight which reveals to them for the first time in their lives a higher\\nidea of god and the existence of a spiritual world, by this sudden\\nconversion or change is not their daily life likely to be upset; and on\\nthe other hand will not many of their old prejudices and narrownesses\\nstill adhere to them long after they have begun to take a more\\ncomprehensive view of human things? from familiar examples like these\\nwe may learn what plato meant by the eyesight which is liable to two\\nkinds of disorders.\\n\\nnor have we any difficulty in drawing a parallel between the young\\nathenian in the fifth century before christ who became unsettled by new\\nideas, and the student of a modern university who has been the subject\\nof a similar ‘aufklärung.’ we too observe that when young men begin to\\ncriticise customary beliefs, or to analyse the constitution of human\\nnature, they are apt to lose hold of solid principle (ἅπαν τὸ βέβαιον\\nαὐτῶν ἐξοίχεται). they are like trees which have been frequently\\ntransplanted. the earth about them is loose, and they have no roots\\nreaching far into the soil. they ‘light upon every flower,’ following\\ntheir own wayward wills, or because the wind blows them. they catch\\nopinions, as diseases are caught—when they are in the air. borne hither\\nand thither, ‘they speedily fall into beliefs’ the opposite of those in\\nwhich they were brought up. they hardly retain the distinction of right\\nand wrong; they seem to think one thing as good as another. they\\nsuppose themselves to be searching after truth when they are playing\\nthe game of ‘follow my leader.’ they fall in love ‘at first sight’ with\\nparadoxes respecting morality, some fancy about art, some novelty or\\neccentricity in religion, and like lovers they are so absorbed for a\\ntime in their new notion that they can think of nothing else. the\\nresolution of some philosophical or theological question seems to them\\nmore interesting and important than any substantial knowledge of\\nliterature or science or even than a good life. like the youth in the\\nphilebus, they are ready to discourse to any one about a new\\nphilosophy. they are generally the disciples of some eminent professor\\nor sophist, whom they rather imitate than understand. they may be\\ncounted happy if in later years they retain some of the simple truths\\nwhich they acquired in early education, and which they may, perhaps,\\nfind to be worth all the rest. such is the picture which plato draws\\nand which we only reproduce, partly in his own words, of the dangers\\nwhich beset youth in times of transition, when old opinions are fading\\naway and the new are not yet firmly established. their condition is\\ningeniously compared by him to that of a supposititious son, who has\\nmade the discovery that his reputed parents are not his real ones, and,\\nin consequence, they have lost their authority over him.\\n\\nthe distinction between the mathematician and the dialectician is also\\nnoticeable. plato is very well aware that the faculty of the\\nmathematician is quite distinct from the higher philosophical sense\\nwhich recognizes and combines first principles. the contempt which he\\nexpresses for distinctions of words, the danger of involuntary\\nfalsehood, the apology which socrates makes for his earnestness of\\nspeech, are highly characteristic of the platonic style and mode of\\nthought. the quaint notion that if palamedes was the inventor of number\\nagamemnon could not have counted his feet; the art by which we are made\\nto believe that this state of ours is not a dream only; the gravity\\nwith which the first step is taken in the actual creation of the state,\\nnamely, the sending out of the city all who had arrived at ten years of\\nage, in order to expedite the business of education by a generation,\\nare also truly platonic. (for the last, compare the passage at the end\\nof the third book, in which he expects the lie about the earthborn men\\nto be believed in the second generation.)\\n\\nbook viii. and so we have arrived at the conclusion, that in the\\nperfect state wives and children are to be in common; and the education\\nand pursuits of men and women, both in war and peace, are to be common,\\nand kings are to be philosophers and warriors, and the soldiers of the\\nstate are to live together, having all things in common; and they are\\nto be warrior athletes, receiving no pay but only their food, from the\\nother citizens. now let us return to the point at which we digressed.\\n‘that is easily done,’ he replied: ‘you were speaking of the state\\nwhich you had constructed, and of the individual who answered to this,\\nboth of whom you affirmed to be good; and you said that of inferior\\nstates there were four forms and four individuals corresponding to\\nthem, which although deficient in various degrees, were all of them\\nworth inspecting with a view to determining the relative happiness or\\nmisery of the best or worst man. then polemarchus and adeimantus\\ninterrupted you, and this led to another argument,—and so here we are.’\\nsuppose that we put ourselves again in the same position, and do you\\nrepeat your question. ‘i should like to know of what constitutions you\\nwere speaking?’ besides the perfect state there are only four of any\\nnote in hellas:—first, the famous lacedaemonian or cretan commonwealth;\\nsecondly, oligarchy, a state full of evils; thirdly, democracy, which\\nfollows next in order; fourthly, tyranny, which is the disease or death\\nof all government. now, states are not made of ‘oak and rock,’ but of\\nflesh and blood; and therefore as there are five states there must be\\nfive human natures in individuals, which correspond to them. and first,\\nthere is the ambitious nature, which answers to the lacedaemonian\\nstate; secondly, the oligarchical nature; thirdly, the democratical;\\nand fourthly, the tyrannical. this last will have to be compared with\\nthe perfectly just, which is the fifth, that we may know which is the\\nhappier, and then we shall be able to determine whether the argument of\\nthrasymachus or our own is the more convincing. and as before we began\\nwith the state and went on to the individual, so now, beginning with\\ntimocracy, let us go on to the timocratical man, and then proceed to\\nthe other forms of government, and the individuals who answer to them.\\n\\nbut how did timocracy arise out of the perfect state? plainly, like all\\nchanges of government, from division in the rulers. but whence came\\ndivision? ‘sing, heavenly muses,’ as homer says;—let them condescend to\\nanswer us, as if we were children, to whom they put on a solemn face in\\njest. ‘and what will they say?’ they will say that human things are\\nfated to decay, and even the perfect state will not escape from this\\nlaw of destiny, when ‘the wheel comes full circle’ in a period short or\\nlong. plants or animals have times of fertility and sterility, which\\nthe intelligence of rulers because alloyed by sense will not enable\\nthem to ascertain, and children will be born out of season. for whereas\\ndivine creations are in a perfect cycle or number, the human creation\\nis in a number which declines from perfection, and has four terms and\\nthree intervals of numbers, increasing, waning, assimilating,\\ndissimilating, and yet perfectly commensurate with each other. the base\\nof the number with a fourth added (or which is 3:4), multiplied by five\\nand cubed, gives two harmonies:—the first a square number, which is a\\nhundred times the base (or a hundred times a hundred); the second, an\\noblong, being a hundred squares of the rational diameter of a figure\\nthe side of which is five, subtracting one from each square or two\\nperfect squares from all, and adding a hundred cubes of three. this\\nentire number is geometrical and contains the rule or law of\\ngeneration. when this law is neglected marriages will be unpropitious;\\nthe inferior offspring who are then born will in time become the\\nrulers; the state will decline, and education fall into decay;\\ngymnastic will be preferred to music, and the gold and silver and brass\\nand iron will form a chaotic mass—thus division will arise. such is the\\nmuses’ answer to our question. ‘and a true answer, of course:—but what\\nmore have they to say?’ they say that the two races, the iron and\\nbrass, and the silver and gold, will draw the state different ways;—the\\none will take to trade and moneymaking, and the others, having the true\\nriches and not caring for money, will resist them: the contest will end\\nin a compromise; they will agree to have private property, and will\\nenslave their fellow-citizens who were once their friends and\\nnurturers. but they will retain their warlike character, and will be\\nchiefly occupied in fighting and exercising rule. thus arises\\ntimocracy, which is intermediate between aristocracy and oligarchy.\\n\\nthe new form of government resembles the ideal in obedience to rulers\\nand contempt for trade, and having common meals, and in devotion to\\nwarlike and gymnastic exercises. but corruption has crept into\\nphilosophy, and simplicity of character, which was once her note, is\\nnow looked for only in the military class. arts of war begin to prevail\\nover arts of peace; the ruler is no longer a philosopher; as in\\noligarchies, there springs up among them an extravagant love of\\ngain—get another man’s and save your own, is their principle; and they\\nhave dark places in which they hoard their gold and silver, for the use\\nof their women and others; they take their pleasures by stealth, like\\nboys who are running away from their father—the law; and their\\neducation is not inspired by the muse, but imposed by the strong arm of\\npower. the leading characteristic of this state is party spirit and\\nambition.\\n\\nand what manner of man answers to such a state? ‘in love of\\ncontention,’ replied adeimantus, ‘he will be like our friend glaucon.’\\nin that respect, perhaps, but not in others. he is self-asserting and\\nill-educated, yet fond of literature, although not himself a\\nspeaker,—fierce with slaves, but obedient to rulers, a lover of power\\nand honour, which he hopes to gain by deeds of arms,—fond, too, of\\ngymnastics and of hunting. as he advances in years he grows avaricious,\\nfor he has lost philosophy, which is the only saviour and guardian of\\nmen. his origin is as follows:—his father is a good man dwelling in an\\nill-ordered state, who has retired from politics in order that he may\\nlead a quiet life. his mother is angry at her loss of precedence among\\nother women; she is disgusted at her husband’s selfishness, and she\\nexpatiates to her son on the unmanliness and indolence of his father.\\nthe old family servant takes up the tale, and says to the youth:—‘when\\nyou grow up you must be more of a man than your father.’ all the world\\nare agreed that he who minds his own business is an idiot, while a\\nbusybody is highly honoured and esteemed. the young man compares this\\nspirit with his father’s words and ways, and as he is naturally well\\ndisposed, although he has suffered from evil influences, he rests at a\\nmiddle point and becomes ambitious and a lover of honour.\\n\\nand now let us set another city over against another man. the next form\\nof government is oligarchy, in which the rule is of the rich only; nor\\nis it difficult to see how such a state arises. the decline begins with\\nthe possession of gold and silver; illegal modes of expenditure are\\ninvented; one draws another on, and the multitude are infected; riches\\noutweigh virtue; lovers of money take the place of lovers of honour;\\nmisers of politicians; and, in time, political privileges are confined\\nby law to the rich, who do not shrink from violence in order to effect\\ntheir purposes.\\n\\nthus much of the origin,—let us next consider the evils of oligarchy.\\nwould a man who wanted to be safe on a voyage take a bad pilot because\\nhe was rich, or refuse a good one because he was poor? and does not the\\nanalogy apply still more to the state? and there are yet greater evils:\\ntwo nations are struggling together in one—the rich and the poor; and\\nthe rich dare not put arms into the hands of the poor, and are\\nunwilling to pay for defenders out of their own money. and have we not\\nalready condemned that state in which the same persons are warriors as\\nwell as shopkeepers? the greatest evil of all is that a man may sell\\nhis property and have no place in the state; while there is one class\\nwhich has enormous wealth, the other is entirely destitute. but observe\\nthat these destitutes had not really any more of the governing nature\\nin them when they were rich than now that they are poor; they were\\nmiserable spendthrifts always. they are the drones of the hive; only\\nwhereas the actual drone is unprovided by nature with a sting, the\\ntwo-legged things whom we call drones are some of them without stings\\nand some of them have dreadful stings; in other words, there are\\npaupers and there are rogues. these are never far apart; and in\\noligarchical cities, where nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a\\nruler, you will find abundance of both. and this evil state of society\\noriginates in bad education and bad government.\\n\\nlike state, like man,—the change in the latter begins with the\\nrepresentative of timocracy; he walks at first in the ways of his\\nfather, who may have been a statesman, or general, perhaps; and\\npresently he sees him ‘fallen from his high estate,’ the victim of\\ninformers, dying in prison or exile, or by the hand of the executioner.\\nthe lesson which he thus receives, makes him cautious; he leaves\\npolitics, represses his pride, and saves pence. avarice is enthroned as\\nhis bosom’s lord, and assumes the style of the great king; the rational\\nand spirited elements sit humbly on the ground at either side, the one\\nimmersed in calculation, the other absorbed in the admiration of\\nwealth. the love of honour turns to love of money; the conversion is\\ninstantaneous. the man is mean, saving, toiling, the slave of one\\npassion which is the master of the rest: is he not the very image of\\nthe state? he has had no education, or he would never have allowed the\\nblind god of riches to lead the dance within him. and being uneducated\\nhe will have many slavish desires, some beggarly, some knavish,\\nbreeding in his soul. if he is the trustee of an orphan, and has the\\npower to defraud, he will soon prove that he is not without the will,\\nand that his passions are only restrained by fear and not by reason.\\nhence he leads a divided existence; in which the better desires mostly\\nprevail. but when he is contending for prizes and other distinctions,\\nhe is afraid to incur a loss which is to be repaid only by barren\\nhonour; in time of war he fights with a small part of his resources,\\nand usually keeps his money and loses the victory.\\n\\nnext comes democracy and the democratic man, out of oligarchy and the\\noligarchical man. insatiable avarice is the ruling passion of an\\noligarchy; and they encourage expensive habits in order that they may\\ngain by the ruin of extravagant youth. thus men of family often lose\\ntheir property or rights of citizenship; but they remain in the city,\\nfull of hatred against the new owners of their estates and ripe for\\nrevolution. the usurer with stooping walk pretends not to see them; he\\npasses by, and leaves his sting—that is, his money—in some other\\nvictim; and many a man has to pay the parent or principal sum\\nmultiplied into a family of children, and is reduced into a state of\\ndronage by him. the only way of diminishing the evil is either to limit\\na man in his use of his property, or to insist that he shall lend at\\nhis own risk. but the ruling class do not want remedies; they care only\\nfor money, and are as careless of virtue as the poorest of the\\ncitizens. now there are occasions on which the governors and the\\ngoverned meet together,—at festivals, on a journey, voyaging or\\nfighting. the sturdy pauper finds that in the hour of danger he is not\\ndespised; he sees the rich man puffing and panting, and draws the\\nconclusion which he privately imparts to his companions,—‘that our\\npeople are not good for much;’ and as a sickly frame is made ill by a\\nmere touch from without, or sometimes without external impulse is ready\\nto fall to pieces of itself, so from the least cause, or with none at\\nall, the city falls ill and fights a battle for life or death. and\\ndemocracy comes into power when the poor are the victors, killing some\\nand exiling some, and giving equal shares in the government to all the\\nrest.\\n\\nthe manner of life in such a state is that of democrats; there is\\nfreedom and plainness of speech, and every man does what is right in\\nhis own eyes, and has his own way of life. hence arise the most various\\ndevelopments of character; the state is like a piece of embroidery of\\nwhich the colours and figures are the manners of men, and there are\\nmany who, like women and children, prefer this variety to real beauty\\nand excellence. the state is not one but many, like a bazaar at which\\nyou can buy anything. the great charm is, that you may do as you like;\\nyou may govern if you like, let it alone if you like; go to war and\\nmake peace if you feel disposed, and all quite irrespective of anybody\\nelse. when you condemn men to death they remain alive all the same; a\\ngentleman is desired to go into exile, and he stalks about the streets\\nlike a hero; and nobody sees him or cares for him. observe, too, how\\ngrandly democracy sets her foot upon all our fine theories of\\neducation,—how little she cares for the training of her statesmen! the\\nonly qualification which she demands is the profession of patriotism.\\nsuch is democracy;—a pleasing, lawless, various sort of government,\\ndistributing equality to equals and unequals alike.\\n\\nlet us now inspect the individual democrat; and first, as in the case\\nof the state, we will trace his antecedents. he is the son of a miserly\\noligarch, and has been taught by him to restrain the love of\\nunnecessary pleasures. perhaps i ought to explain this latter\\nterm:—necessary pleasures are those which are good, and which we cannot\\ndo without; unnecessary pleasures are those which do no good, and of\\nwhich the desire might be eradicated by early training. for example,\\nthe pleasures of eating and drinking are necessary and healthy, up to a\\ncertain point; beyond that point they are alike hurtful to body and\\nmind, and the excess may be avoided. when in excess, they may be\\nrightly called expensive pleasures, in opposition to the useful ones.\\nand the drone, as we called him, is the slave of these unnecessary\\npleasures and desires, whereas the miserly oligarch is subject only to\\nthe necessary.\\n\\nthe oligarch changes into the democrat in the following manner:—the\\nyouth who has had a miserly bringing up, gets a taste of the drone’s\\nhoney; he meets with wild companions, who introduce him to every new\\npleasure. as in the state, so in the individual, there are allies on\\nboth sides, temptations from without and passions from within; there is\\nreason also and external influences of parents and friends in alliance\\nwith the oligarchical principle; and the two factions are in violent\\nconflict with one another. sometimes the party of order prevails, but\\nthen again new desires and new disorders arise, and the whole mob of\\npassions gets possession of the acropolis, that is to say, the soul,\\nwhich they find void and unguarded by true words and works. falsehoods\\nand illusions ascend to take their place; the prodigal goes back into\\nthe country of the lotophagi or drones, and openly dwells there. and if\\nany offer of alliance or parley of individual elders comes from home,\\nthe false spirits shut the gates of the castle and permit no one to\\nenter,—there is a battle, and they gain the victory; and straightway\\nmaking alliance with the desires, they banish modesty, which they call\\nfolly, and send temperance over the border. when the house has been\\nswept and garnished, they dress up the exiled vices, and, crowning them\\nwith garlands, bring them back under new names. insolence they call\\ngood breeding, anarchy freedom, waste magnificence, impudence courage.\\nsuch is the process by which the youth passes from the necessary\\npleasures to the unnecessary. after a while he divides his time\\nimpartially between them; and perhaps, when he gets older and the\\nviolence of passion has abated, he restores some of the exiles and\\nlives in a sort of equilibrium, indulging first one pleasure and then\\nanother; and if reason comes and tells him that some pleasures are good\\nand honourable, and others bad and vile, he shakes his head and says\\nthat he can make no distinction between them. thus he lives in the\\nfancy of the hour; sometimes he takes to drink, and then he turns\\nabstainer; he practises in the gymnasium or he does nothing at all;\\nthen again he would be a philosopher or a politician; or again, he\\nwould be a warrior or a man of business; he is\\n\\n‘every thing by starts and nothing long.’\\n\\n\\nthere remains still the finest and fairest of all men and all\\nstates—tyranny and the tyrant. tyranny springs from democracy much as\\ndemocracy springs from oligarchy. both arise from excess; the one from\\nexcess of wealth, the other from excess of freedom. ‘the great natural\\ngood of life,’ says the democrat, ‘is freedom.’ and this exclusive love\\nof freedom and regardlessness of everything else, is the cause of the\\nchange from democracy to tyranny. the state demands the strong wine of\\nfreedom, and unless her rulers give her a plentiful draught, punishes\\nand insults them; equality and fraternity of governors and governed is\\nthe approved principle. anarchy is the law, not of the state only, but\\nof private houses, and extends even to the animals. father and son,\\ncitizen and foreigner, teacher and pupil, old and young, are all on a\\nlevel; fathers and teachers fear their sons and pupils, and the wisdom\\nof the young man is a match for the elder, and the old imitate the\\njaunty manners of the young because they are afraid of being thought\\nmorose. slaves are on a level with their masters and mistresses, and\\nthere is no difference between men and women. nay, the very animals in\\na democratic state have a freedom which is unknown in other places. the\\nshe-dogs are as good as their she-mistresses, and horses and asses\\nmarch along with dignity and run their noses against anybody who comes\\nin their way. ‘that has often been my experience.’ at last the citizens\\nbecome so sensitive that they cannot endure the yoke of laws, written\\nor unwritten; they would have no man call himself their master. such is\\nthe glorious beginning of things out of which tyranny springs.\\n‘glorious, indeed; but what is to follow?’ the ruin of oligarchy is the\\nruin of democracy; for there is a law of contraries; the excess of\\nfreedom passes into the excess of slavery, and the greater the freedom\\nthe greater the slavery. you will remember that in the oligarchy were\\nfound two classes—rogues and paupers, whom we compared to drones with\\nand without stings. these two classes are to the state what phlegm and\\nbile are to the human body; and the state-physician, or legislator,\\nmust get rid of them, just as the bee-master keeps the drones out of\\nthe hive. now in a democracy, too, there are drones, but they are more\\nnumerous and more dangerous than in the oligarchy; there they are inert\\nand unpractised, here they are full of life and animation; and the\\nkeener sort speak and act, while the others buzz about the bema and\\nprevent their opponents from being heard. and there is another class in\\ndemocratic states, of respectable, thriving individuals, who can be\\nsqueezed when the drones have need of their possessions; there is\\nmoreover a third class, who are the labourers and the artisans, and\\nthey make up the mass of the people. when the people meet, they are\\nomnipotent, but they cannot be brought together unless they are\\nattracted by a little honey; and the rich are made to supply the honey,\\nof which the demagogues keep the greater part themselves, giving a\\ntaste only to the mob. their victims attempt to resist; they are driven\\nmad by the stings of the drones, and so become downright oligarchs in\\nself-defence. then follow informations and convictions for treason. the\\npeople have some protector whom they nurse into greatness, and from\\nthis root the tree of tyranny springs. the nature of the change is\\nindicated in the old fable of the temple of zeus lycaeus, which tells\\nhow he who tastes human flesh mixed up with the flesh of other victims\\nwill turn into a wolf. even so the protector, who tastes human blood,\\nand slays some and exiles others with or without law, who hints at\\nabolition of debts and division of lands, must either perish or become\\na wolf—that is, a tyrant. perhaps he is driven out, but he soon comes\\nback from exile; and then if his enemies cannot get rid of him by\\nlawful means, they plot his assassination. thereupon the friend of the\\npeople makes his well-known request to them for a body-guard, which\\nthey readily grant, thinking only of his danger and not of their own.\\nnow let the rich man make to himself wings, for he will never run away\\nagain if he does not do so then. and the great protector, having\\ncrushed all his rivals, stands proudly erect in the chariot of state, a\\nfull-blown tyrant: let us enquire into the nature of his happiness.\\n\\nin the early days of his tyranny he smiles and beams upon everybody; he\\nis not a ‘dominus,’ no, not he: he has only come to put an end to debt\\nand the monopoly of land. having got rid of foreign enemies, he makes\\nhimself necessary to the state by always going to war. he is thus\\nenabled to depress the poor by heavy taxes, and so keep them at work;\\nand he can get rid of bolder spirits by handing them over to the enemy.\\nthen comes unpopularity; some of his old associates have the courage to\\noppose him. the consequence is, that he has to make a purgation of the\\nstate; but, unlike the physician who purges away the bad, he must get\\nrid of the high-spirited, the wise and the wealthy; for he has no\\nchoice between death and a life of shame and dishonour. and the more\\nhated he is, the more he will require trusty guards; but how will he\\nobtain them? ‘they will come flocking like birds—for pay.’ will he not\\nrather obtain them on the spot? he will take the slaves from their\\nowners and make them his body-guard; these are his trusted friends, who\\nadmire and look up to him. are not the tragic poets wise who magnify\\nand exalt the tyrant, and say that he is wise by association with the\\nwise? and are not their praises of tyranny alone a sufficient reason\\nwhy we should exclude them from our state? they may go to other cities,\\nand gather the mob about them with fine words, and change commonwealths\\ninto tyrannies and democracies, receiving honours and rewards for their\\nservices; but the higher they and their friends ascend constitution\\nhill, the more their honour will fail and become ‘too asthmatic to\\nmount.’ to return to the tyrant—how will he support that rare army of\\nhis? first, by robbing the temples of their treasures, which will\\nenable him to lighten the taxes; then he will take all his father’s\\nproperty, and spend it on his companions, male or female. now his\\nfather is the demus, and if the demus gets angry, and says that a great\\nhulking son ought not to be a burden on his parents, and bids him and\\nhis riotous crew begone, then will the parent know what a monster he\\nhas been nurturing, and that the son whom he would fain expel is too\\nstrong for him. ‘you do not mean to say that he will beat his father?’\\nyes, he will, after having taken away his arms. ‘then he is a parricide\\nand a cruel, unnatural son.’ and the people have jumped from the fear\\nof slavery into slavery, out of the smoke into the fire. thus liberty,\\nwhen out of all order and reason, passes into the worst form of\\nservitude...\\n\\nin the previous books plato has described the ideal state; now he\\nreturns to the perverted or declining forms, on which he had lightly\\ntouched at the end of book iv. these he describes in a succession of\\nparallels between the individuals and the states, tracing the origin of\\neither in the state or individual which has preceded them. he begins by\\nasking the point at which he digressed; and is thus led shortly to\\nrecapitulate the substance of the three former books, which also\\ncontain a parallel of the philosopher and the state.\\n\\nof the first decline he gives no intelligible account; he would not\\nhave liked to admit the most probable causes of the fall of his ideal\\nstate, which to us would appear to be the impracticability of communism\\nor the natural antagonism of the ruling and subject classes. he throws\\na veil of mystery over the origin of the decline, which he attributes\\nto ignorance of the law of population. of this law the famous\\ngeometrical figure or number is the expression. like the ancients in\\ngeneral, he had no idea of the gradual perfectibility of man or of the\\neducation of the human race. his ideal was not to be attained in the\\ncourse of ages, but was to spring in full armour from the head of the\\nlegislator. when good laws had been given, he thought only of the\\nmanner in which they were likely to be corrupted, or of how they might\\nbe filled up in detail or restored in accordance with their original\\nspirit. he appears not to have reflected upon the full meaning of his\\nown words, ‘in the brief space of human life, nothing great can be\\naccomplished’; or again, as he afterwards says in the laws, ‘infinite\\ntime is the maker of cities.’ the order of constitutions which is\\nadopted by him represents an order of thought rather than a succession\\nof time, and may be considered as the first attempt to frame a\\nphilosophy of history.\\n\\nthe first of these declining states is timocracy, or the government of\\nsoldiers and lovers of honour, which answers to the spartan state; this\\nis a government of force, in which education is not inspired by the\\nmuses, but imposed by the law, and in which all the finer elements of\\norganization have disappeared. the philosopher himself has lost the\\nlove of truth, and the soldier, who is of a simpler and honester\\nnature, rules in his stead. the individual who answers to timocracy has\\nsome noticeable qualities. he is described as ill educated, but, like\\nthe spartan, a lover of literature; and although he is a harsh master\\nto his servants he has no natural superiority over them. his character\\nis based upon a reaction against the circumstances of his father, who\\nin a troubled city has retired from politics; and his mother, who is\\ndissatisfied at her own position, is always urging him towards the life\\nof political ambition. such a character may have had this origin, and\\nindeed livy attributes the licinian laws to a feminine jealousy of a\\nsimilar kind. but there is obviously no connection between the manner\\nin which the timocratic state springs out of the ideal, and the mere\\naccident by which the timocratic man is the son of a retired statesman.\\n\\nthe two next stages in the decline of constitutions have even less\\nhistorical foundation. for there is no trace in greek history of a\\npolity like the spartan or cretan passing into an oligarchy of wealth,\\nor of the oligarchy of wealth passing into a democracy. the order of\\nhistory appears to be different; first, in the homeric times there is\\nthe royal or patriarchal form of government, which a century or two\\nlater was succeeded by an oligarchy of birth rather than of wealth, and\\nin which wealth was only the accident of the hereditary possession of\\nland and power. sometimes this oligarchical government gave way to a\\ngovernment based upon a qualification of property, which, according to\\naristotle’s mode of using words, would have been called a timocracy;\\nand this in some cities, as at athens, became the conducting medium to\\ndemocracy. but such was not the necessary order of succession in\\nstates; nor, indeed, can any order be discerned in the endless\\nfluctuation of greek history (like the tides in the euripus), except,\\nperhaps, in the almost uniform tendency from monarchy to aristocracy in\\nthe earliest times. at first sight there appears to be a similar\\ninversion in the last step of the platonic succession; for tyranny,\\ninstead of being the natural end of democracy, in early greek history\\nappears rather as a stage leading to democracy; the reign of\\npeisistratus and his sons is an episode which comes between the\\nlegislation of solon and the constitution of cleisthenes; and some\\nsecret cause common to them all seems to have led the greater part of\\nhellas at her first appearance in the dawn of history, e.g. athens,\\nargos, corinth, sicyon, and nearly every state with the exception of\\nsparta, through a similar stage of tyranny which ended either in\\noligarchy or democracy. but then we must remember that plato is\\ndescribing rather the contemporary governments of the sicilian states,\\nwhich alternated between democracy and tyranny, than the ancient\\nhistory of athens or corinth.\\n\\nthe portrait of the tyrant himself is just such as the later greek\\ndelighted to draw of phalaris and dionysius, in which, as in the lives\\nof mediaeval saints or mythic heroes, the conduct and actions of one\\nwere attributed to another in order to fill up the outline. there was\\nno enormity which the greek was not today to believe of them; the\\ntyrant was the negation of government and law; his assassination was\\nglorious; there was no crime, however unnatural, which might not with\\nprobability be attributed to him. in this, plato was only following the\\ncommon thought of his countrymen, which he embellished and exaggerated\\nwith all the power of his genius. there is no need to suppose that he\\ndrew from life; or that his knowledge of tyrants is derived from a\\npersonal acquaintance with dionysius. the manner in which he speaks of\\nthem would rather tend to render doubtful his ever having ‘consorted’\\nwith them, or entertained the schemes, which are attributed to him in\\nthe epistles, of regenerating sicily by their help.\\n\\nplato in a hyperbolical and serio-comic vein exaggerates the follies of\\ndemocracy which he also sees reflected in social life. to him democracy\\nis a state of individualism or dissolution; in which every one is doing\\nwhat is right in his own eyes. of a people animated by a common spirit\\nof liberty, rising as one man to repel the persian host, which is the\\nleading idea of democracy in herodotus and thucydides, he never seems\\nto think. but if he is not a believer in liberty, still less is he a\\nlover of tyranny. his deeper and more serious condemnation is reserved\\nfor the tyrant, who is the ideal of wickedness and also of weakness,\\nand who in his utter helplessness and suspiciousness is leading an\\nalmost impossible existence, without that remnant of good which, in\\nplato’s opinion, was required to give power to evil (book i). this\\nideal of wickedness living in helpless misery, is the reverse of that\\nother portrait of perfect injustice ruling in happiness and splendour,\\nwhich first of all thrasymachus, and afterwards the sons of ariston had\\ndrawn, and is also the reverse of the king whose rule of life is the\\ngood of his subjects.\\n\\neach of these governments and individuals has a corresponding ethical\\ngradation: the ideal state is under the rule of reason, not\\nextinguishing but harmonizing the passions, and training them in\\nvirtue; in the timocracy and the timocratic man the constitution,\\nwhether of the state or of the individual, is based, first, upon\\ncourage, and secondly, upon the love of honour; this latter virtue,\\nwhich is hardly to be esteemed a virtue, has superseded all the rest.\\nin the second stage of decline the virtues have altogether disappeared,\\nand the love of gain has succeeded to them; in the third stage, or\\ndemocracy, the various passions are allowed to have free play, and the\\nvirtues and vices are impartially cultivated. but this freedom, which\\nleads to many curious extravagances of character, is in reality only a\\nstate of weakness and dissipation. at last, one monster passion takes\\npossession of the whole nature of man—this is tyranny. in all of them\\nexcess—the excess first of wealth and then of freedom, is the element\\nof decay.\\n\\nthe eighth book of the republic abounds in pictures of life and\\nfanciful allusions; the use of metaphorical language is carried to a\\ngreater extent than anywhere else in plato. we may remark,\\n\\n(1), the description of the two nations in one, which become more and\\nmore divided in the greek republics, as in feudal times, and perhaps\\nalso in our own;\\n\\n(2), the notion of democracy expressed in a sort of pythagorean formula\\nas equality among unequals;\\n\\n(3), the free and easy ways of men and animals, which are\\ncharacteristic of liberty, as foreign mercenaries and universal\\nmistrust are of the tyrant;\\n\\n(4), the proposal that mere debts should not be recoverable by law is a\\nspeculation which has often been entertained by reformers of the law in\\nmodern times, and is in harmony with the tendencies of modern\\nlegislation. debt and land were the two great difficulties of the\\nancient lawgiver: in modern times we may be said to have almost, if not\\nquite, solved the first of these difficulties, but hardly the second.\\n\\nstill more remarkable are the corresponding portraits of individuals:\\nthere is the family picture of the father and mother and the old\\nservant of the timocratical man, and the outward respectability and\\ninherent meanness of the oligarchical; the uncontrolled licence and\\nfreedom of the democrat, in which the young alcibiades seems to be\\ndepicted, doing right or wrong as he pleases, and who at last, like the\\nprodigal, goes into a far country (note here the play of language by\\nwhich the democratic man is himself represented under the image of a\\nstate having a citadel and receiving embassies); and there is the\\nwild-beast nature, which breaks loose in his successor. the hit about\\nthe tyrant being a parricide; the representation of the tyrant’s life\\nas an obscene dream; the rhetorical surprise of a more miserable than\\nthe most miserable of men in book ix; the hint to the poets that if\\nthey are the friends of tyrants there is no place for them in a\\nconstitutional state, and that they are too clever not to see the\\npropriety of their own expulsion; the continuous image of the drones\\nwho are of two kinds, swelling at last into the monster drone having\\nwings (book ix),—are among plato’s happiest touches.\\n\\nthere remains to be considered the great difficulty of this book of the\\nrepublic, the so-called number of the state. this is a puzzle almost as\\ngreat as the number of the beast in the book of revelation, and though\\napparently known to aristotle, is referred to by cicero as a proverb of\\nobscurity (ep. ad att.). and some have imagined that there is no answer\\nto the puzzle, and that plato has been practising upon his readers. but\\nsuch a deception as this is inconsistent with the manner in which\\naristotle speaks of the number (pol.), and would have been ridiculous\\nto any reader of the republic who was acquainted with greek\\nmathematics. as little reason is there for supposing that plato\\nintentionally used obscure expressions; the obscurity arises from our\\nwant of familiarity with the subject. on the other hand, plato himself\\nindicates that he is not altogether serious, and in describing his\\nnumber as a solemn jest of the muses, he appears to imply some degree\\nof satire on the symbolical use of number. (compare cratylus; protag.)\\n\\nour hope of understanding the passage depends principally on an\\naccurate study of the words themselves; on which a faint light is\\nthrown by the parallel passage in the ninth book. another help is the\\nallusion in aristotle, who makes the important remark that the latter\\npart of the passage (greek) describes a solid figure. (pol.—‘he only\\nsays that nothing is abiding, but that all things change in a certain\\ncycle; and that the origin of the change is a base of numbers which are\\nin the ratio of 4:3; and this when combined with a figure of five gives\\ntwo harmonies; he means when the number of this figure becomes solid.’)\\nsome further clue may be gathered from the appearance of the\\npythagorean triangle, which is denoted by the numbers 3, 4, 5, and in\\nwhich, as in every right-angled triangle, the squares of the two lesser\\nsides equal the square of the hypotenuse (9 + 16 = 25).\\n\\nplato begins by speaking of a perfect or cyclical number (tim.), i.e. a\\nnumber in which the sum of the divisors equals the whole; this is the\\ndivine or perfect number in which all lesser cycles or revolutions are\\ncomplete. he also speaks of a human or imperfect number, having four\\nterms and three intervals of numbers which are related to one another\\nin certain proportions; these he converts into figures, and finds in\\nthem when they have been raised to the third power certain elements of\\nnumber, which give two ‘harmonies,’ the one square, the other oblong;\\nbut he does not say that the square number answers to the divine, or\\nthe oblong number to the human cycle; nor is any intimation given that\\nthe first or divine number represents the period of the world, the\\nsecond the period of the state, or of the human race as zeller\\nsupposes; nor is the divine number afterwards mentioned (arist.). the\\nsecond is the number of generations or births, and presides over them\\nin the same mysterious manner in which the stars preside over them, or\\nin which, according to the pythagoreans, opportunity, justice,\\nmarriage, are represented by some number or figure. this is probably\\nthe number 216.\\n\\nthe explanation given in the text supposes the two harmonies to make up\\nthe number 8000. this explanation derives a certain plausibility from\\nthe circumstance that 8000 is the ancient number of the spartan\\ncitizens (herod.), and would be what plato might have called ‘a number\\nwhich nearly concerns the population of a city’; the mysterious\\ndisappearance of the spartan population may possibly have suggested to\\nhim the first cause of his decline of states. the lesser or square\\n‘harmony,’ of 400, might be a symbol of the guardians,—the larger or\\noblong ‘harmony,’ of the people, and the numbers 3, 4, 5 might refer\\nrespectively to the three orders in the state or parts of the soul, the\\nfour virtues, the five forms of government. the harmony of the musical\\nscale, which is elsewhere used as a symbol of the harmony of the state,\\nis also indicated. for the numbers 3, 4, 5, which represent the sides\\nof the pythagorean triangle, also denote the intervals of the scale.\\n\\nthe terms used in the statement of the problem may be explained as\\nfollows. a perfect number (greek), as already stated, is one which is\\nequal to the sum of its divisors. thus 6, which is the first perfect or\\ncyclical number, = 1 + 2 + 3. the words (greek), ‘terms’ or ‘notes,’\\nand (greek), ‘intervals,’ are applicable to music as well as to number\\nand figure. (greek) is the ‘base’ on which the whole calculation\\ndepends, or the ‘lowest term’ from which it can be worked out. the\\nwords (greek) have been variously translated—‘squared and cubed’\\n(donaldson), ‘equalling and equalled in power’ (weber), ‘by involution\\nand evolution,’ i.e. by raising the power and extracting the root (as\\nin the translation). numbers are called ‘like and unlike’ (greek) when\\nthe factors or the sides of the planes and cubes which they represent\\nare or are not in the same ratio: e.g. 8 and 27 = 2 cubed and 3 cubed;\\nand conversely. ‘waxing’ (greek) numbers, called also ‘increasing’\\n(greek), are those which are exceeded by the sum of their divisors:\\ne.g. 12 and 18 are less than 16 and 21. ‘waning’ (greek) numbers,\\ncalled also ‘decreasing’ (greek) are those which succeed the sum of\\ntheir divisors: e.g. 8 and 27 exceed 7 and 13. the words translated\\n‘commensurable and agreeable to one another’ (greek) seem to be\\ndifferent ways of describing the same relation, with more or less\\nprecision. they are equivalent to ‘expressible in terms having the same\\nrelation to one another,’ like the series 8, 12, 18, 27, each of which\\nnumbers is in the relation of (1 and 1/2) to the preceding. the ‘base,’\\nor ‘fundamental number, which has 1/3 added to it’ (1 and 1/3) = 4/3 or\\na musical fourth. (greek) is a ‘proportion’ of numbers as of musical\\nnotes, applied either to the parts or factors of a single number or to\\nthe relation of one number to another. the first harmony is a ‘square’\\nnumber (greek); the second harmony is an ‘oblong’ number (greek), i.e.\\na number representing a figure of which the opposite sides only are\\nequal. (greek) = ‘numbers squared from’ or ‘upon diameters’; (greek) =\\n‘rational,’ i.e. omitting fractions, (greek), ‘irrational,’ i.e.\\nincluding fractions; e.g. 49 is a square of the rational diameter of a\\nfigure the side of which = 5: 50, of an irrational diameter of the\\nsame. for several of the explanations here given and for a good deal\\nbesides i am indebted to an excellent article on the platonic number by\\ndr. donaldson (proc. of the philol. society).\\n\\nthe conclusions which he draws from these data are summed up by him as\\nfollows. having assumed that the number of the perfect or divine cycle\\nis the number of the world, and the number of the imperfect cycle the\\nnumber of the state, he proceeds: ‘the period of the world is defined\\nby the perfect number 6, that of the state by the cube of that number\\nor 216, which is the product of the last pair of terms in the platonic\\ntetractys (a series of seven terms, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27); and if we\\ntake this as the basis of our computation, we shall have two cube\\nnumbers (greek), viz. 8 and 27; and the mean proportionals between\\nthese, viz. 12 and 18, will furnish three intervals and four terms, and\\nthese terms and intervals stand related to one another in the\\nsesqui-altera ratio, i.e. each term is to the preceding as 3/2. now if\\nwe remember that the number 216 = 8 x 27 = 3 cubed + 4 cubed + 5 cubed,\\nand 3 squared + 4 squared = 5 squared, we must admit that this number\\nimplies the numbers 3, 4, 5, to which musicians attach so much\\nimportance. and if we combine the ratio 4/3 with the number 5, or\\nmultiply the ratios of the sides by the hypotenuse, we shall by first\\nsquaring and then cubing obtain two expressions, which denote the ratio\\nof the two last pairs of terms in the platonic tetractys, the former\\nmultiplied by the square, the latter by the cube of the number 10, the\\nsum of the first four digits which constitute the platonic tetractys.’\\nthe two (greek) he elsewhere explains as follows: ‘the first (greek) is\\n(greek), in other words (4/3 x 5) all squared = 100 x 2 squared over 3\\nsquared. the second (greek), a cube of the same root, is described as\\n100 multiplied (alpha) by the rational diameter of 5 diminished by\\nunity, i.e., as shown above, 48: (beta) by two incommensurable\\ndiameters, i.e. the two first irrationals, or 2 and 3: and (gamma) by\\nthe cube of 3, or 27. thus we have (48 + 5 + 27) 100 = 1000 x 2 cubed.\\nthis second harmony is to be the cube of the number of which the former\\nharmony is the square, and therefore must be divided by the cube of 3.\\nin other words, the whole expression will be: (1), for the first\\nharmony, 400/9: (2), for the second harmony, 8000/27.’\\n\\nthe reasons which have inclined me to agree with dr. donaldson and also\\nwith schleiermacher in supposing that 216 is the platonic number of\\nbirths are: (1) that it coincides with the description of the number\\ngiven in the first part of the passage (greek...): (2) that the number\\n216 with its permutations would have been familiar to a greek\\nmathematician, though unfamiliar to us: (3) that 216 is the cube of 6,\\nand also the sum of 3 cubed, 4 cubed, 5 cubed, the numbers 3, 4, 5\\nrepresenting the pythagorean triangle, of which the sides when squared\\nequal the square of the hypotenuse (9 + 16 = 25): (4) that it is also\\nthe period of the pythagorean metempsychosis: (5) the three ultimate\\nterms or bases (3, 4, 5) of which 216 is composed answer to the third,\\nfourth, fifth in the musical scale: (6) that the number 216 is the\\nproduct of the cubes of 2 and 3, which are the two last terms in the\\nplatonic tetractys: (7) that the pythagorean triangle is said by\\nplutarch (de is. et osir.), proclus (super prima eucl.), and quintilian\\n(de musica) to be contained in this passage, so that the tradition of\\nthe school seems to point in the same direction: (8) that the\\npythagorean triangle is called also the figure of marriage (greek).\\n\\nbut though agreeing with dr. donaldson thus far, i see no reason for\\nsupposing, as he does, that the first or perfect number is the world,\\nthe human or imperfect number the state; nor has he given any proof\\nthat the second harmony is a cube. nor do i think that (greek) can mean\\n‘two incommensurables,’ which he arbitrarily assumes to be 2 and 3, but\\nrather, as the preceding clause implies, (greek), i.e. two square\\nnumbers based upon irrational diameters of a figure the side of which\\nis 5 = 50 x 2.\\n\\nthe greatest objection to the translation is the sense given to the\\nwords (greek), ‘a base of three with a third added to it, multiplied by\\n5.’ in this somewhat forced manner plato introduces once more the\\nnumbers of the pythagorean triangle. but the coincidences in the\\nnumbers which follow are in favour of the explanation. the first\\nharmony of 400, as has been already remarked, probably represents the\\nrulers; the second and oblong harmony of 7600, the people.\\n\\nand here we take leave of the difficulty. the discovery of the riddle\\nwould be useless, and would throw no light on ancient mathematics. the\\npoint of interest is that plato should have used such a symbol, and\\nthat so much of the pythagorean spirit should have prevailed in him.\\nhis general meaning is that divine creation is perfect, and is\\nrepresented or presided over by a perfect or cyclical number; human\\ngeneration is imperfect, and represented or presided over by an\\nimperfect number or series of numbers. the number 5040, which is the\\nnumber of the citizens in the laws, is expressly based by him on\\nutilitarian grounds, namely, the convenience of the number for\\ndivision; it is also made up of the first seven digits multiplied by\\none another. the contrast of the perfect and imperfect number may have\\nbeen easily suggested by the corrections of the cycle, which were made\\nfirst by meton and secondly by callippus; (the latter is said to have\\nbeen a pupil of plato). of the degree of importance or of exactness to\\nbe attributed to the problem, the number of the tyrant in book ix (729\\n= 365 x 2), and the slight correction of the error in the number\\n5040/12 (laws), may furnish a criterion. there is nothing surprising in\\nthe circumstance that those who were seeking for order in nature and\\nhad found order in number, should have imagined one to give law to the\\nother. plato believes in a power of number far beyond what he could see\\nrealized in the world around him, and he knows the great influence\\nwhich ‘the little matter of 1, 2, 3’ exercises upon education. he may\\neven be thought to have a prophetic anticipation of the discoveries of\\nquetelet and others, that numbers depend upon numbers; e.g.—in\\npopulation, the numbers of births and the respective numbers of\\nchildren born of either sex, on the respective ages of parents, i.e. on\\nother numbers.\\n\\nbook ix. last of all comes the tyrannical man, about whom we have to\\nenquire, whence is he, and how does he live—in happiness or in misery?\\nthere is, however, a previous question of the nature and number of the\\nappetites, which i should like to consider first. some of them are\\nunlawful, and yet admit of being chastened and weakened in various\\ndegrees by the power of reason and law. ‘what appetites do you mean?’ i\\nmean those which are awake when the reasoning powers are asleep, which\\nget up and walk about naked without any self-respect or shame; and\\nthere is no conceivable folly or crime, however cruel or unnatural, of\\nwhich, in imagination, they may not be guilty. ‘true,’ he said; ‘very\\ntrue.’ but when a man’s pulse beats temperately; and he has supped on a\\nfeast of reason and come to a knowledge of himself before going to\\nrest, and has satisfied his desires just enough to prevent their\\nperturbing his reason, which remains clear and luminous, and when he is\\nfree from quarrel and heat,—the visions which he has on his bed are\\nleast irregular and abnormal. even in good men there is such an\\nirregular wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep.\\n\\nto return:—you remember what was said of the democrat; that he was the\\nson of a miserly father, who encouraged the saving desires and\\nrepressed the ornamental and expensive ones; presently the youth got\\ninto fine company, and began to entertain a dislike to his father’s\\nnarrow ways; and being a better man than the corrupters of his youth,\\nhe came to a mean, and led a life, not of lawless or slavish passion,\\nbut of regular and successive indulgence. now imagine that the youth\\nhas become a father, and has a son who is exposed to the same\\ntemptations, and has companions who lead him into every sort of\\niniquity, and parents and friends who try to keep him right. the\\ncounsellors of evil find that their only chance of retaining him is to\\nimplant in his soul a monster drone, or love; while other desires buzz\\naround him and mystify him with sweet sounds and scents, this monster\\nlove takes possession of him, and puts an end to every true or modest\\nthought or wish. love, like drunkenness and madness, is a tyranny; and\\nthe tyrannical man, whether made by nature or habit, is just a\\ndrinking, lusting, furious sort of animal.\\n\\nand how does such an one live? ‘nay, that you must tell me.’ well then,\\ni fancy that he will live amid revelries and harlotries, and love will\\nbe the lord and master of the house. many desires require much money,\\nand so he spends all that he has and borrows more; and when he has\\nnothing the young ravens are still in the nest in which they were\\nhatched, crying for food. love urges them on; and they must be\\ngratified by force or fraud, or if not, they become painful and\\ntroublesome; and as the new pleasures succeed the old ones, so will the\\nson take possession of the goods of his parents; if they show signs of\\nrefusing, he will defraud and deceive them; and if they openly resist,\\nwhat then? ‘i can only say, that i should not much like to be in their\\nplace.’ but, o heavens, adeimantus, to think that for some new-fangled\\nand unnecessary love he will give up his old father and mother, best\\nand dearest of friends, or enslave them to the fancies of the hour!\\ntruly a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother! when\\nthere is no more to be got out of them, he turns burglar or pickpocket,\\nor robs a temple. love overmasters the thoughts of his youth, and he\\nbecomes in sober reality the monster that he was sometimes in sleep. he\\nwaxes strong in all violence and lawlessness; and is ready for any deed\\nof daring that will supply the wants of his rabble-rout. in a\\nwell-ordered state there are only a few such, and these in time of war\\ngo out and become the mercenaries of a tyrant. but in time of peace\\nthey stay at home and do mischief; they are the thieves, footpads,\\ncut-purses, man-stealers of the community; or if they are able to\\nspeak, they turn false-witnesses and informers. ‘no small catalogue of\\ncrimes truly, even if the perpetrators are few.’ yes, i said; but small\\nand great are relative terms, and no crimes which are committed by them\\napproach those of the tyrant, whom this class, growing strong and\\nnumerous, create out of themselves. if the people yield, well and good,\\nbut, if they resist, then, as before he beat his father and mother, so\\nnow he beats his fatherland and motherland, and places his mercenaries\\nover them. such men in their early days live with flatterers, and they\\nthemselves flatter others, in order to gain their ends; but they soon\\ndiscard their followers when they have no longer any need of them; they\\nare always either masters or servants,—the joys of friendship are\\nunknown to them. and they are utterly treacherous and unjust, if the\\nnature of justice be at all understood by us. they realize our dream;\\nand he who is the most of a tyrant by nature, and leads the life of a\\ntyrant for the longest time, will be the worst of them, and being the\\nworst of them, will also be the most miserable.\\n\\nlike man, like state,—the tyrannical man will answer to tyranny, which\\nis the extreme opposite of the royal state; for one is the best and the\\nother the worst. but which is the happier? great and terrible as the\\ntyrant may appear enthroned amid his satellites, let us not be afraid\\nto go in and ask; and the answer is, that the monarchical is the\\nhappiest, and the tyrannical the most miserable of states. and may we\\nnot ask the same question about the men themselves, requesting some one\\nto look into them who is able to penetrate the inner nature of man, and\\nwill not be panic-struck by the vain pomp of tyranny? i will suppose\\nthat he is one who has lived with him, and has seen him in family life,\\nor perhaps in the hour of trouble and danger.\\n\\nassuming that we ourselves are the impartial judge for whom we seek,\\nlet us begin by comparing the individual and state, and ask first of\\nall, whether the state is likely to be free or enslaved—will there not\\nbe a little freedom and a great deal of slavery? and the freedom is of\\nthe bad, and the slavery of the good; and this applies to the man as\\nwell as to the state; for his soul is full of meanness and slavery, and\\nthe better part is enslaved to the worse. he cannot do what he would,\\nand his mind is full of confusion; he is the very reverse of a freeman.\\nthe state will be poor and full of misery and sorrow; and the man’s\\nsoul will also be poor and full of sorrows, and he will be the most\\nmiserable of men. no, not the most miserable, for there is yet a more\\nmiserable. ‘who is that?’ the tyrannical man who has the misfortune\\nalso to become a public tyrant. ‘there i suspect that you are right.’\\nsay rather, ‘i am sure;’ conjecture is out of place in an enquiry of\\nthis nature. he is like a wealthy owner of slaves, only he has more of\\nthem than any private individual. you will say, ‘the owners of slaves\\nare not generally in any fear of them.’ but why? because the whole city\\nis in a league which protects the individual. suppose however that one\\nof these owners and his household is carried off by a god into a\\nwilderness, where there are no freemen to help him—will he not be in an\\nagony of terror?—will he not be compelled to flatter his slaves and to\\npromise them many things sore against his will? and suppose the same\\ngod who carried him off were to surround him with neighbours who\\ndeclare that no man ought to have slaves, and that the owners of them\\nshould be punished with death. ‘still worse and worse! he will be in\\nthe midst of his enemies.’ and is not our tyrant such a captive soul,\\nwho is tormented by a swarm of passions which he cannot indulge; living\\nindoors always like a woman, and jealous of those who can go out and\\nsee the world?\\n\\nhaving so many evils, will not the most miserable of men be still more\\nmiserable in a public station? master of others when he is not master\\nof himself; like a sick man who is compelled to be an athlete; the\\nmeanest of slaves and the most abject of flatterers; wanting all\\nthings, and never able to satisfy his desires; always in fear and\\ndistraction, like the state of which he is the representative. his\\njealous, hateful, faithless temper grows worse with command; he is more\\nand more faithless, envious, unrighteous,—the most wretched of men, a\\nmisery to himself and to others. and so let us have a final trial and\\nproclamation; need we hire a herald, or shall i proclaim the result?\\n‘made the proclamation yourself.’ the son of ariston (the best) is of\\nopinion that the best and justest of men is also the happiest, and that\\nthis is he who is the most royal master of himself; and that the unjust\\nman is he who is the greatest tyrant of himself and of his state. and i\\nadd further—‘seen or unseen by gods or men.’\\n\\nthis is our first proof. the second is derived from the three kinds of\\npleasure, which answer to the three elements of the soul—reason,\\npassion, desire; under which last is comprehended avarice as well as\\nsensual appetite, while passion includes ambition, party-feeling, love\\nof reputation. reason, again, is solely directed to the attainment of\\ntruth, and careless of money and reputation. in accordance with the\\ndifference of men’s natures, one of these three principles is in the\\nascendant, and they have their several pleasures corresponding to them.\\ninterrogate now the three natures, and each one will be found praising\\nhis own pleasures and depreciating those of others. the money-maker\\nwill contrast the vanity of knowledge with the solid advantages of\\nwealth. the ambitious man will despise knowledge which brings no\\nhonour; whereas the philosopher will regard only the fruition of truth,\\nand will call other pleasures necessary rather than good. now, how\\nshall we decide between them? is there any better criterion than\\nexperience and knowledge? and which of the three has the truest\\nknowledge and the widest experience? the experience of youth makes the\\nphilosopher acquainted with the two kinds of desire, but the avaricious\\nand the ambitious man never taste the pleasures of truth and wisdom.\\nhonour he has equally with them; they are ‘judged of him,’ but he is\\n‘not judged of them,’ for they never attain to the knowledge of true\\nbeing. and his instrument is reason, whereas their standard is only\\nwealth and honour; and if by reason we are to judge, his good will be\\nthe truest. and so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the\\nrational part of the soul, and a life passed in such pleasure is the\\npleasantest. he who has a right to judge judges thus. next comes the\\nlife of ambition, and, in the third place, that of money-making.\\n\\ntwice has the just man overthrown the unjust—once more, as in an\\nolympian contest, first offering up a prayer to the saviour zeus, let\\nhim try a fall. a wise man whispers to me that the pleasures of the\\nwise are true and pure; all others are a shadow only. let us examine\\nthis: is not pleasure opposed to pain, and is there not a mean state\\nwhich is neither? when a man is sick, nothing is more pleasant to him\\nthan health. but this he never found out while he was well. in pain he\\ndesires only to cease from pain; on the other hand, when he is in an\\necstasy of pleasure, rest is painful to him. thus rest or cessation is\\nboth pleasure and pain. but can that which is neither become both?\\nagain, pleasure and pain are motions, and the absence of them is rest;\\nbut if so, how can the absence of either of them be the other? thus we\\nare led to infer that the contradiction is an appearance only, and\\nwitchery of the senses. and these are not the only pleasures, for there\\nare others which have no preceding pains. pure pleasure then is not the\\nabsence of pain, nor pure pain the absence of pleasure; although most\\nof the pleasures which reach the mind through the body are reliefs of\\npain, and have not only their reactions when they depart, but their\\nanticipations before they come. they can be best described in a simile.\\nthere is in nature an upper, lower, and middle region, and he who\\npasses from the lower to the middle imagines that he is going up and is\\nalready in the upper world; and if he were taken back again would\\nthink, and truly think, that he was descending. all this arises out of\\nhis ignorance of the true upper, middle, and lower regions. and a like\\nconfusion happens with pleasure and pain, and with many other things.\\nthe man who compares grey with black, calls grey white; and the man who\\ncompares absence of pain with pain, calls the absence of pain pleasure.\\nagain, hunger and thirst are inanitions of the body, ignorance and\\nfolly of the soul; and food is the satisfaction of the one, knowledge\\nof the other. now which is the purer satisfaction—that of eating and\\ndrinking, or that of knowledge? consider the matter thus: the\\nsatisfaction of that which has more existence is truer than of that\\nwhich has less. the invariable and immortal has a more real existence\\nthan the variable and mortal, and has a corresponding measure of\\nknowledge and truth. the soul, again, has more existence and truth and\\nknowledge than the body, and is therefore more really satisfied and has\\na more natural pleasure. those who feast only on earthly food, are\\nalways going at random up to the middle and down again; but they never\\npass into the true upper world, or have a taste of true pleasure. they\\nare like fatted beasts, full of gluttony and sensuality, and ready to\\nkill one another by reason of their insatiable lust; for they are not\\nfilled with true being, and their vessel is leaky (gorgias). their\\npleasures are mere shadows of pleasure, mixed with pain, coloured and\\nintensified by contrast, and therefore intensely desired; and men go\\nfighting about them, as stesichorus says that the greeks fought about\\nthe shadow of helen at troy, because they know not the truth.\\n\\nthe same may be said of the passionate element:—the desires of the\\nambitious soul, as well as of the covetous, have an inferior\\nsatisfaction. only when under the guidance of reason do either of the\\nother principles do their own business or attain the pleasure which is\\nnatural to them. when not attaining, they compel the other parts of the\\nsoul to pursue a shadow of pleasure which is not theirs. and the more\\ndistant they are from philosophy and reason, the more distant they will\\nbe from law and order, and the more illusive will be their pleasures.\\nthe desires of love and tyranny are the farthest from law, and those of\\nthe king are nearest to it. there is one genuine pleasure, and two\\nspurious ones: the tyrant goes beyond even the latter; he has run away\\naltogether from law and reason. nor can the measure of his inferiority\\nbe told, except in a figure. the tyrant is the third removed from the\\noligarch, and has therefore, not a shadow of his pleasure, but the\\nshadow of a shadow only. the oligarch, again, is thrice removed from\\nthe king, and thus we get the formula 3 x 3, which is the number of a\\nsurface, representing the shadow which is the tyrant’s pleasure, and if\\nyou like to cube this ‘number of the beast,’ you will find that the\\nmeasure of the difference amounts to 729; the king is 729 times more\\nhappy than the tyrant. and this extraordinary number is nearly equal to\\nthe number of days and nights in a year (365 x 2 = 730); and is\\ntherefore concerned with human life. this is the interval between a\\ngood and bad man in happiness only: what must be the difference between\\nthem in comeliness of life and virtue!\\n\\nperhaps you may remember some one saying at the beginning of our\\ndiscussion that the unjust man was profited if he had the reputation of\\njustice. now that we know the nature of justice and injustice, let us\\nmake an image of the soul, which will personify his words. first of\\nall, fashion a multitudinous beast, having a ring of heads of all\\nmanner of animals, tame and wild, and able to produce and change them\\nat pleasure. suppose now another form of a lion, and another of a man;\\nthe second smaller than the first, the third than the second; join them\\ntogether and cover them with a human skin, in which they are completely\\nconcealed. when this has been done, let us tell the supporter of\\ninjustice that he is feeding up the beasts and starving the man. the\\nmaintainer of justice, on the other hand, is trying to strengthen the\\nman; he is nourishing the gentle principle within him, and making an\\nalliance with the lion heart, in order that he may be able to keep down\\nthe many-headed hydra, and bring all into unity with each other and\\nwith themselves. thus in every point of view, whether in relation to\\npleasure, honour, or advantage, the just man is right, and the unjust\\nwrong.\\n\\nbut now, let us reason with the unjust, who is not intentionally in\\nerror. is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man, or\\nrather to the god in man; the ignoble, that which subjects the man to\\nthe beast? and if so, who would receive gold on condition that he was\\nto degrade the noblest part of himself under the worst?—who would sell\\nhis son or daughter into the hands of brutal and evil men, for any\\namount of money? and will he sell his own fairer and diviner part\\nwithout any compunction to the most godless and foul? would he not be\\nworse than eriphyle, who sold her husband’s life for a necklace? and\\nintemperance is the letting loose of the multiform monster, and pride\\nand sullenness are the growth and increase of the lion and serpent\\nelement, while luxury and effeminacy are caused by a too great\\nrelaxation of spirit. flattery and meanness again arise when the\\nspirited element is subjected to avarice, and the lion is habituated to\\nbecome a monkey. the real disgrace of handicraft arts is, that those\\nwho are engaged in them have to flatter, instead of mastering their\\ndesires; therefore we say that they should be placed under the control\\nof the better principle in another because they have none in\\nthemselves; not, as thrasymachus imagined, to the injury of the\\nsubjects, but for their good. and our intention in educating the young,\\nis to give them self-control; the law desires to nurse up in them a\\nhigher principle, and when they have acquired this, they may go their\\nways.\\n\\n‘what, then, shall a man profit, if he gain the whole world’ and become\\nmore and more wicked? or what shall he profit by escaping discovery, if\\nthe concealment of evil prevents the cure? if he had been punished, the\\nbrute within him would have been silenced, and the gentler element\\nliberated; and he would have united temperance, justice, and wisdom in\\nhis soul—a union better far than any combination of bodily gifts. the\\nman of understanding will honour knowledge above all; in the next place\\nhe will keep under his body, not only for the sake of health and\\nstrength, but in order to attain the most perfect harmony of body and\\nsoul. in the acquisition of riches, too, he will aim at order and\\nharmony; he will not desire to heap up wealth without measure, but he\\nwill fear that the increase of wealth will disturb the constitution of\\nhis own soul. for the same reason he will only accept such honours as\\nwill make him a better man; any others he will decline. ‘in that case,’\\nsaid he, ‘he will never be a politician.’ yes, but he will, in his own\\ncity; though probably not in his native country, unless by some divine\\naccident. ‘you mean that he will be a citizen of the ideal city, which\\nhas no place upon earth.’ but in heaven, i replied, there is a pattern\\nof such a city, and he who wishes may order his life after that image.\\nwhether such a state is or ever will be matters not; he will act\\naccording to that pattern and no other...\\n\\nthe most noticeable points in the 9th book of the republic are:—(1) the\\naccount of pleasure; (2) the number of the interval which divides the\\nking from the tyrant; (3) the pattern which is in heaven.\\n\\n1. plato’s account of pleasure is remarkable for moderation, and in\\nthis respect contrasts with the later platonists and the views which\\nare attributed to them by aristotle. he is not, like the cynics,\\nopposed to all pleasure, but rather desires that the several parts of\\nthe soul shall have their natural satisfaction; he even agrees with the\\nepicureans in describing pleasure as something more than the absence of\\npain. this is proved by the circumstance that there are pleasures which\\nhave no antecedent pains (as he also remarks in the philebus), such as\\nthe pleasures of smell, and also the pleasures of hope and\\nanticipation. in the previous book he had made the distinction between\\nnecessary and unnecessary pleasure, which is repeated by aristotle, and\\nhe now observes that there are a further class of ‘wild beast’\\npleasures, corresponding to aristotle’s (greek). he dwells upon the\\nrelative and unreal character of sensual pleasures and the illusion\\nwhich arises out of the contrast of pleasure and pain, pointing out the\\nsuperiority of the pleasures of reason, which are at rest, over the\\nfleeting pleasures of sense and emotion. the pre-eminence of royal\\npleasure is shown by the fact that reason is able to form a judgment of\\nthe lower pleasures, while the two lower parts of the soul are\\nincapable of judging the pleasures of reason. thus, in his treatment of\\npleasure, as in many other subjects, the philosophy of plato is ‘sawn\\nup into quantities’ by aristotle; the analysis which was originally\\nmade by him became in the next generation the foundation of further\\ntechnical distinctions. both in plato and aristotle we note the\\nillusion under which the ancients fell of regarding the transience of\\npleasure as a proof of its unreality, and of confounding the permanence\\nof the intellectual pleasures with the unchangeableness of the\\nknowledge from which they are derived. neither do we like to admit that\\nthe pleasures of knowledge, though more elevating, are not more lasting\\nthan other pleasures, and are almost equally dependent on the accidents\\nof our bodily state (introduction to philebus).\\n\\n2. the number of the interval which separates the king from the tyrant,\\nand royal from tyrannical pleasures, is 729, the cube of 9. which plato\\ncharacteristically designates as a number concerned with human life,\\nbecause nearly equivalent to the number of days and nights in the year.\\nhe is desirous of proclaiming that the interval between them is\\nimmeasurable, and invents a formula to give expression to his idea.\\nthose who spoke of justice as a cube, of virtue as an art of measuring\\n(prot.), saw no inappropriateness in conceiving the soul under the\\nfigure of a line, or the pleasure of the tyrant as separated from the\\npleasure of the king by the numerical interval of 729. and in modern\\ntimes we sometimes use metaphorically what plato employed as a\\nphilosophical formula. ‘it is not easy to estimate the loss of the\\ntyrant, except perhaps in this way,’ says plato. so we might say, that\\nalthough the life of a good man is not to be compared to that of a bad\\nman, yet you may measure the difference between them by valuing one\\nminute of the one at an hour of the other (‘one day in thy courts is\\nbetter than a thousand’), or you might say that ‘there is an infinite\\ndifference.’ but this is not so much as saying, in homely phrase, ‘they\\nare a thousand miles asunder.’ and accordingly plato finds the natural\\nvehicle of his thoughts in a progression of numbers; this arithmetical\\nformula he draws out with the utmost seriousness, and both here and in\\nthe number of generation seems to find an additional proof of the truth\\nof his speculation in forming the number into a geometrical figure;\\njust as persons in our own day are apt to fancy that a statement is\\nverified when it has been only thrown into an abstract form. in\\nspeaking of the number 729 as proper to human life, he probably\\nintended to intimate that one year of the tyrannical = 12 hours of the\\nroyal life.\\n\\nthe simple observation that the comparison of two similar solids is\\neffected by the comparison of the cubes of their sides, is the\\nmathematical groundwork of this fanciful expression. there is some\\ndifficulty in explaining the steps by which the number 729 is obtained;\\nthe oligarch is removed in the third degree from the royal and\\naristocratical, and the tyrant in the third degree from the\\noligarchical; but we have to arrange the terms as the sides of a square\\nand to count the oligarch twice over, thus reckoning them not as = 5\\nbut as = 9. the square of 9 is passed lightly over as only a step\\ntowards the cube.\\n\\n3. towards the close of the republic, plato seems to be more and more\\nconvinced of the ideal character of his own speculations. at the end of\\nthe 9th book the pattern which is in heaven takes the place of the city\\nof philosophers on earth. the vision which has received form and\\nsubstance at his hands, is now discovered to be at a distance. and yet\\nthis distant kingdom is also the rule of man’s life. (‘say not lo!\\nhere, or lo! there, for the kingdom of god is within you.’) thus a note\\nis struck which prepares for the revelation of a future life in the\\nfollowing book. but the future life is present still; the ideal of\\npolitics is to be realized in the individual.\\n\\nbook x. many things pleased me in the order of our state, but there was\\nnothing which i liked better than the regulation about poetry. the\\ndivision of the soul throws a new light on our exclusion of imitation.\\ni do not mind telling you in confidence that all poetry is an outrage\\non the understanding, unless the hearers have that balm of knowledge\\nwhich heals error. i have loved homer ever since i was a boy, and even\\nnow he appears to me to be the great master of tragic poetry. but much\\nas i love the man, i love truth more, and therefore i must speak out:\\nand first of all, will you explain what is imitation, for really i do\\nnot understand? ‘how likely then that i should understand!’ that might\\nvery well be, for the duller often sees better than the keener eye.\\n‘true, but in your presence i can hardly venture to say what i think.’\\nthen suppose that we begin in our old fashion, with the doctrine of\\nuniversals. let us assume the existence of beds and tables. there is\\none idea of a bed, or of a table, which the maker of each had in his\\nmind when making them; he did not make the ideas of beds and tables,\\nbut he made beds and tables according to the ideas. and is there not a\\nmaker of the works of all workmen, who makes not only vessels but\\nplants and animals, himself, the earth and heaven, and things in heaven\\nand under the earth? he makes the gods also. ‘he must be a wizard\\nindeed!’ but do you not see that there is a sense in which you could do\\nthe same? you have only to take a mirror, and catch the reflection of\\nthe sun, and the earth, or anything else—there now you have made them.\\n‘yes, but only in appearance.’ exactly so; and the painter is such a\\ncreator as you are with the mirror, and he is even more unreal than the\\ncarpenter; although neither the carpenter nor any other artist can be\\nsupposed to make the absolute bed. ‘not if philosophers may be\\nbelieved.’ nor need we wonder that his bed has but an imperfect\\nrelation to the truth. reflect:—here are three beds; one in nature,\\nwhich is made by god; another, which is made by the carpenter; and the\\nthird, by the painter. god only made one, nor could he have made more\\nthan one; for if there had been two, there would always have been a\\nthird—more absolute and abstract than either, under which they would\\nhave been included. we may therefore conceive god to be the natural\\nmaker of the bed, and in a lower sense the carpenter is also the maker;\\nbut the painter is rather the imitator of what the other two make; he\\nhas to do with a creation which is thrice removed from reality. and the\\ntragic poet is an imitator, and, like every other imitator, is thrice\\nremoved from the king and from the truth. the painter imitates not the\\noriginal bed, but the bed made by the carpenter. and this, without\\nbeing really different, appears to be different, and has many points of\\nview, of which only one is caught by the painter, who represents\\neverything because he represents a piece of everything, and that piece\\nan image. and he can paint any other artist, although he knows nothing\\nof their arts; and this with sufficient skill to deceive children or\\nsimple people. suppose now that somebody came to us and told us, how he\\nhad met a man who knew all that everybody knows, and better than\\nanybody:—should we not infer him to be a simpleton who, having no\\ndiscernment of truth and falsehood, had met with a wizard or enchanter,\\nwhom he fancied to be all-wise? and when we hear persons saying that\\nhomer and the tragedians know all the arts and all the virtues, must we\\nnot infer that they are under a similar delusion? they do not see that\\nthe poets are imitators, and that their creations are only imitations.\\n‘very true.’ but if a person could create as well as imitate, he would\\nrather leave some permanent work and not an imitation only; he would\\nrather be the receiver than the giver of praise? ‘yes, for then he\\nwould have more honour and advantage.’\\n\\nlet us now interrogate homer and the poets. friend homer, say i to him,\\ni am not going to ask you about medicine, or any art to which your\\npoems incidentally refer, but about their main subjects—war, military\\ntactics, politics. if you are only twice and not thrice removed from\\nthe truth—not an imitator or an image-maker, please to inform us what\\ngood you have ever done to mankind? is there any city which professes\\nto have received laws from you, as sicily and italy have from\\ncharondas, sparta from lycurgus, athens from solon? or was any war ever\\ncarried on by your counsels? or is any invention attributed to you, as\\nthere is to thales and anacharsis? or is there any homeric way of life,\\nsuch as the pythagorean was, in which you instructed men, and which is\\ncalled after you? ‘no, indeed; and creophylus (flesh-child) was even\\nmore unfortunate in his breeding than he was in his name, if, as\\ntradition says, homer in his lifetime was allowed by him and his other\\nfriends to starve.’ yes, but could this ever have happened if homer had\\nreally been the educator of hellas? would he not have had many devoted\\nfollowers? if protagoras and prodicus can persuade their contemporaries\\nthat no one can manage house or state without them, is it likely that\\nhomer and hesiod would have been allowed to go about as beggars—i mean\\nif they had really been able to do the world any good?—would not men\\nhave compelled them to stay where they were, or have followed them\\nabout in order to get education? but they did not; and therefore we may\\ninfer that homer and all the poets are only imitators, who do but\\nimitate the appearances of things. for as a painter by a knowledge of\\nfigure and colour can paint a cobbler without any practice in cobbling,\\nso the poet can delineate any art in the colours of language, and give\\nharmony and rhythm to the cobbler and also to the general; and you know\\nhow mere narration, when deprived of the ornaments of metre, is like a\\nface which has lost the beauty of youth and never had any other. once\\nmore, the imitator has no knowledge of reality, but only of appearance.\\nthe painter paints, and the artificer makes a bridle and reins, but\\nneither understands the use of them—the knowledge of this is confined\\nto the horseman; and so of other things. thus we have three arts: one\\nof use, another of invention, a third of imitation; and the user\\nfurnishes the rule to the two others. the flute-player will know the\\ngood and bad flute, and the maker will put faith in him; but the\\nimitator will neither know nor have faith—neither science nor true\\nopinion can be ascribed to him. imitation, then, is devoid of\\nknowledge, being only a kind of play or sport, and the tragic and epic\\npoets are imitators in the highest degree.\\n\\nand now let us enquire, what is the faculty in man which answers to\\nimitation. allow me to explain my meaning: objects are differently seen\\nwhen in the water and when out of the water, when near and when at a\\ndistance; and the painter or juggler makes use of this variation to\\nimpose upon us. and the art of measuring and weighing and calculating\\ncomes in to save our bewildered minds from the power of appearance;\\nfor, as we were saying, two contrary opinions of the same about the\\nsame and at the same time, cannot both of them be true. but which of\\nthem is true is determined by the art of calculation; and this is\\nallied to the better faculty in the soul, as the arts of imitation are\\nto the worse. and the same holds of the ear as well as of the eye, of\\npoetry as well as painting. the imitation is of actions voluntary or\\ninvoluntary, in which there is an expectation of a good or bad result,\\nand present experience of pleasure and pain. but is a man in harmony\\nwith himself when he is the subject of these conflicting influences? is\\nthere not rather a contradiction in him? let me further ask, whether he\\nis more likely to control sorrow when he is alone or when he is in\\ncompany. ‘in the latter case.’ feeling would lead him to indulge his\\nsorrow, but reason and law control him and enjoin patience; since he\\ncannot know whether his affliction is good or evil, and no human thing\\nis of any great consequence, while sorrow is certainly a hindrance to\\ngood counsel. for when we stumble, we should not, like children, make\\nan uproar; we should take the measures which reason prescribes, not\\nraising a lament, but finding a cure. and the better part of us is\\nready to follow reason, while the irrational principle is full of\\nsorrow and distraction at the recollection of our troubles.\\nunfortunately, however, this latter furnishes the chief materials of\\nthe imitative arts. whereas reason is ever in repose and cannot easily\\nbe displayed, especially to a mixed multitude who have no experience of\\nher. thus the poet is like the painter in two ways: first he paints an\\ninferior degree of truth, and secondly, he is concerned with an\\ninferior part of the soul. he indulges the feelings, while he enfeebles\\nthe reason; and we refuse to allow him to have authority over the mind\\nof man; for he has no measure of greater and less, and is a maker of\\nimages and very far gone from truth.\\n\\nbut we have not yet mentioned the heaviest count in the indictment—the\\npower which poetry has of injuriously exciting the feelings. when we\\nhear some passage in which a hero laments his sufferings at tedious\\nlength, you know that we sympathize with him and praise the poet; and\\nyet in our own sorrows such an exhibition of feeling is regarded as\\neffeminate and unmanly (ion). now, ought a man to feel pleasure in\\nseeing another do what he hates and abominates in himself? is he not\\ngiving way to a sentiment which in his own case he would control?—he is\\noff his guard because the sorrow is another’s; and he thinks that he\\nmay indulge his feelings without disgrace, and will be the gainer by\\nthe pleasure. but the inevitable consequence is that he who begins by\\nweeping at the sorrows of others, will end by weeping at his own. the\\nsame is true of comedy,—you may often laugh at buffoonery which you\\nwould be ashamed to utter, and the love of coarse merriment on the\\nstage will at last turn you into a buffoon at home. poetry feeds and\\nwaters the passions and desires; she lets them rule instead of ruling\\nthem. and therefore, when we hear the encomiasts of homer affirming\\nthat he is the educator of hellas, and that all life should be\\nregulated by his precepts, we may allow the excellence of their\\nintentions, and agree with them in thinking homer a great poet and\\ntragedian. but we shall continue to prohibit all poetry which goes\\nbeyond hymns to the gods and praises of famous men. not pleasure and\\npain, but law and reason shall rule in our state.\\n\\nthese are our grounds for expelling poetry; but lest she should charge\\nus with discourtesy, let us also make an apology to her. we will remind\\nher that there is an ancient quarrel between poetry and philosophy, of\\nwhich there are many traces in the writings of the poets, such as the\\nsaying of ‘the she-dog, yelping at her mistress,’ and ‘the philosophers\\nwho are ready to circumvent zeus,’ and ‘the philosophers who are\\npaupers.’ nevertheless we bear her no ill-will, and will gladly allow\\nher to return upon condition that she makes a defence of herself in\\nverse; and her supporters who are not poets may speak in prose. we\\nconfess her charms; but if she cannot show that she is useful as well\\nas delightful, like rational lovers, we must renounce our love, though\\nendeared to us by early associations. having come to years of\\ndiscretion, we know that poetry is not truth, and that a man should be\\ncareful how he introduces her to that state or constitution which he\\nhimself is; for there is a mighty issue at stake—no less than the good\\nor evil of a human soul. and it is not worth while to forsake justice\\nand virtue for the attractions of poetry, any more than for the sake of\\nhonour or wealth. ‘i agree with you.’\\n\\nand yet the rewards of virtue are greater far than i have described.\\n‘and can we conceive things greater still?’ not, perhaps, in this brief\\nspan of life: but should an immortal being care about anything short of\\neternity? ‘i do not understand what you mean?’ do you not know that the\\nsoul is immortal? ‘surely you are not prepared to prove that?’ indeed i\\nam. ‘then let me hear this argument, of which you make so light.’\\n\\nyou would admit that everything has an element of good and of evil. in\\nall things there is an inherent corruption; and if this cannot destroy\\nthem, nothing else will. the soul too has her own corrupting\\nprinciples, which are injustice, intemperance, cowardice, and the like.\\nbut none of these destroy the soul in the same sense that disease\\ndestroys the body. the soul may be full of all iniquities, but is not,\\nby reason of them, brought any nearer to death. nothing which was not\\ndestroyed from within ever perished by external affection of evil. the\\nbody, which is one thing, cannot be destroyed by food, which is\\nanother, unless the badness of the food is communicated to the body.\\nneither can the soul, which is one thing, be corrupted by the body,\\nwhich is another, unless she herself is infected. and as no bodily evil\\ncan infect the soul, neither can any bodily evil, whether disease or\\nviolence, or any other destroy the soul, unless it can be shown to\\nrender her unholy and unjust. but no one will ever prove that the souls\\nof men become more unjust when they die. if a person has the audacity\\nto say the contrary, the answer is—then why do criminals require the\\nhand of the executioner, and not die of themselves? ‘truly,’ he said,\\n‘injustice would not be very terrible if it brought a cessation of\\nevil; but i rather believe that the injustice which murders others may\\ntend to quicken and stimulate the life of the unjust.’ you are quite\\nright. if sin which is her own natural and inherent evil cannot destroy\\nthe soul, hardly will anything else destroy her. but the soul which\\ncannot be destroyed either by internal or external evil must be\\nimmortal and everlasting. and if this be true, souls will always exist\\nin the same number. they cannot diminish, because they cannot be\\ndestroyed; nor yet increase, for the increase of the immortal must come\\nfrom something mortal, and so all would end in immortality. neither is\\nthe soul variable and diverse; for that which is immortal must be of\\nthe fairest and simplest composition. if we would conceive her truly,\\nand so behold justice and injustice in their own nature, she must be\\nviewed by the light of reason pure as at birth, or as she is reflected\\nin philosophy when holding converse with the divine and immortal and\\neternal. in her present condition we see her only like the sea-god\\nglaucus, bruised and maimed in the sea which is the world, and covered\\nwith shells and stones which are incrusted upon her from the\\nentertainments of earth.\\n\\nthus far, as the argument required, we have said nothing of the rewards\\nand honours which the poets attribute to justice; we have contented\\nourselves with showing that justice in herself is best for the soul in\\nherself, even if a man should put on a gyges’ ring and have the helmet\\nof hades too. and now you shall repay me what you borrowed; and i will\\nenumerate the rewards of justice in life and after death. i granted,\\nfor the sake of argument, as you will remember, that evil might perhaps\\nescape the knowledge of gods and men, although this was really\\nimpossible. and since i have shown that justice has reality, you must\\ngrant me also that she has the palm of appearance. in the first place,\\nthe just man is known to the gods, and he is therefore the friend of\\nthe gods, and he will receive at their hands every good, always\\nexcepting such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins. all\\nthings end in good to him, either in life or after death, even what\\nappears to be evil; for the gods have a care of him who desires to be\\nin their likeness. and what shall we say of men? is not honesty the\\nbest policy? the clever rogue makes a great start at first, but breaks\\ndown before he reaches the goal, and slinks away in dishonour; whereas\\nthe true runner perseveres to the end, and receives the prize. and you\\nmust allow me to repeat all the blessings which you attributed to the\\nfortunate unjust—they bear rule in the city, they marry and give in\\nmarriage to whom they will; and the evils which you attributed to the\\nunfortunate just, do really fall in the end on the unjust, although, as\\nyou implied, their sufferings are better veiled in silence.\\n\\nbut all the blessings of this present life are as nothing when compared\\nwith those which await good men after death. ‘i should like to hear\\nabout them.’ come, then, and i will tell you the story of er, the son\\nof armenius, a valiant man. he was supposed to have died in battle, but\\nten days afterwards his body was found untouched by corruption and sent\\nhome for burial. on the twelfth day he was placed on the funeral pyre\\nand there he came to life again, and told what he had seen in the world\\nbelow. he said that his soul went with a great company to a place, in\\nwhich there were two chasms near together in the earth beneath, and two\\ncorresponding chasms in the heaven above. and there were judges sitting\\nin the intermediate space, bidding the just ascend by the heavenly way\\non the right hand, having the seal of their judgment set upon them\\nbefore, while the unjust, having the seal behind, were bidden to\\ndescend by the way on the left hand. him they told to look and listen,\\nas he was to be their messenger to men from the world below. and he\\nbeheld and saw the souls departing after judgment at either chasm; some\\nwho came from earth, were worn and travel-stained; others, who came\\nfrom heaven, were clean and bright. they seemed glad to meet and rest\\nawhile in the meadow; here they discoursed with one another of what\\nthey had seen in the other world. those who came from earth wept at the\\nremembrance of their sorrows, but the spirits from above spoke of\\nglorious sights and heavenly bliss. he said that for every evil deed\\nthey were punished tenfold—now the journey was of a thousand years’\\nduration, because the life of man was reckoned as a hundred years—and\\nthe rewards of virtue were in the same proportion. he added something\\nhardly worth repeating about infants dying almost as soon as they were\\nborn. of parricides and other murderers he had tortures still more\\nterrible to narrate. he was present when one of the spirits asked—where\\nis ardiaeus the great? (this ardiaeus was a cruel tyrant, who had\\nmurdered his father, and his elder brother, a thousand years before.)\\nanother spirit answered, ‘he comes not hither, and will never come. and\\ni myself,’ he added, ‘actually saw this terrible sight. at the entrance\\nof the chasm, as we were about to reascend, ardiaeus appeared, and some\\nother sinners—most of whom had been tyrants, but not all—and just as\\nthey fancied that they were returning to life, the chasm gave a roar,\\nand then wild, fiery-looking men who knew the meaning of the sound,\\nseized him and several others, and bound them hand and foot and threw\\nthem down, and dragged them along at the side of the road, lacerating\\nthem and carding them like wool, and explaining to the passers-by, that\\nthey were going to be cast into hell.’ the greatest terror of the\\npilgrims ascending was lest they should hear the voice, and when there\\nwas silence one by one they passed up with joy. to these sufferings\\nthere were corresponding delights.\\n\\non the eighth day the souls of the pilgrims resumed their journey, and\\nin four days came to a spot whence they looked down upon a line of\\nlight, in colour like a rainbow, only brighter and clearer. one day\\nmore brought them to the place, and they saw that this was the column\\nof light which binds together the whole universe. the ends of the\\ncolumn were fastened to heaven, and from them hung the distaff of\\nnecessity, on which all the heavenly bodies turned—the hook and spindle\\nwere of adamant, and the whorl of a mixed substance. the whorl was in\\nform like a number of boxes fitting into one another with their edges\\nturned upwards, making together a single whorl which was pierced by the\\nspindle. the outermost had the rim broadest, and the inner whorls were\\nsmaller and smaller, and had their rims narrower. the largest (the\\nfixed stars) was spangled—the seventh (the sun) was brightest—the\\neighth (the moon) shone by the light of the seventh—the second and\\nfifth (saturn and mercury) were most like one another and yellower than\\nthe eighth—the third (jupiter) had the whitest light—the fourth (mars)\\nwas red—the sixth (venus) was in whiteness second. the whole had one\\nmotion, but while this was revolving in one direction the seven inner\\ncircles were moving in the opposite, with various degrees of swiftness\\nand slowness. the spindle turned on the knees of necessity, and a siren\\nstood hymning upon each circle, while lachesis, clotho, and atropos,\\nthe daughters of necessity, sat on thrones at equal intervals, singing\\nof past, present, and future, responsive to the music of the sirens;\\nclotho from time to time guiding the outer circle with a touch of her\\nright hand; atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner\\ncircles; lachesis in turn putting forth her hand from time to time to\\nguide both of them. on their arrival the pilgrims went to lachesis, and\\nthere was an interpreter who arranged them, and taking from her knees\\nlots, and samples of lives, got up into a pulpit and said: ‘mortal\\nsouls, hear the words of lachesis, the daughter of necessity. a new\\nperiod of mortal life has begun, and you may choose what divinity you\\nplease; the responsibility of choosing is with you—god is blameless.’\\nafter speaking thus, he cast the lots among them and each one took up\\nthe lot which fell near him. he then placed on the ground before them\\nthe samples of lives, many more than the souls present; and there were\\nall sorts of lives, of men and of animals. there were tyrannies ending\\nin misery and exile, and lives of men and women famous for their\\ndifferent qualities; and also mixed lives, made up of wealth and\\npoverty, sickness and health. here, glaucon, is the great risk of human\\nlife, and therefore the whole of education should be directed to the\\nacquisition of such a knowledge as will teach a man to refuse the evil\\nand choose the good. he should know all the combinations which occur in\\nlife—of beauty with poverty or with wealth,—of knowledge with external\\ngoods,—and at last choose with reference to the nature of the soul,\\nregarding that only as the better life which makes men better, and\\nleaving the rest. and a man must take with him an iron sense of truth\\nand right into the world below, that there too he may remain undazzled\\nby wealth or the allurements of evil, and be determined to avoid the\\nextremes and choose the mean. for this, as the messenger reported the\\ninterpreter to have said, is the true happiness of man; and any one, as\\nhe proclaimed, may, if he choose with understanding, have a good lot,\\neven though he come last. ‘let not the first be careless in his choice,\\nnor the last despair.’ he spoke; and when he had spoken, he who had\\ndrawn the first lot chose a tyranny: he did not see that he was fated\\nto devour his own children—and when he discovered his mistake, he wept\\nand beat his breast, blaming chance and the gods and anybody rather\\nthan himself. he was one of those who had come from heaven, and in his\\nprevious life had been a citizen of a well-ordered state, but he had\\nonly habit and no philosophy. like many another, he made a bad choice,\\nbecause he had no experience of life; whereas those who came from earth\\nand had seen trouble were not in such a hurry to choose. but if a man\\nhad followed philosophy while upon earth, and had been moderately\\nfortunate in his lot, he might not only be happy here, but his\\npilgrimage both from and to this world would be smooth and heavenly.\\nnothing was more curious than the spectacle of the choice, at once sad\\nand laughable and wonderful; most of the souls only seeking to avoid\\ntheir own condition in a previous life. he saw the soul of orpheus\\nchanging into a swan because he would not be born of a woman; there was\\nthamyras becoming a nightingale; musical birds, like the swan, choosing\\nto be men; the twentieth soul, which was that of ajax, preferring the\\nlife of a lion to that of a man, in remembrance of the injustice which\\nwas done to him in the judgment of the arms; and agamemnon, from a like\\nenmity to human nature, passing into an eagle. about the middle was the\\nsoul of atalanta choosing the honours of an athlete, and next to her\\nepeus taking the nature of a workwoman; among the last was thersites,\\nwho was changing himself into a monkey. thither, the last of all, came\\nodysseus, and sought the lot of a private man, which lay neglected and\\ndespised, and when he found it he went away rejoicing, and said that if\\nhe had been first instead of last, his choice would have been the same.\\nmen, too, were seen passing into animals, and wild and tame animals\\nchanging into one another.\\n\\nwhen all the souls had chosen they went to lachesis, who sent with each\\nof them their genius or attendant to fulfil their lot. he first of all\\nbrought them under the hand of clotho, and drew them within the\\nrevolution of the spindle impelled by her hand; from her they were\\ncarried to atropos, who made the threads irreversible; whence, without\\nturning round, they passed beneath the throne of necessity; and when\\nthey had all passed, they moved on in scorching heat to the plain of\\nforgetfulness and rested at evening by the river unmindful, whose water\\ncould not be retained in any vessel; of this they had all to drink a\\ncertain quantity—some of them drank more than was required, and he who\\ndrank forgot all things. er himself was prevented from drinking. when\\nthey had gone to rest, about the middle of the night there were\\nthunderstorms and earthquakes, and suddenly they were all driven divers\\nways, shooting like stars to their birth. concerning his return to the\\nbody, he only knew that awaking suddenly in the morning he found\\nhimself lying on the pyre.\\n\\nthus, glaucon, the tale has been saved, and will be our salvation, if\\nwe believe that the soul is immortal, and hold fast to the heavenly way\\nof justice and knowledge. so shall we pass undefiled over the river of\\nforgetfulness, and be dear to ourselves and to the gods, and have a\\ncrown of reward and happiness both in this world and also in the\\nmillennial pilgrimage of the other.\\n\\nthe tenth book of the republic of plato falls into two divisions:\\nfirst, resuming an old thread which has been interrupted, socrates\\nassails the poets, who, now that the nature of the soul has been\\nanalyzed, are seen to be very far gone from the truth; and secondly,\\nhaving shown the reality of the happiness of the just, he demands that\\nappearance shall be restored to him, and then proceeds to prove the\\nimmortality of the soul. the argument, as in the phaedo and gorgias, is\\nsupplemented by the vision of a future life.\\n\\nwhy plato, who was himself a poet, and whose dialogues are poems and\\ndramas, should have been hostile to the poets as a class, and\\nespecially to the dramatic poets; why he should not have seen that\\ntruth may be embodied in verse as well as in prose, and that there are\\nsome indefinable lights and shadows of human life which can only be\\nexpressed in poetry—some elements of imagination which always entwine\\nwith reason; why he should have supposed epic verse to be inseparably\\nassociated with the impurities of the old hellenic mythology; why he\\nshould try homer and hesiod by the unfair and prosaic test of\\nutility,—are questions which have always been debated amongst students\\nof plato. though unable to give a complete answer to them, we may\\nshow—first, that his views arose naturally out of the circumstances of\\nhis age; and secondly, we may elicit the truth as well as the error\\nwhich is contained in them.\\n\\nhe is the enemy of the poets because poetry was declining in his own\\nlifetime, and a theatrocracy, as he says in the laws, had taken the\\nplace of an intellectual aristocracy. euripides exhibited the last\\nphase of the tragic drama, and in him plato saw the friend and\\napologist of tyrants, and the sophist of tragedy. the old comedy was\\nalmost extinct; the new had not yet arisen. dramatic and lyric poetry,\\nlike every other branch of greek literature, was falling under the\\npower of rhetoric. there was no ‘second or third’ to aeschylus and\\nsophocles in the generation which followed them. aristophanes, in one\\nof his later comedies (frogs), speaks of ‘thousands of tragedy-making\\nprattlers,’ whose attempts at poetry he compares to the chirping of\\nswallows; ‘their garrulity went far beyond euripides,’—‘they appeared\\nonce upon the stage, and there was an end of them.’ to a man of genius\\nwho had a real appreciation of the godlike aeschylus and the noble and\\ngentle sophocles, though disagreeing with some parts of their\\n‘theology’ (rep.), these ‘minor poets’ must have been contemptible and\\nintolerable. there is no feeling stronger in the dialogues of plato\\nthan a sense of the decline and decay both in literature and in\\npolitics which marked his own age. nor can he have been expected to\\nlook with favour on the licence of aristophanes, now at the end of his\\ncareer, who had begun by satirizing socrates in the clouds, and in a\\nsimilar spirit forty years afterwards had satirized the founders of\\nideal commonwealths in his eccleziazusae, or female parliament (laws).\\n\\nthere were other reasons for the antagonism of plato to poetry. the\\nprofession of an actor was regarded by him as a degradation of human\\nnature, for ‘one man in his life’ cannot ‘play many parts;’ the\\ncharacters which the actor performs seem to destroy his own character,\\nand to leave nothing which can be truly called himself. neither can any\\nman live his life and act it. the actor is the slave of his art, not\\nthe master of it. taking this view plato is more decided in his\\nexpulsion of the dramatic than of the epic poets, though he must have\\nknown that the greek tragedians afforded noble lessons and examples of\\nvirtue and patriotism, to which nothing in homer can be compared. but\\ngreat dramatic or even great rhetorical power is hardly consistent with\\nfirmness or strength of mind, and dramatic talent is often incidentally\\nassociated with a weak or dissolute character.\\n\\nin the tenth book plato introduces a new series of objections. first,\\nhe says that the poet or painter is an imitator, and in the third\\ndegree removed from the truth. his creations are not tested by rule and\\nmeasure; they are only appearances. in modern times we should say that\\nart is not merely imitation, but rather the expression of the ideal in\\nforms of sense. even adopting the humble image of plato, from which his\\nargument derives a colour, we should maintain that the artist may\\nennoble the bed which he paints by the folds of the drapery, or by the\\nfeeling of home which he introduces; and there have been modern\\npainters who have imparted such an ideal interest to a blacksmith’s or\\na carpenter’s shop. the eye or mind which feels as well as sees can\\ngive dignity and pathos to a ruined mill, or a straw-built shed\\n(rembrandt), to the hull of a vessel ‘going to its last home’ (turner).\\nstill more would this apply to the greatest works of art, which seem to\\nbe the visible embodiment of the divine. had plato been asked whether\\nthe zeus or athene of pheidias was the imitation of an imitation only,\\nwould he not have been compelled to admit that something more was to be\\nfound in them than in the form of any mortal; and that the rule of\\nproportion to which they conformed was ‘higher far than any geometry or\\narithmetic could express?’ (statesman.)\\n\\nagain, plato objects to the imitative arts that they express the\\nemotional rather than the rational part of human nature. he does not\\nadmit aristotle’s theory, that tragedy or other serious imitations are\\na purgation of the passions by pity and fear; to him they appear only\\nto afford the opportunity of indulging them. yet we must acknowledge\\nthat we may sometimes cure disordered emotions by giving expression to\\nthem; and that they often gain strength when pent up within our own\\nbreast. it is not every indulgence of the feelings which is to be\\ncondemned. for there may be a gratification of the higher as well as of\\nthe lower—thoughts which are too deep or too sad to be expressed by\\nourselves, may find an utterance in the words of poets. every one would\\nacknowledge that there have been times when they were consoled and\\nelevated by beautiful music or by the sublimity of architecture or by\\nthe peacefulness of nature. plato has himself admitted, in the earlier\\npart of the republic, that the arts might have the effect of\\nharmonizing as well as of enervating the mind; but in the tenth book he\\nregards them through a stoic or puritan medium. he asks only ‘what good\\nhave they done?’ and is not satisfied with the reply, that ‘they have\\ngiven innocent pleasure to mankind.’\\n\\nhe tells us that he rejoices in the banishment of the poets, since he\\nhas found by the analysis of the soul that they are concerned with the\\ninferior faculties. he means to say that the higher faculties have to\\ndo with universals, the lower with particulars of sense. the poets are\\non a level with their own age, but not on a level with socrates and\\nplato; and he was well aware that homer and hesiod could not be made a\\nrule of life by any process of legitimate interpretation; his ironical\\nuse of them is in fact a denial of their authority; he saw, too, that\\nthe poets were not critics—as he says in the apology, ‘any one was a\\nbetter interpreter of their writings than they were themselves. he\\nhimself ceased to be a poet when he became a disciple of socrates;\\nthough, as he tells us of solon, ‘he might have been one of the\\ngreatest of them, if he had not been deterred by other pursuits’ (tim.)\\nthus from many points of view there is an antagonism between plato and\\nthe poets, which was foreshadowed to him in the old quarrel between\\nphilosophy and poetry. the poets, as he says in the protagoras, were\\nthe sophists of their day; and his dislike of the one class is\\nreflected on the other. he regards them both as the enemies of\\nreasoning and abstraction, though in the case of euripides more with\\nreference to his immoral sentiments about tyrants and the like. for\\nplato is the prophet who ‘came into the world to convince men’—first of\\nthe fallibility of sense and opinion, and secondly of the reality of\\nabstract ideas. whatever strangeness there may be in modern times in\\nopposing philosophy to poetry, which to us seem to have so many\\nelements in common, the strangeness will disappear if we conceive of\\npoetry as allied to sense, and of philosophy as equivalent to thought\\nand abstraction. unfortunately the very word ‘idea,’ which to plato is\\nexpressive of the most real of all things, is associated in our minds\\nwith an element of subjectiveness and unreality. we may note also how\\nhe differs from aristotle who declares poetry to be truer than history,\\nfor the opposite reason, because it is concerned with universals, not\\nlike history, with particulars (poet).\\n\\nthe things which are seen are opposed in scripture to the things which\\nare unseen—they are equally opposed in plato to universals and ideas.\\nto him all particulars appear to be floating about in a world of sense;\\nthey have a taint of error or even of evil. there is no difficulty in\\nseeing that this is an illusion; for there is no more error or\\nvariation in an individual man, horse, bed, etc., than in the class\\nman, horse, bed, etc.; nor is the truth which is displayed in\\nindividual instances less certain than that which is conveyed through\\nthe medium of ideas. but plato, who is deeply impressed with the real\\nimportance of universals as instruments of thought, attributes to them\\nan essential truth which is imaginary and unreal; for universals may be\\noften false and particulars true. had he attained to any clear\\nconception of the individual, which is the synthesis of the universal\\nand the particular; or had he been able to distinguish between opinion\\nand sensation, which the ambiguity of the words (greek) and the like,\\ntended to confuse, he would not have denied truth to the particulars of\\nsense.\\n\\nbut the poets are also the representatives of falsehood and feigning in\\nall departments of life and knowledge, like the sophists and\\nrhetoricians of the gorgias and phaedrus; they are the false priests,\\nfalse prophets, lying spirits, enchanters of the world. there is\\nanother count put into the indictment against them by plato, that they\\nare the friends of the tyrant, and bask in the sunshine of his\\npatronage. despotism in all ages has had an apparatus of false ideas\\nand false teachers at its service—in the history of modern europe as\\nwell as of greece and rome. for no government of men depends solely\\nupon force; without some corruption of literature and morals—some\\nappeal to the imagination of the masses—some pretence to the favour of\\nheaven—some element of good giving power to evil, tyranny, even for a\\nshort time, cannot be maintained. the greek tyrants were not insensible\\nto the importance of awakening in their cause a pseudo-hellenic\\nfeeling; they were proud of successes at the olympic games; they were\\nnot devoid of the love of literature and art. plato is thinking in the\\nfirst instance of greek poets who had graced the courts of dionysius or\\narchelaus: and the old spirit of freedom is roused within him at their\\nprostitution of the tragic muse in the praises of tyranny. but his\\nprophetic eye extends beyond them to the false teachers of other ages\\nwho are the creatures of the government under which they live. he\\ncompares the corruption of his contemporaries with the idea of a\\nperfect society, and gathers up into one mass of evil the evils and\\nerrors of mankind; to him they are personified in the rhetoricians,\\nsophists, poets, rulers who deceive and govern the world.\\n\\na further objection which plato makes to poetry and the imitative arts\\nis that they excite the emotions. here the modern reader will be\\ndisposed to introduce a distinction which appears to have escaped him.\\nfor the emotions are neither bad nor good in themselves, and are not\\nmost likely to be controlled by the attempt to eradicate them, but by\\nthe moderate indulgence of them. and the vocation of art is to present\\nthought in the form of feeling, to enlist the feelings on the side of\\nreason, to inspire even for a moment courage or resignation; perhaps to\\nsuggest a sense of infinity and eternity in a way which mere language\\nis incapable of attaining. true, the same power which in the purer age\\nof art embodies gods and heroes only, may be made to express the\\nvoluptuous image of a corinthian courtezan. but this only shows that\\nart, like other outward things, may be turned to good and also to evil,\\nand is not more closely connected with the higher than with the lower\\npart of the soul. all imitative art is subject to certain limitations,\\nand therefore necessarily partakes of the nature of a compromise.\\nsomething of ideal truth is sacrificed for the sake of the\\nrepresentation, and something in the exactness of the representation is\\nsacrificed to the ideal. still, works of art have a permanent element;\\nthey idealize and detain the passing thought, and are the intermediates\\nbetween sense and ideas.\\n\\nin the present stage of the human mind, poetry and other forms of\\nfiction may certainly be regarded as a good. but we can also imagine\\nthe existence of an age in which a severer conception of truth has\\neither banished or transformed them. at any rate we must admit that\\nthey hold a different place at different periods of the world’s\\nhistory. in the infancy of mankind, poetry, with the exception of\\nproverbs, is the whole of literature, and the only instrument of\\nintellectual culture; in modern times she is the shadow or echo of her\\nformer self, and appears to have a precarious existence. milton in his\\nday doubted whether an epic poem was any longer possible. at the same\\ntime we must remember, that what plato would have called the charms of\\npoetry have been partly transferred to prose; he himself (statesman)\\nadmits rhetoric to be the handmaiden of politics, and proposes to find\\nin the strain of law (laws) a substitute for the old poets. among\\nourselves the creative power seems often to be growing weaker, and\\nscientific fact to be more engrossing and overpowering to the mind than\\nformerly. the illusion of the feelings commonly called love, has\\nhitherto been the inspiring influence of modern poetry and romance, and\\nhas exercised a humanizing if not a strengthening influence on the\\nworld. but may not the stimulus which love has given to fancy be some\\nday exhausted? the modern english novel which is the most popular of\\nall forms of reading is not more than a century or two old: will the\\ntale of love a hundred years hence, after so many thousand variations\\nof the same theme, be still received with unabated interest?\\n\\nart cannot claim to be on a level with philosophy or religion, and may\\noften corrupt them. it is possible to conceive a mental state in which\\nall artistic representations are regarded as a false and imperfect\\nexpression, either of the religious ideal or of the philosophical\\nideal. the fairest forms may be revolting in certain moods of mind, as\\nis proved by the fact that the mahometans, and many sects of\\nchristians, have renounced the use of pictures and images. the\\nbeginning of a great religion, whether christian or gentile, has not\\nbeen ‘wood or stone,’ but a spirit moving in the hearts of men. the\\ndisciples have met in a large upper room or in ‘holes and caves of the\\nearth’; in the second or third generation, they have had mosques,\\ntemples, churches, monasteries. and the revival or reform of religions,\\nlike the first revelation of them, has come from within and has\\ngenerally disregarded external ceremonies and accompaniments.\\n\\nbut poetry and art may also be the expression of the highest truth and\\nthe purest sentiment. plato himself seems to waver between two opposite\\nviews—when, as in the third book, he insists that youth should be\\nbrought up amid wholesome imagery; and again in book x, when he\\nbanishes the poets from his republic. admitting that the arts, which\\nsome of us almost deify, have fallen short of their higher aim, we must\\nadmit on the other hand that to banish imagination wholly would be\\nsuicidal as well as impossible. for nature too is a form of art; and a\\nbreath of the fresh air or a single glance at the varying landscape\\nwould in an instant revive and reillumine the extinguished spark of\\npoetry in the human breast. in the lower stages of civilization\\nimagination more than reason distinguishes man from the animals; and to\\nbanish art would be to banish thought, to banish language, to banish\\nthe expression of all truth. no religion is wholly devoid of external\\nforms; even the mahometan who renounces the use of pictures and images\\nhas a temple in which he worships the most high, as solemn and\\nbeautiful as any greek or christian building. feeling too and thought\\nare not really opposed; for he who thinks must feel before he can\\nexecute. and the highest thoughts, when they become familiarized to us,\\nare always tending to pass into the form of feeling.\\n\\nplato does not seriously intend to expel poets from life and society.\\nbut he feels strongly the unreality of their writings; he is protesting\\nagainst the degeneracy of poetry in his own day as we might protest\\nagainst the want of serious purpose in modern fiction, against the\\nunseemliness or extravagance of some of our poets or novelists, against\\nthe time-serving of preachers or public writers, against the\\nregardlessness of truth which to the eye of the philosopher seems to\\ncharacterize the greater part of the world. for we too have reason to\\ncomplain that our poets and novelists ‘paint inferior truth’ and ‘are\\nconcerned with the inferior part of the soul’; that the readers of them\\nbecome what they read and are injuriously affected by them. and we look\\nin vain for that healthy atmosphere of which plato speaks,—‘the beauty\\nwhich meets the sense like a breeze and imperceptibly draws the soul,\\neven in childhood, into harmony with the beauty of reason.’\\n\\nfor there might be a poetry which would be the hymn of divine\\nperfection, the harmony of goodness and truth among men: a strain which\\nshould renew the youth of the world, and bring back the ages in which\\nthe poet was man’s only teacher and best friend,—which would find\\nmaterials in the living present as well as in the romance of the past,\\nand might subdue to the fairest forms of speech and verse the\\nintractable materials of modern civilisation,—which might elicit the\\nsimple principles, or, as plato would have called them, the essential\\nforms, of truth and justice out of the variety of opinion and the\\ncomplexity of modern society,—which would preserve all the good of each\\ngeneration and leave the bad unsung,—which should be based not on vain\\nlongings or faint imaginings, but on a clear insight into the nature of\\nman. then the tale of love might begin again in poetry or prose, two in\\none, united in the pursuit of knowledge, or the service of god and man;\\nand feelings of love might still be the incentive to great thoughts and\\nheroic deeds as in the days of dante or petrarch; and many types of\\nmanly and womanly beauty might appear among us, rising above the\\nordinary level of humanity, and many lives which were like poems\\n(laws), be not only written, but lived by us. a few such strains have\\nbeen heard among men in the tragedies of aeschylus and sophocles, whom\\nplato quotes, not, as homer is quoted by him, in irony, but with deep\\nand serious approval,—in the poetry of milton and wordsworth, and in\\npassages of other english poets,—first and above all in the hebrew\\nprophets and psalmists. shakespeare has taught us how great men should\\nspeak and act; he has drawn characters of a wonderful purity and depth;\\nhe has ennobled the human mind, but, like homer (rep.), he ‘has left no\\nway of life.’ the next greatest poet of modern times, goethe, is\\nconcerned with ‘a lower degree of truth’; he paints the world as a\\nstage on which ‘all the men and women are merely players’; he\\ncultivates life as an art, but he furnishes no ideals of truth and\\naction. the poet may rebel against any attempt to set limits to his\\nfancy; and he may argue truly that moralizing in verse is not poetry.\\npossibly, like mephistopheles in faust, he may retaliate on his\\nadversaries. but the philosopher will still be justified in asking,\\n‘how may the heavenly gift of poesy be devoted to the good of mankind?’\\n\\nreturning to plato, we may observe that a similar mixture of truth and\\nerror appears in other parts of the argument. he is aware of the\\nabsurdity of mankind framing their whole lives according to homer; just\\nas in the phaedrus he intimates the absurdity of interpreting mythology\\nupon rational principles; both these were the modern tendencies of his\\nown age, which he deservedly ridicules. on the other hand, his argument\\nthat homer, if he had been able to teach mankind anything worth\\nknowing, would not have been allowed by them to go about begging as a\\nrhapsodist, is both false and contrary to the spirit of plato (rep.).\\nit may be compared with those other paradoxes of the gorgias, that ‘no\\nstatesman was ever unjustly put to death by the city of which he was\\nthe head’; and that ‘no sophist was ever defrauded by his pupils’\\n(gorg.)...\\n\\nthe argument for immortality seems to rest on the absolute dualism of\\nsoul and body. admitting the existence of the soul, we know of no force\\nwhich is able to put an end to her. vice is her own proper evil; and if\\nshe cannot be destroyed by that, she cannot be destroyed by any other.\\nyet plato has acknowledged that the soul may be so overgrown by the\\nincrustations of earth as to lose her original form; and in the timaeus\\nhe recognizes more strongly than in the republic the influence which\\nthe body has over the mind, denying even the voluntariness of human\\nactions, on the ground that they proceed from physical states (tim.).\\nin the republic, as elsewhere, he wavers between the original soul\\nwhich has to be restored, and the character which is developed by\\ntraining and education...\\n\\nthe vision of another world is ascribed to er, the son of armenius, who\\nis said by clement of alexandria to have been zoroaster. the tale has\\ncertainly an oriental character, and may be compared with the\\npilgrimages of the soul in the zend avesta (haug, avesta). but no trace\\nof acquaintance with zoroaster is found elsewhere in plato’s writings,\\nand there is no reason for giving him the name of er the pamphylian.\\nthe philosophy of heracleitus cannot be shown to be borrowed from\\nzoroaster, and still less the myths of plato.\\n\\nthe local arrangement of the vision is less distinct than that of the\\nphaedrus and phaedo. astronomy is mingled with symbolism and mythology;\\nthe great sphere of heaven is represented under the symbol of a\\ncylinder or box, containing the seven orbits of the planets and the\\nfixed stars; this is suspended from an axis or spindle which turns on\\nthe knees of necessity; the revolutions of the seven orbits contained\\nin the cylinder are guided by the fates, and their harmonious motion\\nproduces the music of the spheres. through the innermost or eighth of\\nthese, which is the moon, is passed the spindle; but it is doubtful\\nwhether this is the continuation of the column of light, from which the\\npilgrims contemplate the heavens; the words of plato imply that they\\nare connected, but not the same. the column itself is clearly not of\\nadamant. the spindle (which is of adamant) is fastened to the ends of\\nthe chains which extend to the middle of the column of light—this\\ncolumn is said to hold together the heaven; but whether it hangs from\\nthe spindle, or is at right angles to it, is not explained. the\\ncylinder containing the orbits of the stars is almost as much a symbol\\nas the figure of necessity turning the spindle;—for the outermost rim\\nis the sphere of the fixed stars, and nothing is said about the\\nintervals of space which divide the paths of the stars in the heavens.\\nthe description is both a picture and an orrery, and therefore is\\nnecessarily inconsistent with itself. the column of light is not the\\nmilky way—which is neither straight, nor like a rainbow—but the\\nimaginary axis of the earth. this is compared to the rainbow in respect\\nnot of form but of colour, and not to the undergirders of a trireme,\\nbut to the straight rope running from prow to stern in which the\\nundergirders meet.\\n\\nthe orrery or picture of the heavens given in the republic differs in\\nits mode of representation from the circles of the same and of the\\nother in the timaeus. in both the fixed stars are distinguished from\\nthe planets, and they move in orbits without them, although in an\\nopposite direction: in the republic as in the timaeus they are all\\nmoving round the axis of the world. but we are not certain that in the\\nformer they are moving round the earth. no distinct mention is made in\\nthe republic of the circles of the same and other; although both in the\\ntimaeus and in the republic the motion of the fixed stars is supposed\\nto coincide with the motion of the whole. the relative thickness of the\\nrims is perhaps designed to express the relative distances of the\\nplanets. plato probably intended to represent the earth, from which er\\nand his companions are viewing the heavens, as stationary in place; but\\nwhether or not herself revolving, unless this is implied in the\\nrevolution of the axis, is uncertain (timaeus). the spectator may be\\nsupposed to look at the heavenly bodies, either from above or below.\\nthe earth is a sort of earth and heaven in one, like the heaven of the\\nphaedrus, on the back of which the spectator goes out to take a peep at\\nthe stars and is borne round in the revolution. there is no distinction\\nbetween the equator and the ecliptic. but plato is no doubt led to\\nimagine that the planets have an opposite motion to that of the fixed\\nstars, in order to account for their appearances in the heavens. in the\\ndescription of the meadow, and the retribution of the good and evil\\nafter death, there are traces of homer.\\n\\nthe description of the axis as a spindle, and of the heavenly bodies as\\nforming a whole, partly arises out of the attempt to connect the\\nmotions of the heavenly bodies with the mythological image of the web,\\nor weaving of the fates. the giving of the lots, the weaving of them,\\nand the making of them irreversible, which are ascribed to the three\\nfates—lachesis, clotho, atropos, are obviously derived from their\\nnames. the element of chance in human life is indicated by the order of\\nthe lots. but chance, however adverse, may be overcome by the wisdom of\\nman, if he knows how to choose aright; there is a worse enemy to man\\nthan chance; this enemy is himself. he who was moderately fortunate in\\nthe number of the lot—even the very last comer—might have a good life\\nif he chose with wisdom. and as plato does not like to make an\\nassertion which is unproven, he more than confirms this statement a few\\nsentences afterwards by the example of odysseus, who chose last. but\\nthe virtue which is founded on habit is not sufficient to enable a man\\nto choose; he must add to virtue knowledge, if he is to act rightly\\nwhen placed in new circumstances. the routine of good actions and good\\nhabits is an inferior sort of goodness; and, as coleridge says, ‘common\\nsense is intolerable which is not based on metaphysics,’ so plato would\\nhave said, ‘habit is worthless which is not based upon philosophy.’\\n\\nthe freedom of the will to refuse the evil and to choose the good is\\ndistinctly asserted. ‘virtue is free, and as a man honours or\\ndishonours her he will have more or less of her.’ the life of man is\\n‘rounded’ by necessity; there are circumstances prior to birth which\\naffect him (pol.). but within the walls of necessity there is an open\\nspace in which he is his own master, and can study for himself the\\neffects which the variously compounded gifts of nature or fortune have\\nupon the soul, and act accordingly. all men cannot have the first\\nchoice in everything. but the lot of all men is good enough, if they\\nchoose wisely and will live diligently.\\n\\nthe verisimilitude which is given to the pilgrimage of a thousand\\nyears, by the intimation that ardiaeus had lived a thousand years\\nbefore; the coincidence of er coming to life on the twelfth day after\\nhe was supposed to have been dead with the seven days which the\\npilgrims passed in the meadow, and the four days during which they\\njourneyed to the column of light; the precision with which the soul is\\nmentioned who chose the twentieth lot; the passing remarks that there\\nwas no definite character among the souls, and that the souls which had\\nchosen ill blamed any one rather than themselves; or that some of the\\nsouls drank more than was necessary of the waters of forgetfulness,\\nwhile er himself was hindered from drinking; the desire of odysseus to\\nrest at last, unlike the conception of him in dante and tennyson; the\\nfeigned ignorance of how er returned to the body, when the other souls\\nwent shooting like stars to their birth,—add greatly to the probability\\nof the narrative. they are such touches of nature as the art of defoe\\nmight have introduced when he wished to win credibility for marvels and\\napparitions.\\n\\n\\nthere still remain to be considered some points which have been\\nintentionally reserved to the end: (1) the janus-like character of the\\nrepublic, which presents two faces—one an hellenic state, the other a\\nkingdom of philosophers. connected with the latter of the two aspects\\nare (2) the paradoxes of the republic, as they have been termed by\\nmorgenstern: (a) the community of property; (b) of families; (c) the\\nrule of philosophers; (d) the analogy of the individual and the state,\\nwhich, like some other analogies in the republic, is carried too far.\\nwe may then proceed to consider (3) the subject of education as\\nconceived by plato, bringing together in a general view the education\\nof youth and the education of after-life; (4) we may note further some\\nessential differences between ancient and modern politics which are\\nsuggested by the republic; (5) we may compare the politicus and the\\nlaws; (6) we may observe the influence exercised by plato on his\\nimitators; and (7) take occasion to consider the nature and value of\\npolitical, and (8) of religious ideals.\\n\\n1. plato expressly says that he is intending to found an hellenic state\\n(book v). many of his regulations are characteristically spartan; such\\nas the prohibition of gold and silver, the common meals of the men, the\\nmilitary training of the youth, the gymnastic exercises of the women.\\nthe life of sparta was the life of a camp (laws), enforced even more\\nrigidly in time of peace than in war; the citizens of sparta, like\\nplato’s, were forbidden to trade—they were to be soldiers and not\\nshopkeepers. nowhere else in greece was the individual so completely\\nsubjected to the state; the time when he was to marry, the education of\\nhis children, the clothes which he was to wear, the food which he was\\nto eat, were all prescribed by law. some of the best enactments in the\\nrepublic, such as the reverence to be paid to parents and elders, and\\nsome of the worst, such as the exposure of deformed children, are\\nborrowed from the practice of sparta. the encouragement of friendships\\nbetween men and youths, or of men with one another, as affording\\nincentives to bravery, is also spartan; in sparta too a nearer approach\\nwas made than in any other greek state to equality of the sexes, and to\\ncommunity of property; and while there was probably less of\\nlicentiousness in the sense of immorality, the tie of marriage was\\nregarded more lightly than in the rest of greece. the ‘suprema lex’ was\\nthe preservation of the family, and the interest of the state. the\\ncoarse strength of a military government was not favourable to purity\\nand refinement; and the excessive strictness of some regulations seems\\nto have produced a reaction. of all hellenes the spartans were most\\naccessible to bribery; several of the greatest of them might be\\ndescribed in the words of plato as having a ‘fierce secret longing\\nafter gold and silver.’ though not in the strict sense communists, the\\nprinciple of communism was maintained among them in their division of\\nlands, in their common meals, in their slaves, and in the free use of\\none another’s goods. marriage was a public institution: and the women\\nwere educated by the state, and sang and danced in public with the men.\\n\\nmany traditions were preserved at sparta of the severity with which the\\nmagistrates had maintained the primitive rule of music and poetry; as\\nin the republic of plato, the new-fangled poet was to be expelled.\\nhymns to the gods, which are the only kind of music admitted into the\\nideal state, were the only kind which was permitted at sparta. the\\nspartans, though an unpoetical race, were nevertheless lovers of\\npoetry; they had been stirred by the elegiac strains of tyrtaeus, they\\nhad crowded around hippias to hear his recitals of homer; but in this\\nthey resembled the citizens of the timocratic rather than of the ideal\\nstate. the council of elder men also corresponds to the spartan\\ngerousia; and the freedom with which they are permitted to judge about\\nmatters of detail agrees with what we are told of that institution.\\nonce more, the military rule of not spoiling the dead or offering arms\\nat the temples; the moderation in the pursuit of enemies; the\\nimportance attached to the physical well-being of the citizens; the use\\nof warfare for the sake of defence rather than of aggression—are\\nfeatures probably suggested by the spirit and practice of sparta.\\n\\nto the spartan type the ideal state reverts in the first decline; and\\nthe character of the individual timocrat is borrowed from the spartan\\ncitizen. the love of lacedaemon not only affected plato and xenophon,\\nbut was shared by many undistinguished athenians; there they seemed to\\nfind a principle which was wanting in their own democracy. the (greek)\\nof the spartans attracted them, that is to say, not the goodness of\\ntheir laws, but the spirit of order and loyalty which prevailed.\\nfascinated by the idea, citizens of athens would imitate the\\nlacedaemonians in their dress and manners; they were known to the\\ncontemporaries of plato as ‘the persons who had their ears bruised,’\\nlike the roundheads of the commonwealth. the love of another church or\\ncountry when seen at a distance only, the longing for an imaginary\\nsimplicity in civilized times, the fond desire of a past which never\\nhas been, or of a future which never will be,—these are aspirations of\\nthe human mind which are often felt among ourselves. such feelings meet\\nwith a response in the republic of plato.\\n\\nbut there are other features of the platonic republic, as, for example,\\nthe literary and philosophical education, and the grace and beauty of\\nlife, which are the reverse of spartan. plato wishes to give his\\ncitizens a taste of athenian freedom as well as of lacedaemonian\\ndiscipline. his individual genius is purely athenian, although in\\ntheory he is a lover of sparta; and he is something more than either—he\\nhas also a true hellenic feeling. he is desirous of humanizing the wars\\nof hellenes against one another; he acknowledges that the delphian god\\nis the grand hereditary interpreter of all hellas. the spirit of\\nharmony and the dorian mode are to prevail, and the whole state is to\\nhave an external beauty which is the reflex of the harmony within. but\\nhe has not yet found out the truth which he afterwards enunciated in\\nthe laws—that he was a better legislator who made men to be of one\\nmind, than he who trained them for war. the citizens, as in other\\nhellenic states, democratic as well as aristocratic, are really an\\nupper class; for, although no mention is made of slaves, the lower\\nclasses are allowed to fade away into the distance, and are represented\\nin the individual by the passions. plato has no idea either of a social\\nstate in which all classes are harmonized, or of a federation of hellas\\nor the world in which different nations or states have a place. his\\ncity is equipped for war rather than for peace, and this would seem to\\nbe justified by the ordinary condition of hellenic states. the myth of\\nthe earth-born men is an embodiment of the orthodox tradition of\\nhellas, and the allusion to the four ages of the world is also\\nsanctioned by the authority of hesiod and the poets. thus we see that\\nthe republic is partly founded on the ideal of the old greek polis,\\npartly on the actual circumstances of hellas in that age. plato, like\\nthe old painters, retains the traditional form, and like them he has\\nalso a vision of a city in the clouds.\\n\\nthere is yet another thread which is interwoven in the texture of the\\nwork; for the republic is not only a dorian state, but a pythagorean\\nleague. the ‘way of life’ which was connected with the name of\\npythagoras, like the catholic monastic orders, showed the power which\\nthe mind of an individual might exercise over his contemporaries, and\\nmay have naturally suggested to plato the possibility of reviving such\\n‘mediaeval institutions.’ the pythagoreans, like plato, enforced a rule\\nof life and a moral and intellectual training. the influence ascribed\\nto music, which to us seems exaggerated, is also a pythagorean feature;\\nit is not to be regarded as representing the real influence of music in\\nthe greek world. more nearly than any other government of hellas, the\\npythagorean league of three hundred was an aristocracy of virtue. for\\nonce in the history of mankind the philosophy of order or (greek),\\nexpressing and consequently enlisting on its side the combined\\nendeavours of the better part of the people, obtained the management of\\npublic affairs and held possession of it for a considerable time (until\\nabout b.c. 500). probably only in states prepared by dorian\\ninstitutions would such a league have been possible. the rulers, like\\nplato’s (greek), were required to submit to a severe training in order\\nto prepare the way for the education of the other members of the\\ncommunity. long after the dissolution of the order, eminent\\npythagoreans, such as archytas of tarentum, retained their political\\ninfluence over the cities of magna graecia. there was much here that\\nwas suggestive to the kindred spirit of plato, who had doubtless\\nmeditated deeply on the ‘way of life of pythagoras’ (rep.) and his\\nfollowers. slight traces of pythagoreanism are to be found in the\\nmystical number of the state, in the number which expresses the\\ninterval between the king and the tyrant, in the doctrine of\\ntransmigration, in the music of the spheres, as well as in the great\\nthough secondary importance ascribed to mathematics in education.\\n\\nbut as in his philosophy, so also in the form of his state, he goes far\\nbeyond the old pythagoreans. he attempts a task really impossible,\\nwhich is to unite the past of greek history with the future of\\nphilosophy, analogous to that other impossibility, which has often been\\nthe dream of christendom, the attempt to unite the past history of\\neurope with the kingdom of christ. nothing actually existing in the\\nworld at all resembles plato’s ideal state; nor does he himself imagine\\nthat such a state is possible. this he repeats again and again; e.g. in\\nthe republic, or in the laws where, casting a glance back on the\\nrepublic, he admits that the perfect state of communism and philosophy\\nwas impossible in his own age, though still to be retained as a\\npattern. the same doubt is implied in the earnestness with which he\\nargues in the republic that ideals are none the worse because they\\ncannot be realized in fact, and in the chorus of laughter, which like a\\nbreaking wave will, as he anticipates, greet the mention of his\\nproposals; though like other writers of fiction, he uses all his art to\\ngive reality to his inventions. when asked how the ideal polity can\\ncome into being, he answers ironically, ‘when one son of a king becomes\\na philosopher’; he designates the fiction of the earth-born men as ‘a\\nnoble lie’; and when the structure is finally complete, he fairly tells\\nyou that his republic is a vision only, which in some sense may have\\nreality, but not in the vulgar one of a reign of philosophers upon\\nearth. it has been said that plato flies as well as walks, but this\\nfalls short of the truth; for he flies and walks at the same time, and\\nis in the air and on firm ground in successive instants.\\n\\nniebuhr has asked a trifling question, which may be briefly noticed in\\nthis place—was plato a good citizen? if by this is meant, was he loyal\\nto athenian institutions?—he can hardly be said to be the friend of\\ndemocracy: but neither is he the friend of any other existing form of\\ngovernment; all of them he regarded as ‘states of faction’ (laws); none\\nattained to his ideal of a voluntary rule over voluntary subjects,\\nwhich seems indeed more nearly to describe democracy than any other;\\nand the worst of them is tyranny. the truth is, that the question has\\nhardly any meaning when applied to a great philosopher whose writings\\nare not meant for a particular age and country, but for all time and\\nall mankind. the decline of athenian politics was probably the motive\\nwhich led plato to frame an ideal state, and the republic may be\\nregarded as reflecting the departing glory of hellas. as well might we\\ncomplain of st. augustine, whose great work ‘the city of god’\\noriginated in a similar motive, for not being loyal to the roman\\nempire. even a nearer parallel might be afforded by the first\\nchristians, who cannot fairly be charged with being bad citizens\\nbecause, though ‘subject to the higher powers,’ they were looking\\nforward to a city which is in heaven.\\n\\n2. the idea of the perfect state is full of paradox when judged of\\naccording to the ordinary notions of mankind. the paradoxes of one age\\nhave been said to become the commonplaces of the next; but the\\nparadoxes of plato are at least as paradoxical to us as they were to\\nhis contemporaries. the modern world has either sneered at them as\\nabsurd, or denounced them as unnatural and immoral; men have been\\npleased to find in aristotle’s criticisms of them the anticipation of\\ntheir own good sense. the wealthy and cultivated classes have disliked\\nand also dreaded them; they have pointed with satisfaction to the\\nfailure of efforts to realize them in practice. yet since they are the\\nthoughts of one of the greatest of human intelligences, and of one who\\nhad done most to elevate morality and religion, they seem to deserve a\\nbetter treatment at our hands. we may have to address the public, as\\nplato does poetry, and assure them that we mean no harm to existing\\ninstitutions. there are serious errors which have a side of truth and\\nwhich therefore may fairly demand a careful consideration: there are\\ntruths mixed with error of which we may indeed say, ‘the half is better\\nthan the whole.’ yet ‘the half’ may be an important contribution to the\\nstudy of human nature.\\n\\n(a) the first paradox is the community of goods, which is mentioned\\nslightly at the end of the third book, and seemingly, as aristotle\\nobserves, is confined to the guardians; at least no mention is made of\\nthe other classes. but the omission is not of any real significance,\\nand probably arises out of the plan of the work, which prevents the\\nwriter from entering into details.\\n\\naristotle censures the community of property much in the spirit of\\nmodern political economy, as tending to repress industry, and as doing\\naway with the spirit of benevolence. modern writers almost refuse to\\nconsider the subject, which is supposed to have been long ago settled\\nby the common opinion of mankind. but it must be remembered that the\\nsacredness of property is a notion far more fixed in modern than in\\nancient times. the world has grown older, and is therefore more\\nconservative. primitive society offered many examples of land held in\\ncommon, either by a tribe or by a township, and such may probably have\\nbeen the original form of landed tenure. ancient legislators had\\ninvented various modes of dividing and preserving the divisions of land\\namong the citizens; according to aristotle there were nations who held\\nthe land in common and divided the produce, and there were others who\\ndivided the land and stored the produce in common. the evils of debt\\nand the inequality of property were far greater in ancient than in\\nmodern times, and the accidents to which property was subject from war,\\nor revolution, or taxation, or other legislative interference, were\\nalso greater. all these circumstances gave property a less fixed and\\nsacred character. the early christians are believed to have held their\\nproperty in common, and the principle is sanctioned by the words of\\nchrist himself, and has been maintained as a counsel of perfection in\\nalmost all ages of the church. nor have there been wanting instances of\\nmodern enthusiasts who have made a religion of communism; in every age\\nof religious excitement notions like wycliffe’s ‘inheritance of grace’\\nhave tended to prevail. a like spirit, but fiercer and more violent,\\nhas appeared in politics. ‘the preparation of the gospel of peace’ soon\\nbecomes the red flag of republicanism.\\n\\nwe can hardly judge what effect plato’s views would have upon his own\\ncontemporaries; they would perhaps have seemed to them only an\\nexaggeration of the spartan commonwealth. even modern writers would\\nacknowledge that the right of private property is based on expediency,\\nand may be interfered with in a variety of ways for the public good.\\nany other mode of vesting property which was found to be more\\nadvantageous, would in time acquire the same basis of right; ‘the most\\nuseful,’ in plato’s words, ‘would be the most sacred.’ the lawyers and\\necclesiastics of former ages would have spoken of property as a sacred\\ninstitution. but they only meant by such language to oppose the\\ngreatest amount of resistance to any invasion of the rights of\\nindividuals and of the church.\\n\\nwhen we consider the question, without any fear of immediate\\napplication to practice, in the spirit of plato’s republic, are we\\nquite sure that the received notions of property are the best? is the\\ndistribution of wealth which is customary in civilized countries the\\nmost favourable that can be conceived for the education and development\\nof the mass of mankind? can ‘the spectator of all time and all\\nexistence’ be quite convinced that one or two thousand years hence,\\ngreat changes will not have taken place in the rights of property, or\\neven that the very notion of property, beyond what is necessary for\\npersonal maintenance, may not have disappeared? this was a distinction\\nfamiliar to aristotle, though likely to be laughed at among ourselves.\\nsuch a change would not be greater than some other changes through\\nwhich the world has passed in the transition from ancient to modern\\nsociety, for example, the emancipation of the serfs in russia, or the\\nabolition of slavery in america and the west indies; and not so great\\nas the difference which separates the eastern village community from\\nthe western world. to accomplish such a revolution in the course of a\\nfew centuries, would imply a rate of progress not more rapid than has\\nactually taken place during the last fifty or sixty years. the kingdom\\nof japan underwent more change in five or six years than europe in five\\nor six hundred. many opinions and beliefs which have been cherished\\namong ourselves quite as strongly as the sacredness of property have\\npassed away; and the most untenable propositions respecting the right\\nof bequests or entail have been maintained with as much fervour as the\\nmost moderate. some one will be heard to ask whether a state of society\\ncan be final in which the interests of thousands are perilled on the\\nlife or character of a single person. and many will indulge the hope\\nthat our present condition may, after all, be only transitional, and\\nmay conduct to a higher, in which property, besides ministering to the\\nenjoyment of the few, may also furnish the means of the highest culture\\nto all, and will be a greater benefit to the public generally, and also\\nmore under the control of public authority. there may come a time when\\nthe saying, ‘have i not a right to do what i will with my own?’ will\\nappear to be a barbarous relic of individualism;—when the possession of\\na part may be a greater blessing to each and all than the possession of\\nthe whole is now to any one.\\n\\nsuch reflections appear visionary to the eye of the practical\\nstatesman, but they are within the range of possibility to the\\nphilosopher. he can imagine that in some distant age or clime, and\\nthrough the influence of some individual, the notion of common property\\nmay or might have sunk as deep into the heart of a race, and have\\nbecome as fixed to them, as private property is to ourselves. he knows\\nthat this latter institution is not more than four or five thousand\\nyears old: may not the end revert to the beginning? in our own age even\\nutopias affect the spirit of legislation, and an abstract idea may\\nexercise a great influence on practical politics.\\n\\nthe objections that would be generally urged against plato’s community\\nof property, are the old ones of aristotle, that motives for exertion\\nwould be taken away, and that disputes would arise when each was\\ndependent upon all. every man would produce as little and consume as\\nmuch as he liked. the experience of civilized nations has hitherto been\\nadverse to socialism. the effort is too great for human nature; men try\\nto live in common, but the personal feeling is always breaking in. on\\nthe other hand it may be doubted whether our present notions of\\nproperty are not conventional, for they differ in different countries\\nand in different states of society. we boast of an individualism which\\nis not freedom, but rather an artificial result of the industrial state\\nof modern europe. the individual is nominally free, but he is also\\npowerless in a world bound hand and foot in the chains of economic\\nnecessity. even if we cannot expect the mass of mankind to become\\ndisinterested, at any rate we observe in them a power of organization\\nwhich fifty years ago would never have been suspected. the same forces\\nwhich have revolutionized the political system of europe, may effect a\\nsimilar change in the social and industrial relations of mankind. and\\nif we suppose the influence of some good as well as neutral motives\\nworking in the community, there will be no absurdity in expecting that\\nthe mass of mankind having power, and becoming enlightened about the\\nhigher possibilities of human life, when they learn how much more is\\nattainable for all than is at present the possession of a favoured few,\\nmay pursue the common interest with an intelligence and persistency\\nwhich mankind have hitherto never seen.\\n\\nnow that the world has once been set in motion, and is no longer held\\nfast under the tyranny of custom and ignorance; now that criticism has\\npierced the veil of tradition and the past no longer overpowers the\\npresent,—the progress of civilization may be expected to be far greater\\nand swifter than heretofore. even at our present rate of speed the\\npoint at which we may arrive in two or three generations is beyond the\\npower of imagination to foresee. there are forces in the world which\\nwork, not in an arithmetical, but in a geometrical ratio of increase.\\neducation, to use the expression of plato, moves like a wheel with an\\never-multiplying rapidity. nor can we say how great may be its\\ninfluence, when it becomes universal,—when it has been inherited by\\nmany generations,—when it is freed from the trammels of superstition\\nand rightly adapted to the wants and capacities of different classes of\\nmen and women. neither do we know how much more the co-operation of\\nminds or of hands may be capable of accomplishing, whether in labour or\\nin study. the resources of the natural sciences are not half-developed\\nas yet; the soil of the earth, instead of growing more barren, may\\nbecome many times more fertile than hitherto; the uses of machinery far\\ngreater, and also more minute than at present. new secrets of\\nphysiology may be revealed, deeply affecting human nature in its\\ninnermost recesses. the standard of health may be raised and the lives\\nof men prolonged by sanitary and medical knowledge. there may be peace,\\nthere may be leisure, there may be innocent refreshments of many kinds.\\nthe ever-increasing power of locomotion may join the extremes of earth.\\nthere may be mysterious workings of the human mind, such as occur only\\nat great crises of history. the east and the west may meet together,\\nand all nations may contribute their thoughts and their experience to\\nthe common stock of humanity. many other elements enter into a\\nspeculation of this kind. but it is better to make an end of them. for\\nsuch reflections appear to the majority far-fetched, and to men of\\nscience, commonplace.\\n\\n(b) neither to the mind of plato nor of aristotle did the doctrine of\\ncommunity of property present at all the same difficulty, or appear to\\nbe the same violation of the common hellenic sentiment, as the\\ncommunity of wives and children. this paradox he prefaces by another\\nproposal, that the occupations of men and women shall be the same, and\\nthat to this end they shall have a common training and education. male\\nand female animals have the same pursuits—why not also the two sexes of\\nman?\\n\\nbut have we not here fallen into a contradiction? for we were saying\\nthat different natures should have different pursuits. how then can men\\nand women have the same? and is not the proposal inconsistent with our\\nnotion of the division of labour?—these objections are no sooner raised\\nthan answered; for, according to plato, there is no organic difference\\nbetween men and women, but only the accidental one that men beget and\\nwomen bear children. following the analogy of the other animals, he\\ncontends that all natural gifts are scattered about indifferently among\\nboth sexes, though there may be a superiority of degree on the part of\\nthe men. the objection on the score of decency to their taking part in\\nthe same gymnastic exercises, is met by plato’s assertion that the\\nexisting feeling is a matter of habit.\\n\\nthat plato should have emancipated himself from the ideas of his own\\ncountry and from the example of the east, shows a wonderful\\nindependence of mind. he is conscious that women are half the human\\nrace, in some respects the more important half (laws); and for the sake\\nboth of men and women he desires to raise the woman to a higher level\\nof existence. he brings, not sentiment, but philosophy to bear upon a\\nquestion which both in ancient and modern times has been chiefly\\nregarded in the light of custom or feeling. the greeks had noble\\nconceptions of womanhood in the goddesses athene and artemis, and in\\nthe heroines antigone and andromache. but these ideals had no\\ncounterpart in actual life. the athenian woman was in no way the equal\\nof her husband; she was not the entertainer of his guests or the\\nmistress of his house, but only his housekeeper and the mother of his\\nchildren. she took no part in military or political matters; nor is\\nthere any instance in the later ages of greece of a woman becoming\\nfamous in literature. ‘hers is the greatest glory who has the least\\nrenown among men,’ is the historian’s conception of feminine\\nexcellence. a very different ideal of womanhood is held up by plato to\\nthe world; she is to be the companion of the man, and to share with him\\nin the toils of war and in the cares of government. she is to be\\nsimilarly trained both in bodily and mental exercises. she is to lose\\nas far as possible the incidents of maternity and the characteristics\\nof the female sex.\\n\\nthe modern antagonist of the equality of the sexes would argue that the\\ndifferences between men and women are not confined to the single point\\nurged by plato; that sensibility, gentleness, grace, are the qualities\\nof women, while energy, strength, higher intelligence, are to be looked\\nfor in men. and the criticism is just: the differences affect the whole\\nnature, and are not, as plato supposes, confined to a single point. but\\nneither can we say how far these differences are due to education and\\nthe opinions of mankind, or physically inherited from the habits and\\nopinions of former generations. women have been always taught, not\\nexactly that they are slaves, but that they are in an inferior\\nposition, which is also supposed to have compensating advantages; and\\nto this position they have conformed. it is also true that the physical\\nform may easily change in the course of generations through the mode of\\nlife; and the weakness or delicacy, which was once a matter of opinion,\\nmay become a physical fact. the characteristics of sex vary greatly in\\ndifferent countries and ranks of society, and at different ages in the\\nsame individuals. plato may have been right in denying that there was\\nany ultimate difference in the sexes of man other than that which\\nexists in animals, because all other differences may be conceived to\\ndisappear in other states of society, or under different circumstances\\nof life and training.\\n\\nthe first wave having been passed, we proceed to the second—community\\nof wives and children. ‘is it possible? is it desirable?’ for as\\nglaucon intimates, and as we far more strongly insist, ‘great doubts\\nmay be entertained about both these points.’ any free discussion of the\\nquestion is impossible, and mankind are perhaps right in not allowing\\nthe ultimate bases of social life to be examined. few of us can safely\\nenquire into the things which nature hides, any more than we can\\ndissect our own bodies. still, the manner in which plato arrived at his\\nconclusions should be considered. for here, as mr. grote has remarked,\\nis a wonderful thing, that one of the wisest and best of men should\\nhave entertained ideas of morality which are wholly at variance with\\nour own. and if we would do plato justice, we must examine carefully\\nthe character of his proposals. first, we may observe that the\\nrelations of the sexes supposed by him are the reverse of licentious:\\nhe seems rather to aim at an impossible strictness. secondly, he\\nconceives the family to be the natural enemy of the state; and he\\nentertains the serious hope that an universal brotherhood may take the\\nplace of private interests—an aspiration which, although not justified\\nby experience, has possessed many noble minds. on the other hand, there\\nis no sentiment or imagination in the connections which men and women\\nare supposed by him to form; human beings return to the level of the\\nanimals, neither exalting to heaven, nor yet abusing the natural\\ninstincts. all that world of poetry and fancy which the passion of love\\nhas called forth in modern literature and romance would have been\\nbanished by plato. the arrangements of marriage in the republic are\\ndirected to one object—the improvement of the race. in successive\\ngenerations a great development both of bodily and mental qualities\\nmight be possible. the analogy of animals tends to show that mankind\\ncan within certain limits receive a change of nature. and as in animals\\nwe should commonly choose the best for breeding, and destroy the\\nothers, so there must be a selection made of the human beings whose\\nlives are worthy to be preserved.\\n\\nwe start back horrified from this platonic ideal, in the belief, first,\\nthat the higher feelings of humanity are far too strong to be crushed\\nout; secondly, that if the plan could be carried into execution we\\nshould be poorly recompensed by improvements in the breed for the loss\\nof the best things in life. the greatest regard for the weakest and\\nmeanest of human beings—the infant, the criminal, the insane, the\\nidiot, truly seems to us one of the noblest results of christianity. we\\nhave learned, though as yet imperfectly, that the individual man has an\\nendless value in the sight of god, and that we honour him when we\\nhonour the darkened and disfigured image of him (laws). this is the\\nlesson which christ taught in a parable when he said, ‘their angels do\\nalways behold the face of my father which is in heaven.’ such lessons\\nare only partially realized in any age; they were foreign to the age of\\nplato, as they have very different degrees of strength in different\\ncountries or ages of the christian world. to the greek the family was a\\nreligious and customary institution binding the members together by a\\ntie inferior in strength to that of friendship, and having a less\\nsolemn and sacred sound than that of country. the relationship which\\nexisted on the lower level of custom, plato imagined that he was\\nraising to the higher level of nature and reason; while from the modern\\nand christian point of view we regard him as sanctioning murder and\\ndestroying the first principles of morality.\\n\\nthe great error in these and similar speculations is that the\\ndifference between man and the animals is forgotten in them. the human\\nbeing is regarded with the eye of a dog- or bird-fancier, or at best of\\na slave-owner; the higher or human qualities are left out. the breeder\\nof animals aims chiefly at size or speed or strength; in a few cases at\\ncourage or temper; most often the fitness of the animal for food is the\\ngreat desideratum. but mankind are not bred to be eaten, nor yet for\\ntheir superiority in fighting or in running or in drawing carts.\\nneither does the improvement of the human race consist merely in the\\nincrease of the bones and flesh, but in the growth and enlightenment of\\nthe mind. hence there must be ‘a marriage of true minds’ as well as of\\nbodies, of imagination and reason as well as of lusts and instincts.\\nmen and women without feeling or imagination are justly called brutes;\\nyet plato takes away these qualities and puts nothing in their place,\\nnot even the desire of a noble offspring, since parents are not to know\\ntheir own children. the most important transaction of social life, he\\nwho is the idealist philosopher converts into the most brutal. for the\\npair are to have no relation to one another, except at the hymeneal\\nfestival; their children are not theirs, but the state’s; nor is any\\ntie of affection to unite them. yet here the analogy of the animals\\nmight have saved plato from a gigantic error, if he had ‘not lost sight\\nof his own illustration.’ for the ‘nobler sort of birds and beasts’\\nnourish and protect their offspring and are faithful to one another.\\n\\nan eminent physiologist thinks it worth while ‘to try and place life on\\na physical basis.’ but should not life rest on the moral rather than\\nupon the physical? the higher comes first, then the lower, first the\\nhuman and rational, afterwards the animal. yet they are not absolutely\\ndivided; and in times of sickness or moments of self-indulgence they\\nseem to be only different aspects of a common human nature which\\nincludes them both. neither is the moral the limit of the physical, but\\nthe expansion and enlargement of it,—the highest form which the\\nphysical is capable of receiving. as plato would say, the body does not\\ntake care of the body, and still less of the mind, but the mind takes\\ncare of both. in all human action not that which is common to man and\\nthe animals is the characteristic element, but that which distinguishes\\nhim from them. even if we admit the physical basis, and resolve all\\nvirtue into health of body ‘la facon que notre sang circule,’ still on\\nmerely physical grounds we must come back to ideas. mind and reason and\\nduty and conscience, under these or other names, are always\\nreappearing. there cannot be health of body without health of mind; nor\\nhealth of mind without the sense of duty and the love of truth (charm).\\n\\nthat the greatest of ancient philosophers should in his regulations\\nabout marriage have fallen into the error of separating body and mind,\\ndoes indeed appear surprising. yet the wonder is not so much that plato\\nshould have entertained ideas of morality which to our own age are\\nrevolting, but that he should have contradicted himself to an extent\\nwhich is hardly credible, falling in an instant from the heaven of\\nidealism into the crudest animalism. rejoicing in the newly found gift\\nof reflection, he appears to have thought out a subject about which he\\nhad better have followed the enlightened feeling of his own age. the\\ngeneral sentiment of hellas was opposed to his monstrous fancy. the old\\npoets, and in later time the tragedians, showed no want of respect for\\nthe family, on which much of their religion was based. but the example\\nof sparta, and perhaps in some degree the tendency to defy public\\nopinion, seems to have misled him. he will make one family out of all\\nthe families of the state. he will select the finest specimens of men\\nand women and breed from these only.\\n\\nyet because the illusion is always returning (for the animal part of\\nhuman nature will from time to time assert itself in the disguise of\\nphilosophy as well as of poetry), and also because any departure from\\nestablished morality, even where this is not intended, is apt to be\\nunsettling, it may be worth while to draw out a little more at length\\nthe objections to the platonic marriage. in the first place, history\\nshows that wherever polygamy has been largely allowed the race has\\ndeteriorated. one man to one woman is the law of god and nature. nearly\\nall the civilized peoples of the world at some period before the age of\\nwritten records, have become monogamists; and the step when once taken\\nhas never been retraced. the exceptions occurring among brahmins or\\nmahometans or the ancient persians, are of that sort which may be said\\nto prove the rule. the connexions formed between superior and inferior\\nraces hardly ever produce a noble offspring, because they are\\nlicentious; and because the children in such cases usually despise the\\nmother and are neglected by the father who is ashamed of them.\\nbarbarous nations when they are introduced by europeans to vice die\\nout; polygamist peoples either import and adopt children from other\\ncountries, or dwindle in numbers, or both. dynasties and aristocracies\\nwhich have disregarded the laws of nature have decreased in numbers and\\ndegenerated in stature; ‘mariages de convenance’ leave their enfeebling\\nstamp on the offspring of them (king lear). the marriage of near\\nrelations, or the marrying in and in of the same family tends\\nconstantly to weakness or idiocy in the children, sometimes assuming\\nthe form as they grow older of passionate licentiousness. the common\\nprostitute rarely has any offspring. by such unmistakable evidence is\\nthe authority of morality asserted in the relations of the sexes: and\\nso many more elements enter into this ‘mystery’ than are dreamed of by\\nplato and some other philosophers.\\n\\nrecent enquirers have indeed arrived at the conclusion that among\\nprimitive tribes there existed a community of wives as of property, and\\nthat the captive taken by the spear was the only wife or slave whom any\\nman was permitted to call his own. the partial existence of such\\ncustoms among some of the lower races of man, and the survival of\\npeculiar ceremonies in the marriages of some civilized nations, are\\nthought to furnish a proof of similar institutions having been once\\nuniversal. there can be no question that the study of anthropology has\\nconsiderably changed our views respecting the first appearance of man\\nupon the earth. we know more about the aborigines of the world than\\nformerly, but our increasing knowledge shows above all things how\\nlittle we know. with all the helps which written monuments afford, we\\ndo but faintly realize the condition of man two thousand or three\\nthousand years ago. of what his condition was when removed to a\\ndistance 200,000 or 300,000 years, when the majority of mankind were\\nlower and nearer the animals than any tribe now existing upon the\\nearth, we cannot even entertain conjecture. plato (laws) and aristotle\\n(metaph.) may have been more right than we imagine in supposing that\\nsome forms of civilisation were discovered and lost several times over.\\nif we cannot argue that all barbarism is a degraded civilization,\\nneither can we set any limits to the depth of degradation to which the\\nhuman race may sink through war, disease, or isolation. and if we are\\nto draw inferences about the origin of marriage from the practice of\\nbarbarous nations, we should also consider the remoter analogy of the\\nanimals. many birds and animals, especially the carnivorous, have only\\none mate, and the love and care of offspring which seems to be natural\\nis inconsistent with the primitive theory of marriage. if we go back to\\nan imaginary state in which men were almost animals and the companions\\nof them, we have as much right to argue from what is animal to what is\\nhuman as from the barbarous to the civilized man. the record of animal\\nlife on the globe is fragmentary,—the connecting links are wanting and\\ncannot be supplied; the record of social life is still more fragmentary\\nand precarious. even if we admit that our first ancestors had no such\\ninstitution as marriage, still the stages by which men passed from\\nouter barbarism to the comparative civilization of china, assyria, and\\ngreece, or even of the ancient germans, are wholly unknown to us.\\n\\nsuch speculations are apt to be unsettling, because they seem to show\\nthat an institution which was thought to be a revelation from heaven,\\nis only the growth of history and experience. we ask what is the origin\\nof marriage, and we are told that like the right of property, after\\nmany wars and contests, it has gradually arisen out of the selfishness\\nof barbarians. we stand face to face with human nature in its primitive\\nnakedness. we are compelled to accept, not the highest, but the lowest\\naccount of the origin of human society. but on the other hand we may\\ntruly say that every step in human progress has been in the same\\ndirection, and that in the course of ages the idea of marriage and of\\nthe family has been more and more defined and consecrated. the\\ncivilized east is immeasurably in advance of any savage tribes; the\\ngreeks and romans have improved upon the east; the christian nations\\nhave been stricter in their views of the marriage relation than any of\\nthe ancients. in this as in so many other things, instead of looking\\nback with regret to the past, we should look forward with hope to the\\nfuture. we must consecrate that which we believe to be the most holy,\\nand that ‘which is the most holy will be the most useful.’ there is\\nmore reason for maintaining the sacredness of the marriage tie, when we\\nsee the benefit of it, than when we only felt a vague religious horror\\nabout the violation of it. but in all times of transition, when\\nestablished beliefs are being undermined, there is a danger that in the\\npassage from the old to the new we may insensibly let go the moral\\nprinciple, finding an excuse for listening to the voice of passion in\\nthe uncertainty of knowledge, or the fluctuations of opinion. and there\\nare many persons in our own day who, enlightened by the study of\\nanthropology, and fascinated by what is new and strange, some using the\\nlanguage of fear, others of hope, are inclined to believe that a time\\nwill come when through the self-assertion of women, or the rebellious\\nspirit of children, by the analysis of human relations, or by the force\\nof outward circumstances, the ties of family life may be broken or\\ngreatly relaxed. they point to societies in america and elsewhere which\\ntend to show that the destruction of the family need not necessarily\\ninvolve the overthrow of all morality. wherever we may think of such\\nspeculations, we can hardly deny that they have been more rife in this\\ngeneration than in any other; and whither they are tending, who can\\npredict?\\n\\nto the doubts and queries raised by these ‘social reformers’ respecting\\nthe relation of the sexes and the moral nature of man, there is a\\nsufficient answer, if any is needed. the difference about them and us\\nis really one of fact. they are speaking of man as they wish or fancy\\nhim to be, but we are speaking of him as he is. they isolate the animal\\npart of his nature; we regard him as a creature having many sides, or\\naspects, moving between good and evil, striving to rise above himself\\nand to become ‘a little lower than the angels.’ we also, to use a\\nplatonic formula, are not ignorant of the dissatisfactions and\\nincompatibilities of family life, of the meannesses of trade, of the\\nflatteries of one class of society by another, of the impediments which\\nthe family throws in the way of lofty aims and aspirations. but we are\\nconscious that there are evils and dangers in the background greater\\nstill, which are not appreciated, because they are either concealed or\\nsuppressed. what a condition of man would that be, in which human\\npassions were controlled by no authority, divine or human, in which\\nthere was no shame or decency, no higher affection overcoming or\\nsanctifying the natural instincts, but simply a rule of health! is it\\nfor this that we are asked to throw away the civilization which is the\\ngrowth of ages?\\n\\nfor strength and health are not the only qualities to be desired; there\\nare the more important considerations of mind and character and soul.\\nwe know how human nature may be degraded; we do not know how by\\nartificial means any improvement in the breed can be effected. the\\nproblem is a complex one, for if we go back only four steps (and these\\nat least enter into the composition of a child), there are commonly\\nthirty progenitors to be taken into account. many curious facts, rarely\\nadmitting of proof, are told us respecting the inheritance of disease\\nor character from a remote ancestor. we can trace the physical\\nresemblances of parents and children in the same family—\\n\\n‘sic oculos, sic ille manus, sic ora ferebat’;\\n\\nbut scarcely less often the differences which distinguish children both\\nfrom their parents and from one another. we are told of similar mental\\npeculiarities running in families, and again of a tendency, as in the\\nanimals, to revert to a common or original stock. but we have a\\ndifficulty in distinguishing what is a true inheritance of genius or\\nother qualities, and what is mere imitation or the result of similar\\ncircumstances. great men and great women have rarely had great fathers\\nand mothers. nothing that we know of in the circumstances of their\\nbirth or lineage will explain their appearance. of the english poets of\\nthe last and two preceding centuries scarcely a descendant\\nremains,—none have ever been distinguished. so deeply has nature hidden\\nher secret, and so ridiculous is the fancy which has been entertained\\nby some that we might in time by suitable marriage arrangements or, as\\nplato would have said, ‘by an ingenious system of lots,’ produce a\\nshakespeare or a milton. even supposing that we could breed men having\\nthe tenacity of bulldogs, or, like the spartans, ‘lacking the wit to\\nrun away in battle,’ would the world be any the better? many of the\\nnoblest specimens of the human race have been among the weakest\\nphysically. tyrtaeus or aesop, or our own newton, would have been\\nexposed at sparta; and some of the fairest and strongest men and women\\nhave been among the wickedest and worst. not by the platonic device of\\nuniting the strong and fair with the strong and fair, regardless of\\nsentiment and morality, nor yet by his other device of combining\\ndissimilar natures (statesman), have mankind gradually passed from the\\nbrutality and licentiousness of primitive marriage to marriage\\nchristian and civilized.\\n\\nfew persons would deny that we bring into the world an inheritance of\\nmental and physical qualities derived first from our parents, or\\nthrough them from some remoter ancestor, secondly from our race,\\nthirdly from the general condition of mankind into which we are born.\\nnothing is commoner than the remark, that ‘so and so is like his father\\nor his uncle’; and an aged person may not unfrequently note a\\nresemblance in a youth to a long-forgotten ancestor, observing that\\n‘nature sometimes skips a generation.’ it may be true also, that if we\\nknew more about our ancestors, these similarities would be even more\\nstriking to us. admitting the facts which are thus described in a\\npopular way, we may however remark that there is no method of\\ndifference by which they can be defined or estimated, and that they\\nconstitute only a small part of each individual. the doctrine of\\nheredity may seem to take out of our hands the conduct of our own\\nlives, but it is the idea, not the fact, which is really terrible to\\nus. for what we have received from our ancestors is only a fraction of\\nwhat we are, or may become. the knowledge that drunkenness or insanity\\nhas been prevalent in a family may be the best safeguard against their\\nrecurrence in a future generation. the parent will be most awake to the\\nvices or diseases in his child of which he is most sensible within\\nhimself. the whole of life may be directed to their prevention or cure.\\nthe traces of consumption may become fainter, or be wholly effaced: the\\ninherent tendency to vice or crime may be eradicated. and so heredity,\\nfrom being a curse, may become a blessing. we acknowledge that in the\\nmatter of our birth, as in our nature generally, there are previous\\ncircumstances which affect us. but upon this platform of circumstances\\nor within this wall of necessity, we have still the power of creating a\\nlife for ourselves by the informing energy of the human will.\\n\\nthere is another aspect of the marriage question to which plato is a\\nstranger. all the children born in his state are foundlings. it never\\noccurred to him that the greater part of them, according to universal\\nexperience, would have perished. for children can only be brought up in\\nfamilies. there is a subtle sympathy between the mother and the child\\nwhich cannot be supplied by other mothers, or by ‘strong nurses one or\\nmore’ (laws). if plato’s ‘pen’ was as fatal as the creches of paris, or\\nthe foundling hospital of dublin, more than nine-tenths of his children\\nwould have perished. there would have been no need to expose or put out\\nof the way the weaklier children, for they would have died of\\nthemselves. so emphatically does nature protest against the destruction\\nof the family.\\n\\nwhat plato had heard or seen of sparta was applied by him in a mistaken\\nway to his ideal commonwealth. he probably observed that both the\\nspartan men and women were superior in form and strength to the other\\ngreeks; and this superiority he was disposed to attribute to the laws\\nand customs relating to marriage. he did not consider that the desire\\nof a noble offspring was a passion among the spartans, or that their\\nphysical superiority was to be attributed chiefly, not to their\\nmarriage customs, but to their temperance and training. he did not\\nreflect that sparta was great, not in consequence of the relaxation of\\nmorality, but in spite of it, by virtue of a political principle\\nstronger far than existed in any other grecian state. least of all did\\nhe observe that sparta did not really produce the finest specimens of\\nthe greek race. the genius, the political inspiration of athens, the\\nlove of liberty—all that has made greece famous with posterity, were\\nwanting among the spartans. they had no themistocles, or pericles, or\\naeschylus, or sophocles, or socrates, or plato. the individual was not\\nallowed to appear above the state; the laws were fixed, and he had no\\nbusiness to alter or reform them. yet whence has the progress of cities\\nand nations arisen, if not from remarkable individuals, coming into the\\nworld we know not how, and from causes over which we have no control?\\nsomething too much may have been said in modern times of the value of\\nindividuality. but we can hardly condemn too strongly a system which,\\ninstead of fostering the scattered seeds or sparks of genius and\\ncharacter, tends to smother and extinguish them.\\n\\nstill, while condemning plato, we must acknowledge that neither\\nchristianity, nor any other form of religion and society, has hitherto\\nbeen able to cope with this most difficult of social problems, and that\\nthe side from which plato regarded it is that from which we turn away.\\npopulation is the most untameable force in the political and social\\nworld. do we not find, especially in large cities, that the greatest\\nhindrance to the amelioration of the poor is their improvidence in\\nmarriage?—a small fault truly, if not involving endless consequences.\\nthere are whole countries too, such as india, or, nearer home, ireland,\\nin which a right solution of the marriage question seems to lie at the\\nfoundation of the happiness of the community. there are too many people\\non a given space, or they marry too early and bring into the world a\\nsickly and half-developed offspring; or owing to the very conditions of\\ntheir existence, they become emaciated and hand on a similar life to\\ntheir descendants. but who can oppose the voice of prudence to the\\n‘mightiest passions of mankind’ (laws), especially when they have been\\nlicensed by custom and religion? in addition to the influences of\\neducation, we seem to require some new principles of right and wrong in\\nthese matters, some force of opinion, which may indeed be already heard\\nwhispering in private, but has never affected the moral sentiments of\\nmankind in general. we unavoidably lose sight of the principle of\\nutility, just in that action of our lives in which we have the most\\nneed of it. the influences which we can bring to bear upon this\\nquestion are chiefly indirect. in a generation or two, education,\\nemigration, improvements in agriculture and manufactures, may have\\nprovided the solution. the state physician hardly likes to probe the\\nwound: it is beyond his art; a matter which he cannot safely let alone,\\nbut which he dare not touch:\\n\\n‘we do but skin and film the ulcerous place.’\\n\\nwhen again in private life we see a whole family one by one dropping\\ninto the grave under the ate of some inherited malady, and the parents\\nperhaps surviving them, do our minds ever go back silently to that day\\ntwenty-five or thirty years before on which under the fairest auspices,\\namid the rejoicings of friends and acquaintances, a bride and\\nbridegroom joined hands with one another? in making such a reflection\\nwe are not opposing physical considerations to moral, but moral to\\nphysical; we are seeking to make the voice of reason heard, which\\ndrives us back from the extravagance of sentimentalism on common sense.\\nthe late dr. combe is said by his biographer to have resisted the\\ntemptation to marriage, because he knew that he was subject to\\nhereditary consumption. one who deserved to be called a man of genius,\\na friend of my youth, was in the habit of wearing a black ribbon on his\\nwrist, in order to remind him that, being liable to outbreaks of\\ninsanity, he must not give way to the natural impulses of affection: he\\ndied unmarried in a lunatic asylum. these two little facts suggest the\\nreflection that a very few persons have done from a sense of duty what\\nthe rest of mankind ought to have done under like circumstances, if\\nthey had allowed themselves to think of all the misery which they were\\nabout to bring into the world. if we could prevent such marriages\\nwithout any violation of feeling or propriety, we clearly ought; and\\nthe prohibition in the course of time would be protected by a ‘horror\\nnaturalis’ similar to that which, in all civilized ages and countries,\\nhas prevented the marriage of near relations by blood. mankind would\\nhave been the happier, if some things which are now allowed had from\\nthe beginning been denied to them; if the sanction of religion could\\nhave prohibited practices inimical to health; if sanitary principles\\ncould in early ages have been invested with a superstitious awe. but,\\nliving as we do far on in the world’s history, we are no longer able to\\nstamp at once with the impress of religion a new prohibition. a free\\nagent cannot have his fancies regulated by law; and the execution of\\nthe law would be rendered impossible, owing to the uncertainty of the\\ncases in which marriage was to be forbidden. who can weigh virtue, or\\neven fortune against health, or moral and mental qualities against\\nbodily? who can measure probabilities against certainties? there has\\nbeen some good as well as evil in the discipline of suffering; and\\nthere are diseases, such as consumption, which have exercised a\\nrefining and softening influence on the character. youth is too\\ninexperienced to balance such nice considerations; parents do not often\\nthink of them, or think of them too late. they are at a distance and\\nmay probably be averted; change of place, a new state of life, the\\ninterests of a home may be the cure of them. so persons vainly reason\\nwhen their minds are already made up and their fortunes irrevocably\\nlinked together. nor is there any ground for supposing that marriages\\nare to any great extent influenced by reflections of this sort, which\\nseem unable to make any head against the irresistible impulse of\\nindividual attachment.\\n\\nlastly, no one can have observed the first rising flood of the passions\\nin youth, the difficulty of regulating them, and the effects on the\\nwhole mind and nature which follow from them, the stimulus which is\\ngiven to them by the imagination, without feeling that there is\\nsomething unsatisfactory in our method of treating them. that the most\\nimportant influence on human life should be wholly left to chance or\\nshrouded in mystery, and instead of being disciplined or understood,\\nshould be required to conform only to an external standard of\\npropriety—cannot be regarded by the philosopher as a safe or\\nsatisfactory condition of human things. and still those who have the\\ncharge of youth may find a way by watchfulness, by affection, by the\\nmanliness and innocence of their own lives, by occasional hints, by\\ngeneral admonitions which every one can apply for himself, to mitigate\\nthis terrible evil which eats out the heart of individuals and corrupts\\nthe moral sentiments of nations. in no duty towards others is there\\nmore need of reticence and self-restraint. so great is the danger lest\\nhe who would be the counsellor of another should reveal the secret\\nprematurely, lest he should get another too much into his power; or fix\\nthe passing impression of evil by demanding the confession of it.\\n\\nnor is plato wrong in asserting that family attachments may interfere\\nwith higher aims. if there have been some who ‘to party gave up what\\nwas meant for mankind,’ there have certainly been others who to family\\ngave up what was meant for mankind or for their country. the cares of\\nchildren, the necessity of procuring money for their support, the\\nflatteries of the rich by the poor, the exclusiveness of caste, the\\npride of birth or wealth, the tendency of family life to divert men\\nfrom the pursuit of the ideal or the heroic, are as lowering in our own\\nage as in that of plato. and if we prefer to look at the gentle\\ninfluences of home, the development of the affections, the amenities of\\nsociety, the devotion of one member of a family for the good of the\\nothers, which form one side of the picture, we must not quarrel with\\nhim, or perhaps ought rather to be grateful to him, for having\\npresented to us the reverse. without attempting to defend plato on\\ngrounds of morality, we may allow that there is an aspect of the world\\nwhich has not unnaturally led him into error.\\n\\nwe hardly appreciate the power which the idea of the state, like all\\nother abstract ideas, exercised over the mind of plato. to us the state\\nseems to be built up out of the family, or sometimes to be the\\nframework in which family and social life is contained. but to plato in\\nhis present mood of mind the family is only a disturbing influence\\nwhich, instead of filling up, tends to disarrange the higher unity of\\nthe state. no organization is needed except a political, which,\\nregarded from another point of view, is a military one. the state is\\nall-sufficing for the wants of man, and, like the idea of the church in\\nlater ages, absorbs all other desires and affections. in time of war\\nthe thousand citizens are to stand like a rampart impregnable against\\nthe world or the persian host; in time of peace the preparation for war\\nand their duties to the state, which are also their duties to one\\nanother, take up their whole life and time. the only other interest\\nwhich is allowed to them besides that of war, is the interest of\\nphilosophy. when they are too old to be soldiers they are to retire\\nfrom active life and to have a second novitiate of study and\\ncontemplation. there is an element of monasticism even in plato’s\\ncommunism. if he could have done without children, he might have\\nconverted his republic into a religious order. neither in the laws,\\nwhen the daylight of common sense breaks in upon him, does he retract\\nhis error. in the state of which he would be the founder, there is no\\nmarrying or giving in marriage: but because of the infirmity of\\nmankind, he condescends to allow the law of nature to prevail.\\n\\n(c) but plato has an equal, or, in his own estimation, even greater\\nparadox in reserve, which is summed up in the famous text, ‘until kings\\nare philosophers or philosophers are kings, cities will never cease\\nfrom ill.’ and by philosophers he explains himself to mean those who\\nare capable of apprehending ideas, especially the idea of good. to the\\nattainment of this higher knowledge the second education is directed.\\nthrough a process of training which has already made them good citizens\\nthey are now to be made good legislators. we find with some surprise\\n(not unlike the feeling which aristotle in a well-known passage\\ndescribes the hearers of plato’s lectures as experiencing, when they\\nwent to a discourse on the idea of good, expecting to be instructed in\\nmoral truths, and received instead of them arithmetical and\\nmathematical formulae) that plato does not propose for his future\\nlegislators any study of finance or law or military tactics, but only\\nof abstract mathematics, as a preparation for the still more abstract\\nconception of good. we ask, with aristotle, what is the use of a man\\nknowing the idea of good, if he does not know what is good for this\\nindividual, this state, this condition of society? we cannot understand\\nhow plato’s legislators or guardians are to be fitted for their work of\\nstatesmen by the study of the five mathematical sciences. we vainly\\nsearch in plato’s own writings for any explanation of this seeming\\nabsurdity.\\n\\nthe discovery of a great metaphysical conception seems to ravish the\\nmind with a prophetic consciousness which takes away the power of\\nestimating its value. no metaphysical enquirer has ever fairly\\ncriticised his own speculations; in his own judgment they have been\\nabove criticism; nor has he understood that what to him seemed to be\\nabsolute truth may reappear in the next generation as a form of logic\\nor an instrument of thought. and posterity have also sometimes equally\\nmisapprehended the real value of his speculations. they appear to them\\nto have contributed nothing to the stock of human knowledge. the idea\\nof good is apt to be regarded by the modern thinker as an unmeaning\\nabstraction; but he forgets that this abstraction is waiting ready for\\nuse, and will hereafter be filled up by the divisions of knowledge.\\nwhen mankind do not as yet know that the world is subject to law, the\\nintroduction of the mere conception of law or design or final cause,\\nand the far-off anticipation of the harmony of knowledge, are great\\nsteps onward. even the crude generalization of the unity of all things\\nleads men to view the world with different eyes, and may easily affect\\ntheir conception of human life and of politics, and also their own\\nconduct and character (tim). we can imagine how a great mind like that\\nof pericles might derive elevation from his intercourse with anaxagoras\\n(phaedr.). to be struggling towards a higher but unattainable\\nconception is a more favourable intellectual condition than to rest\\nsatisfied in a narrow portion of ascertained fact. and the earlier,\\nwhich have sometimes been the greater ideas of science, are often lost\\nsight of at a later period. how rarely can we say of any modern\\nenquirer in the magnificent language of plato, that ‘he is the\\nspectator of all time and of all existence!’\\n\\nnor is there anything unnatural in the hasty application of these vast\\nmetaphysical conceptions to practical and political life. in the first\\nenthusiasm of ideas men are apt to see them everywhere, and to apply\\nthem in the most remote sphere. they do not understand that the\\nexperience of ages is required to enable them to fill up ‘the\\nintermediate axioms.’ plato himself seems to have imagined that the\\ntruths of psychology, like those of astronomy and harmonics, would be\\narrived at by a process of deduction, and that the method which he has\\npursued in the fourth book, of inferring them from experience and the\\nuse of language, was imperfect and only provisional. but when, after\\nhaving arrived at the idea of good, which is the end of the science of\\ndialectic, he is asked, what is the nature, and what are the divisions\\nof the science? he refuses to answer, as if intending by the refusal to\\nintimate that the state of knowledge which then existed was not such as\\nwould allow the philosopher to enter into his final rest. the previous\\nsciences must first be studied, and will, we may add, continue to be\\nstudied tell the end of time, although in a sense different from any\\nwhich plato could have conceived. but we may observe, that while he is\\naware of the vacancy of his own ideal, he is full of enthusiasm in the\\ncontemplation of it. looking into the orb of light, he sees nothing,\\nbut he is warmed and elevated. the hebrew prophet believed that faith\\nin god would enable him to govern the world; the greek philosopher\\nimagined that contemplation of the good would make a legislator. there\\nis as much to be filled up in the one case as in the other, and the one\\nmode of conception is to the israelite what the other is to the greek.\\nboth find a repose in a divine perfection, which, whether in a more\\npersonal or impersonal form, exists without them and independently of\\nthem, as well as within them.\\n\\nthere is no mention of the idea of good in the timaeus, nor of the\\ndivine creator of the world in the republic; and we are naturally led\\nto ask in what relation they stand to one another. is god above or\\nbelow the idea of good? or is the idea of good another mode of\\nconceiving god? the latter appears to be the truer answer. to the greek\\nphilosopher the perfection and unity of god was a far higher conception\\nthan his personality, which he hardly found a word to express, and\\nwhich to him would have seemed to be borrowed from mythology. to the\\nchristian, on the other hand, or to the modern thinker in general, it\\nis difficult, if not impossible, to attach reality to what he terms\\nmere abstraction; while to plato this very abstraction is the truest\\nand most real of all things. hence, from a difference in forms of\\nthought, plato appears to be resting on a creation of his own mind\\nonly. but if we may be allowed to paraphrase the idea of good by the\\nwords ‘intelligent principle of law and order in the universe,\\nembracing equally man and nature,’ we begin to find a meeting-point\\nbetween him and ourselves.\\n\\nthe question whether the ruler or statesman should be a philosopher is\\none that has not lost interest in modern times. in most countries of\\neurope and asia there has been some one in the course of ages who has\\ntruly united the power of command with the power of thought and\\nreflection, as there have been also many false combinations of these\\nqualities. some kind of speculative power is necessary both in\\npractical and political life; like the rhetorician in the phaedrus, men\\nrequire to have a conception of the varieties of human character, and\\nto be raised on great occasions above the commonplaces of ordinary\\nlife. yet the idea of the philosopher-statesman has never been popular\\nwith the mass of mankind; partly because he cannot take the world into\\nhis confidence or make them understand the motives from which he acts;\\nand also because they are jealous of a power which they do not\\nunderstand. the revolution which human nature desires to effect step by\\nstep in many ages is likely to be precipitated by him in a single year\\nor life. they are afraid that in the pursuit of his greater aims he may\\ndisregard the common feelings of humanity, he is too apt to be looking\\ninto the distant future or back into the remote past, and unable to see\\nactions or events which, to use an expression of plato’s ‘are tumbling\\nout at his feet.’ besides, as plato would say, there are other\\ncorruptions of these philosophical statesmen. either ‘the native hue of\\nresolution is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,’ and at the\\nmoment when action above all things is required he is undecided, or\\ngeneral principles are enunciated by him in order to cover some change\\nof policy; or his ignorance of the world has made him more easily fall\\na prey to the arts of others; or in some cases he has been converted\\ninto a courtier, who enjoys the luxury of holding liberal opinions, but\\nwas never known to perform a liberal action. no wonder that mankind\\nhave been in the habit of calling statesmen of this class pedants,\\nsophisters, doctrinaires, visionaries. for, as we may be allowed to\\nsay, a little parodying the words of plato, ‘they have seen bad\\nimitations of the philosopher-statesman.’ but a man in whom the power\\nof thought and action are perfectly balanced, equal to the present,\\nreaching forward to the future, ‘such a one,’ ruling in a\\nconstitutional state, ‘they have never seen.’\\n\\nbut as the philosopher is apt to fail in the routine of political life,\\nso the ordinary statesman is also apt to fail in extraordinary crises.\\nwhen the face of the world is beginning to alter, and thunder is heard\\nin the distance, he is still guided by his old maxims, and is the slave\\nof his inveterate party prejudices; he cannot perceive the signs of the\\ntimes; instead of looking forward he looks back; he learns nothing and\\nforgets nothing; with ‘wise saws and modern instances’ he would stem\\nthe rising tide of revolution. he lives more and more within the circle\\nof his own party, as the world without him becomes stronger. this seems\\nto be the reason why the old order of things makes so poor a figure\\nwhen confronted with the new, why churches can never reform, why most\\npolitical changes are made blindly and convulsively. the great crises\\nin the history of nations have often been met by an ecclesiastical\\npositiveness, and a more obstinate reassertion of principles which have\\nlost their hold upon a nation. the fixed ideas of a reactionary\\nstatesman may be compared to madness; they grow upon him, and he\\nbecomes possessed by them; no judgement of others is ever admitted by\\nhim to be weighed in the balance against his own.\\n\\n(d) plato, labouring under what, to modern readers, appears to have\\nbeen a confusion of ideas, assimilates the state to the individual, and\\nfails to distinguish ethics from politics. he thinks that to be most of\\na state which is most like one man, and in which the citizens have the\\ngreatest uniformity of character. he does not see that the analogy is\\npartly fallacious, and that the will or character of a state or nation\\nis really the balance or rather the surplus of individual wills, which\\nare limited by the condition of having to act in common. the movement\\nof a body of men can never have the pliancy or facility of a single\\nman; the freedom of the individual, which is always limited, becomes\\nstill more straitened when transferred to a nation. the powers of\\naction and feeling are necessarily weaker and more balanced when they\\nare diffused through a community; whence arises the often discussed\\nquestion, ‘can a nation, like an individual, have a conscience?’ we\\nhesitate to say that the characters of nations are nothing more than\\nthe sum of the characters of the individuals who compose them; because\\nthere may be tendencies in individuals which react upon one another. a\\nwhole nation may be wiser than any one man in it; or may be animated by\\nsome common opinion or feeling which could not equally have affected\\nthe mind of a single person, or may have been inspired by a leader of\\ngenius to perform acts more than human. plato does not appear to have\\nanalysed the complications which arise out of the collective action of\\nmankind. neither is he capable of seeing that analogies, though\\nspecious as arguments, may often have no foundation in fact, or of\\ndistinguishing between what is intelligible or vividly present to the\\nmind, and what is true. in this respect he is far below aristotle, who\\nis comparatively seldom imposed upon by false analogies. he cannot\\ndisentangle the arts from the virtues—at least he is always arguing\\nfrom one to the other. his notion of music is transferred from harmony\\nof sounds to harmony of life: in this he is assisted by the ambiguities\\nof language as well as by the prevalence of pythagorean notions. and\\nhaving once assimilated the state to the individual, he imagines that\\nhe will find the succession of states paralleled in the lives of\\nindividuals.\\n\\nstill, through this fallacious medium, a real enlargement of ideas is\\nattained. when the virtues as yet presented no distinct conception to\\nthe mind, a great advance was made by the comparison of them with the\\narts; for virtue is partly art, and has an outward form as well as an\\ninward principle. the harmony of music affords a lively image of the\\nharmonies of the world and of human life, and may be regarded as a\\nsplendid illustration which was naturally mistaken for a real analogy.\\nin the same way the identification of ethics with politics has a\\ntendency to give definiteness to ethics, and also to elevate and\\nennoble men’s notions of the aims of government and of the duties of\\ncitizens; for ethics from one point of view may be conceived as an\\nidealized law and politics; and politics, as ethics reduced to the\\nconditions of human society. there have been evils which have arisen\\nout of the attempt to identify them, and this has led to the separation\\nor antagonism of them, which has been introduced by modern political\\nwriters. but we may likewise feel that something has been lost in their\\nseparation, and that the ancient philosophers who estimated the moral\\nand intellectual wellbeing of mankind first, and the wealth of nations\\nand individuals second, may have a salutary influence on the\\nspeculations of modern times. many political maxims originate in a\\nreaction against an opposite error; and when the errors against which\\nthey were directed have passed away, they in turn become errors.\\n\\n3. plato’s views of education are in several respects remarkable; like\\nthe rest of the republic they are partly greek and partly ideal,\\nbeginning with the ordinary curriculum of the greek youth, and\\nextending to after-life. plato is the first writer who distinctly says\\nthat education is to comprehend the whole of life, and to be a\\npreparation for another in which education begins again. this is the\\ncontinuous thread which runs through the republic, and which more than\\nany other of his ideas admits of an application to modern life.\\n\\nhe has long given up the notion that virtue cannot be taught; and he is\\ndisposed to modify the thesis of the protagoras, that the virtues are\\none and not many. he is not unwilling to admit the sensible world into\\nhis scheme of truth. nor does he assert in the republic the\\ninvoluntariness of vice, which is maintained by him in the timaeus,\\nsophist, and laws (protag., apol., gorg.). nor do the so-called\\nplatonic ideas recovered from a former state of existence affect his\\ntheory of mental improvement. still we observe in him the remains of\\nthe old socratic doctrine, that true knowledge must be elicited from\\nwithin, and is to be sought for in ideas, not in particulars of sense.\\neducation, as he says, will implant a principle of intelligence which\\nis better than ten thousand eyes. the paradox that the virtues are one,\\nand the kindred notion that all virtue is knowledge, are not entirely\\nrenounced; the first is seen in the supremacy given to justice over the\\nrest; the second in the tendency to absorb the moral virtues in the\\nintellectual, and to centre all goodness in the contemplation of the\\nidea of good. the world of sense is still depreciated and identified\\nwith opinion, though admitted to be a shadow of the true. in the\\nrepublic he is evidently impressed with the conviction that vice arises\\nchiefly from ignorance and may be cured by education; the multitude are\\nhardly to be deemed responsible for what they do. a faint allusion to\\nthe doctrine of reminiscence occurs in the tenth book; but plato’s\\nviews of education have no more real connection with a previous state\\nof existence than our own; he only proposes to elicit from the mind\\nthat which is there already. education is represented by him, not as\\nthe filling of a vessel, but as the turning the eye of the soul towards\\nthe light.\\n\\nhe treats first of music or literature, which he divides into true and\\nfalse, and then goes on to gymnastics; of infancy in the republic he\\ntakes no notice, though in the laws he gives sage counsels about the\\nnursing of children and the management of the mothers, and would have\\nan education which is even prior to birth. but in the republic he\\nbegins with the age at which the child is capable of receiving ideas,\\nand boldly asserts, in language which sounds paradoxical to modern\\nears, that he must be taught the false before he can learn the true.\\nthe modern and ancient philosophical world are not agreed about truth\\nand falsehood; the one identifies truth almost exclusively with fact,\\nthe other with ideas. this is the difference between ourselves and\\nplato, which is, however, partly a difference of words. for we too\\nshould admit that a child must receive many lessons which he\\nimperfectly understands; he must be taught some things in a figure\\nonly, some too which he can hardly be expected to believe when he grows\\nolder; but we should limit the use of fiction by the necessity of the\\ncase. plato would draw the line differently; according to him the aim\\nof early education is not truth as a matter of fact, but truth as a\\nmatter of principle; the child is to be taught first simple religious\\ntruths, and then simple moral truths, and insensibly to learn the\\nlesson of good manners and good taste. he would make an entire\\nreformation of the old mythology; like xenophanes and heracleitus he is\\nsensible of the deep chasm which separates his own age from homer and\\nhesiod, whom he quotes and invests with an imaginary authority, but\\nonly for his own purposes. the lusts and treacheries of the gods are to\\nbe banished; the terrors of the world below are to be dispelled; the\\nmisbehaviour of the homeric heroes is not to be a model for youth. but\\nthere is another strain heard in homer which may teach our youth\\nendurance; and something may be learnt in medicine from the simple\\npractice of the homeric age. the principles on which religion is to be\\nbased are two only: first, that god is true; secondly, that he is good.\\nmodern and christian writers have often fallen short of these; they can\\nhardly be said to have gone beyond them.\\n\\nthe young are to be brought up in happy surroundings, out of the way of\\nsights or sounds which may hurt the character or vitiate the taste.\\nthey are to live in an atmosphere of health; the breeze is always to be\\nwafting to them the impressions of truth and goodness. could such an\\neducation be realized, or if our modern religious education could be\\nbound up with truth and virtue and good manners and good taste, that\\nwould be the best hope of human improvement. plato, like ourselves, is\\nlooking forward to changes in the moral and religious world, and is\\npreparing for them. he recognizes the danger of unsettling young men’s\\nminds by sudden changes of laws and principles, by destroying the\\nsacredness of one set of ideas when there is nothing else to take their\\nplace. he is afraid too of the influence of the drama, on the ground\\nthat it encourages false sentiment, and therefore he would not have his\\nchildren taken to the theatre; he thinks that the effect on the\\nspectators is bad, and on the actors still worse. his idea of education\\nis that of harmonious growth, in which are insensibly learnt the\\nlessons of temperance and endurance, and the body and mind develope in\\nequal proportions. the first principle which runs through all art and\\nnature is simplicity; this also is to be the rule of human life.\\n\\nthe second stage of education is gymnastic, which answers to the period\\nof muscular growth and development. the simplicity which is enforced in\\nmusic is extended to gymnastic; plato is aware that the training of the\\nbody may be inconsistent with the training of the mind, and that bodily\\nexercise may be easily overdone. excessive training of the body is apt\\nto give men a headache or to render them sleepy at a lecture on\\nphilosophy, and this they attribute not to the true cause, but to the\\nnature of the subject. two points are noticeable in plato’s treatment\\nof gymnastic:—first, that the time of training is entirely separated\\nfrom the time of literary education. he seems to have thought that two\\nthings of an opposite and different nature could not be learnt at the\\nsame time. here we can hardly agree with him; and, if we may judge by\\nexperience, the effect of spending three years between the ages of\\nfourteen and seventeen in mere bodily exercise would be far from\\nimproving to the intellect. secondly, he affirms that music and\\ngymnastic are not, as common opinion is apt to imagine, intended, the\\none for the cultivation of the mind and the other of the body, but that\\nthey are both equally designed for the improvement of the mind. the\\nbody, in his view, is the servant of the mind; the subjection of the\\nlower to the higher is for the advantage of both. and doubtless the\\nmind may exercise a very great and paramount influence over the body,\\nif exerted not at particular moments and by fits and starts, but\\ncontinuously, in making preparation for the whole of life. other greek\\nwriters saw the mischievous tendency of spartan discipline (arist. pol;\\nthuc.). but only plato recognized the fundamental error on which the\\npractice was based.\\n\\nthe subject of gymnastic leads plato to the sister subject of medicine,\\nwhich he further illustrates by the parallel of law. the modern\\ndisbelief in medicine has led in this, as in some other departments of\\nknowledge, to a demand for greater simplicity; physicians are becoming\\naware that they often make diseases ‘greater and more complicated’ by\\ntheir treatment of them (rep.). in two thousand years their art has\\nmade but slender progress; what they have gained in the analysis of the\\nparts is in a great degree lost by their feebler conception of the\\nhuman frame as a whole. they have attended more to the cure of diseases\\nthan to the conditions of health; and the improvements in medicine have\\nbeen more than counterbalanced by the disuse of regular training. until\\nlately they have hardly thought of air and water, the importance of\\nwhich was well understood by the ancients; as aristotle remarks, ‘air\\nand water, being the elements which we most use, have the greatest\\neffect upon health’ (polit.). for ages physicians have been under the\\ndominion of prejudices which have only recently given way; and now\\nthere are as many opinions in medicine as in theology, and an equal\\ndegree of scepticism and some want of toleration about both. plato has\\nseveral good notions about medicine; according to him, ‘the eye cannot\\nbe cured without the rest of the body, nor the body without the mind’\\n(charm.). no man of sense, he says in the timaeus, would take physic;\\nand we heartily sympathize with him in the laws when he declares that\\n‘the limbs of the rustic worn with toil will derive more benefit from\\nwarm baths than from the prescriptions of a not over wise doctor.’ but\\nwe can hardly praise him when, in obedience to the authority of homer,\\nhe depreciates diet, or approve of the inhuman spirit in which he would\\nget rid of invalid and useless lives by leaving them to die. he does\\nnot seem to have considered that the ‘bridle of theages’ might be\\naccompanied by qualities which were of far more value to the state than\\nthe health or strength of the citizens; or that the duty of taking care\\nof the helpless might be an important element of education in a state.\\nthe physician himself (this is a delicate and subtle observation)\\nshould not be a man in robust health; he should have, in modern\\nphraseology, a nervous temperament; he should have experience of\\ndisease in his own person, in order that his powers of observation may\\nbe quickened in the case of others.\\n\\nthe perplexity of medicine is paralleled by the perplexity of law; in\\nwhich, again, plato would have men follow the golden rule of\\nsimplicity. greater matters are to be determined by the legislator or\\nby the oracle of delphi, lesser matters are to be left to the temporary\\nregulation of the citizens themselves. plato is aware that laissez\\nfaire is an important element of government. the diseases of a state\\nare like the heads of a hydra; they multiply when they are cut off. the\\ntrue remedy for them is not extirpation but prevention. and the way to\\nprevent them is to take care of education, and education will take care\\nof all the rest. so in modern times men have often felt that the only\\npolitical measure worth having—the only one which would produce any\\ncertain or lasting effect, was a measure of national education. and in\\nour own more than in any previous age the necessity has been recognized\\nof restoring the ever-increasing confusion of law to simplicity and\\ncommon sense.\\n\\nwhen the training in music and gymnastic is completed, there follows\\nthe first stage of active and public life. but soon education is to\\nbegin again from a new point of view. in the interval between the\\nfourth and seventh books we have discussed the nature of knowledge, and\\nhave thence been led to form a higher conception of what was required\\nof us. for true knowledge, according to plato, is of abstractions, and\\nhas to do, not with particulars or individuals, but with universals\\nonly; not with the beauties of poetry, but with the ideas of\\nphilosophy. and the great aim of education is the cultivation of the\\nhabit of abstraction. this is to be acquired through the study of the\\nmathematical sciences. they alone are capable of giving ideas of\\nrelation, and of arousing the dormant energies of thought.\\n\\nmathematics in the age of plato comprehended a very small part of that\\nwhich is now included in them; but they bore a much larger proportion\\nto the sum of human knowledge. they were the only organon of thought\\nwhich the human mind at that time possessed, and the only measure by\\nwhich the chaos of particulars could be reduced to rule and order. the\\nfaculty which they trained was naturally at war with the poetical or\\nimaginative; and hence to plato, who is everywhere seeking for\\nabstractions and trying to get rid of the illusions of sense, nearly\\nthe whole of education is contained in them. they seemed to have an\\ninexhaustible application, partly because their true limits were not\\nyet understood. these plato himself is beginning to investigate; though\\nnot aware that number and figure are mere abstractions of sense, he\\nrecognizes that the forms used by geometry are borrowed from the\\nsensible world. he seeks to find the ultimate ground of mathematical\\nideas in the idea of good, though he does not satisfactorily explain\\nthe connexion between them; and in his conception of the relation of\\nideas to numbers, he falls very far short of the definiteness\\nattributed to him by aristotle (met.). but if he fails to recognize the\\ntrue limits of mathematics, he also reaches a point beyond them; in his\\nview, ideas of number become secondary to a higher conception of\\nknowledge. the dialectician is as much above the mathematician as the\\nmathematician is above the ordinary man. the one, the self-proving, the\\ngood which is the higher sphere of dialectic, is the perfect truth to\\nwhich all things ascend, and in which they finally repose.\\n\\nthis self-proving unity or idea of good is a mere vision of which no\\ndistinct explanation can be given, relative only to a particular stage\\nin greek philosophy. it is an abstraction under which no individuals\\nare comprehended, a whole which has no parts (arist., nic. eth.). the\\nvacancy of such a form was perceived by aristotle, but not by plato.\\nnor did he recognize that in the dialectical process are included two\\nor more methods of investigation which are at variance with each other.\\nhe did not see that whether he took the longer or the shorter road, no\\nadvance could be made in this way. and yet such visions often have an\\nimmense effect; for although the method of science cannot anticipate\\nscience, the idea of science, not as it is, but as it will be in the\\nfuture, is a great and inspiring principle. in the pursuit of knowledge\\nwe are always pressing forward to something beyond us; and as a false\\nconception of knowledge, for example the scholastic philosophy, may\\nlead men astray during many ages, so the true ideal, though vacant, may\\ndraw all their thoughts in a right direction. it makes a great\\ndifference whether the general expectation of knowledge, as this\\nindefinite feeling may be termed, is based upon a sound judgment. for\\nmankind may often entertain a true conception of what knowledge ought\\nto be when they have but a slender experience of facts. the correlation\\nof the sciences, the consciousness of the unity of nature, the idea of\\nclassification, the sense of proportion, the unwillingness to stop\\nshort of certainty or to confound probability with truth, are important\\nprinciples of the higher education. although plato could tell us\\nnothing, and perhaps knew that he could tell us nothing, of the\\nabsolute truth, he has exercised an influence on the human mind which\\neven at the present day is not exhausted; and political and social\\nquestions may yet arise in which the thoughts of plato may be read anew\\nand receive a fresh meaning.\\n\\nthe idea of good is so called only in the republic, but there are\\ntraces of it in other dialogues of plato. it is a cause as well as an\\nidea, and from this point of view may be compared with the creator of\\nthe timaeus, who out of his goodness created all things. it corresponds\\nto a certain extent with the modern conception of a law of nature, or\\nof a final cause, or of both in one, and in this regard may be\\nconnected with the measure and symmetry of the philebus. it is\\nrepresented in the symposium under the aspect of beauty, and is\\nsupposed to be attained there by stages of initiation, as here by\\nregular gradations of knowledge. viewed subjectively, it is the process\\nor science of dialectic. this is the science which, according to the\\nphaedrus, is the true basis of rhetoric, which alone is able to\\ndistinguish the natures and classes of men and things; which divides a\\nwhole into the natural parts, and reunites the scattered parts into a\\nnatural or organized whole; which defines the abstract essences or\\nuniversal ideas of all things, and connects them; which pierces the\\nveil of hypotheses and reaches the final cause or first principle of\\nall; which regards the sciences in relation to the idea of good. this\\nideal science is the highest process of thought, and may be described\\nas the soul conversing with herself or holding communion with eternal\\ntruth and beauty, and in another form is the everlasting question and\\nanswer—the ceaseless interrogative of socrates. the dialogues of plato\\nare themselves examples of the nature and method of dialectic. viewed\\nobjectively, the idea of good is a power or cause which makes the world\\nwithout us correspond with the world within. yet this world without us\\nis still a world of ideas. with plato the investigation of nature is\\nanother department of knowledge, and in this he seeks to attain only\\nprobable conclusions (timaeus).\\n\\nif we ask whether this science of dialectic which plato only half\\nexplains to us is more akin to logic or to metaphysics, the answer is\\nthat in his mind the two sciences are not as yet distinguished, any\\nmore than the subjective and objective aspects of the world and of man,\\nwhich german philosophy has revealed to us. nor has he determined\\nwhether his science of dialectic is at rest or in motion, concerned\\nwith the contemplation of absolute being, or with a process of\\ndevelopment and evolution. modern metaphysics may be described as the\\nscience of abstractions, or as the science of the evolution of thought;\\nmodern logic, when passing beyond the bounds of mere aristotelian\\nforms, may be defined as the science of method. the germ of both of\\nthem is contained in the platonic dialectic; all metaphysicians have\\nsomething in common with the ideas of plato; all logicians have derived\\nsomething from the method of plato. the nearest approach in modern\\nphilosophy to the universal science of plato, is to be found in the\\nhegelian ‘succession of moments in the unity of the idea.’ plato and\\nhegel alike seem to have conceived the world as the correlation of\\nabstractions; and not impossibly they would have understood one another\\nbetter than any of their commentators understand them (swift’s voyage\\nto laputa. ‘having a desire to see those ancients who were most\\nrenowned for wit and learning, i set apart one day on purpose. i\\nproposed that homer and aristotle might appear at the head of all their\\ncommentators; but these were so numerous that some hundreds were forced\\nto attend in the court and outward rooms of the palace. i knew, and\\ncould distinguish these two heroes, at first sight, not only from the\\ncrowd, but from each other. homer was the taller and comelier person of\\nthe two, walked very erect for one of his age, and his eyes were the\\nmost quick and piercing i ever beheld. aristotle stooped much, and made\\nuse of a staff. his visage was meagre, his hair lank and thin, and his\\nvoice hollow. i soon discovered that both of them were perfect\\nstrangers to the rest of the company, and had never seen or heard of\\nthem before. and i had a whisper from a ghost, who shall be nameless,\\n“that these commentators always kept in the most distant quarters from\\ntheir principals, in the lower world, through a consciousness of shame\\nand guilt, because they had so horribly misrepresented the meaning of\\nthese authors to posterity.” i introduced didymus and eustathius to\\nhomer, and prevailed on him to treat them better than perhaps they\\ndeserved, for he soon found they wanted a genius to enter into the\\nspirit of a poet. but aristotle was out of all patience with the\\naccount i gave him of scotus and ramus, as i presented them to him; and\\nhe asked them “whether the rest of the tribe were as great dunces as\\nthemselves?”’). there is, however, a difference between them: for\\nwhereas hegel is thinking of all the minds of men as one mind, which\\ndevelopes the stages of the idea in different countries or at different\\ntimes in the same country, with plato these gradations are regarded\\nonly as an order of thought or ideas; the history of the human mind had\\nnot yet dawned upon him.\\n\\nmany criticisms may be made on plato’s theory of education. while in\\nsome respects he unavoidably falls short of modern thinkers, in others\\nhe is in advance of them. he is opposed to the modes of education which\\nprevailed in his own time; but he can hardly be said to have discovered\\nnew ones. he does not see that education is relative to the characters\\nof individuals; he only desires to impress the same form of the state\\non the minds of all. he has no sufficient idea of the effect of\\nliterature on the formation of the mind, and greatly exaggerates that\\nof mathematics. his aim is above all things to train the reasoning\\nfaculties; to implant in the mind the spirit and power of abstraction;\\nto explain and define general notions, and, if possible, to connect\\nthem. no wonder that in the vacancy of actual knowledge his followers,\\nand at times even he himself, should have fallen away from the doctrine\\nof ideas, and have returned to that branch of knowledge in which alone\\nthe relation of the one and many can be truly seen—the science of\\nnumber. in his views both of teaching and training he might be styled,\\nin modern language, a doctrinaire; after the spartan fashion he would\\nhave his citizens cast in one mould; he does not seem to consider that\\nsome degree of freedom, ‘a little wholesome neglect,’ is necessary to\\nstrengthen and develope the character and to give play to the\\nindividual nature. his citizens would not have acquired that knowledge\\nwhich in the vision of er is supposed to be gained by the pilgrims from\\ntheir experience of evil.\\n\\non the other hand, plato is far in advance of modern philosophers and\\ntheologians when he teaches that education is to be continued through\\nlife and will begin again in another. he would never allow education of\\nsome kind to cease; although he was aware that the proverbial saying of\\nsolon, ‘i grow old learning many things,’ cannot be applied literally.\\nhimself ravished with the contemplation of the idea of good, and\\ndelighting in solid geometry (rep.), he has no difficulty in imagining\\nthat a lifetime might be passed happily in such pursuits. we who know\\nhow many more men of business there are in the world than real students\\nor thinkers, are not equally sanguine. the education which he proposes\\nfor his citizens is really the ideal life of the philosopher or man of\\ngenius, interrupted, but only for a time, by practical duties,—a life\\nnot for the many, but for the few.\\n\\nyet the thought of plato may not be wholly incapable of application to\\nour own times. even if regarded as an ideal which can never be\\nrealized, it may have a great effect in elevating the characters of\\nmankind, and raising them above the routine of their ordinary\\noccupation or profession. it is the best form under which we can\\nconceive the whole of life. nevertheless the idea of plato is not\\neasily put into practice. for the education of after life is\\nnecessarily the education which each one gives himself. men and women\\ncannot be brought together in schools or colleges at forty or fifty\\nyears of age; and if they could the result would be disappointing. the\\ndestination of most men is what plato would call ‘the den’ for the\\nwhole of life, and with that they are content. neither have they\\nteachers or advisers with whom they can take counsel in riper years.\\nthere is no ‘schoolmaster abroad’ who will tell them of their faults,\\nor inspire them with the higher sense of duty, or with the ambition of\\na true success in life; no socrates who will convict them of ignorance;\\nno christ, or follower of christ, who will reprove them of sin. hence\\nthey have a difficulty in receiving the first element of improvement,\\nwhich is self-knowledge. the hopes of youth no longer stir them; they\\nrather wish to rest than to pursue high objects. a few only who have\\ncome across great men and women, or eminent teachers of religion and\\nmorality, have received a second life from them, and have lighted a\\ncandle from the fire of their genius.\\n\\nthe want of energy is one of the main reasons why so few persons\\ncontinue to improve in later years. they have not the will, and do not\\nknow the way. they ‘never try an experiment,’ or look up a point of\\ninterest for themselves; they make no sacrifices for the sake of\\nknowledge; their minds, like their bodies, at a certain age become\\nfixed. genius has been defined as ‘the power of taking pains’; but\\nhardly any one keeps up his interest in knowledge throughout a whole\\nlife. the troubles of a family, the business of making money, the\\ndemands of a profession destroy the elasticity of the mind. the waxen\\ntablet of the memory which was once capable of receiving ‘true thoughts\\nand clear impressions’ becomes hard and crowded; there is not room for\\nthe accumulations of a long life (theaet.). the student, as years\\nadvance, rather makes an exchange of knowledge than adds to his stores.\\nthere is no pressing necessity to learn; the stock of classics or\\nhistory or natural science which was enough for a man at twenty-five is\\nenough for him at fifty. neither is it easy to give a definite answer\\nto any one who asks how he is to improve. for self-education consists\\nin a thousand things, commonplace in themselves,—in adding to what we\\nare by nature something of what we are not; in learning to see\\nourselves as others see us; in judging, not by opinion, but by the\\nevidence of facts; in seeking out the society of superior minds; in a\\nstudy of lives and writings of great men; in observation of the world\\nand character; in receiving kindly the natural influence of different\\ntimes of life; in any act or thought which is raised above the practice\\nor opinions of mankind; in the pursuit of some new or original enquiry;\\nin any effort of mind which calls forth some latent power.\\n\\nif any one is desirous of carrying out in detail the platonic education\\nof after-life, some such counsels as the following may be offered to\\nhim:—that he shall choose the branch of knowledge to which his own mind\\nmost distinctly inclines, and in which he takes the greatest delight,\\neither one which seems to connect with his own daily employment, or,\\nperhaps, furnishes the greatest contrast to it. he may study from the\\nspeculative side the profession or business in which he is practically\\nengaged. he may make homer, dante, shakespeare, plato, bacon the\\nfriends and companions of his life. he may find opportunities of\\nhearing the living voice of a great teacher. he may select for enquiry\\nsome point of history or some unexplained phenomenon of nature. an hour\\na day passed in such scientific or literary pursuits will furnish as\\nmany facts as the memory can retain, and will give him ‘a pleasure not\\nto be repented of’ (timaeus). only let him beware of being the slave of\\ncrotchets, or of running after a will o’ the wisp in his ignorance, or\\nin his vanity of attributing to himself the gifts of a poet or assuming\\nthe air of a philosopher. he should know the limits of his own powers.\\nbetter to build up the mind by slow additions, to creep on quietly from\\none thing to another, to gain insensibly new powers and new interests\\nin knowledge, than to form vast schemes which are never destined to be\\nrealized. but perhaps, as plato would say, ‘this is part of another\\nsubject’ (tim.); though we may also defend our digression by his\\nexample (theaet.).\\n\\n4. we remark with surprise that the progress of nations or the natural\\ngrowth of institutions which fill modern treatises on political\\nphilosophy seem hardly ever to have attracted the attention of plato\\nand aristotle. the ancients were familiar with the mutability of human\\naffairs; they could moralize over the ruins of cities and the fall of\\nempires (plato, statesman, and sulpicius’ letter to cicero); by them\\nfate and chance were deemed to be real powers, almost persons, and to\\nhave had a great share in political events. the wiser of them like\\nthucydides believed that ‘what had been would be again,’ and that a\\ntolerable idea of the future could be gathered from the past. also they\\nhad dreams of a golden age which existed once upon a time and might\\nstill exist in some unknown land, or might return again in the remote\\nfuture. but the regular growth of a state enlightened by experience,\\nprogressing in knowledge, improving in the arts, of which the citizens\\nwere educated by the fulfilment of political duties, appears never to\\nhave come within the range of their hopes and aspirations. such a state\\nhad never been seen, and therefore could not be conceived by them.\\ntheir experience (aristot. metaph.; plato, laws) led them to conclude\\nthat there had been cycles of civilization in which the arts had been\\ndiscovered and lost many times over, and cities had been overthrown and\\nrebuilt again and again, and deluges and volcanoes and other natural\\nconvulsions had altered the face of the earth. tradition told them of\\nmany destructions of mankind and of the preservation of a remnant. the\\nworld began again after a deluge and was reconstructed out of the\\nfragments of itself. also they were acquainted with empires of unknown\\nantiquity, like the egyptian or assyrian; but they had never seen them\\ngrow, and could not imagine, any more than we can, the state of man\\nwhich preceded them. they were puzzled and awestricken by the egyptian\\nmonuments, of which the forms, as plato says, not in a figure, but\\nliterally, were ten thousand years old (laws), and they contrasted the\\nantiquity of egypt with their own short memories.\\n\\nthe early legends of hellas have no real connection with the later\\nhistory: they are at a distance, and the intermediate region is\\nconcealed from view; there is no road or path which leads from one to\\nthe other. at the beginning of greek history, in the vestibule of the\\ntemple, is seen standing first of all the figure of the legislator,\\nhimself the interpreter and servant of the god. the fundamental laws\\nwhich he gives are not supposed to change with time and circumstances.\\nthe salvation of the state is held rather to depend on the inviolable\\nmaintenance of them. they were sanctioned by the authority of heaven,\\nand it was deemed impiety to alter them. the desire to maintain them\\nunaltered seems to be the origin of what at first sight is very\\nsurprising to us—the intolerant zeal of plato against innovators in\\nreligion or politics (laws); although with a happy inconsistency he is\\nalso willing that the laws of other countries should be studied and\\nimprovements in legislation privately communicated to the nocturnal\\ncouncil (laws). the additions which were made to them in later ages in\\norder to meet the increasing complexity of affairs were still ascribed\\nby a fiction to the original legislator; and the words of such\\nenactments at athens were disputed over as if they had been the words\\nof solon himself. plato hopes to preserve in a later generation the\\nmind of the legislator; he would have his citizens remain within the\\nlines which he has laid down for them. he would not harass them with\\nminute regulations, he would have allowed some changes in the laws: but\\nnot changes which would affect the fundamental institutions of the\\nstate, such for example as would convert an aristocracy into a\\ntimocracy, or a timocracy into a popular form of government.\\n\\npassing from speculations to facts, we observe that progress has been\\nthe exception rather than the law of human history. and therefore we\\nare not surprised to find that the idea of progress is of modern rather\\nthan of ancient date; and, like the idea of a philosophy of history, is\\nnot more than a century or two old. it seems to have arisen out of the\\nimpression left on the human mind by the growth of the roman empire and\\nof the christian church, and to be due to the political and social\\nimprovements which they introduced into the world; and still more in\\nour own century to the idealism of the first french revolution and the\\ntriumph of american independence; and in a yet greater degree to the\\nvast material prosperity and growth of population in england and her\\ncolonies and in america. it is also to be ascribed in a measure to the\\ngreater study of the philosophy of history. the optimist temperament of\\nsome great writers has assisted the creation of it, while the opposite\\ncharacter has led a few to regard the future of the world as dark. the\\n‘spectator of all time and of all existence’ sees more of ‘the\\nincreasing purpose which through the ages ran’ than formerly: but to\\nthe inhabitant of a small state of hellas the vision was necessarily\\nlimited like the valley in which he dwelt. there was no remote past on\\nwhich his eye could rest, nor any future from which the veil was partly\\nlifted up by the analogy of history. the narrowness of view, which to\\nourselves appears so singular, was to him natural, if not unavoidable.\\n\\n5. for the relation of the republic to the statesman and the laws, and\\nthe two other works of plato which directly treat of politics, see the\\nintroductions to the two latter; a few general points of comparison may\\nbe touched upon in this place.\\n\\nand first of the laws.\\n\\n(1) the republic, though probably written at intervals, yet speaking\\ngenerally and judging by the indications of thought and style, may be\\nreasonably ascribed to the middle period of plato’s life: the laws are\\ncertainly the work of his declining years, and some portions of them at\\nany rate seem to have been written in extreme old age.\\n\\n(2) the republic is full of hope and aspiration: the laws bear the\\nstamp of failure and disappointment. the one is a finished work which\\nreceived the last touches of the author: the other is imperfectly\\nexecuted, and apparently unfinished. the one has the grace and beauty\\nof youth: the other has lost the poetical form, but has more of the\\nseverity and knowledge of life which is characteristic of old age.\\n\\n(3) the most conspicuous defect of the laws is the failure of dramatic\\npower, whereas the republic is full of striking contrasts of ideas and\\noppositions of character.\\n\\n(4) the laws may be said to have more the nature of a sermon, the\\nrepublic of a poem; the one is more religious, the other more\\nintellectual.\\n\\n(5) many theories of plato, such as the doctrine of ideas, the\\ngovernment of the world by philosophers, are not found in the laws; the\\nimmortality of the soul is first mentioned in xii; the person of\\nsocrates has altogether disappeared. the community of women and\\nchildren is renounced; the institution of common or public meals for\\nwomen (laws) is for the first time introduced (ar. pol.).\\n\\n(6) there remains in the laws the old enmity to the poets, who are\\nironically saluted in high-flown terms, and, at the same time, are\\nperemptorily ordered out of the city, if they are not willing to submit\\ntheir poems to the censorship of the magistrates (rep.).\\n\\n(7) though the work is in most respects inferior, there are a few\\npassages in the laws, such as the honour due to the soul, the evils of\\nlicentious or unnatural love, the whole of book x. (religion), the\\ndishonesty of retail trade, and bequests, which come more home to us,\\nand contain more of what may be termed the modern element in plato than\\nalmost anything in the republic.\\n\\nthe relation of the two works to one another is very well given:\\n\\n(1) by aristotle in the politics from the side of the laws:—\\n\\n‘the same, or nearly the same, objections apply to plato’s later work,\\nthe laws, and therefore we had better examine briefly the constitution\\nwhich is therein described. in the republic, socrates has definitely\\nsettled in all a few questions only; such as the community of women and\\nchildren, the community of property, and the constitution of the state.\\nthe population is divided into two classes—one of husbandmen, and the\\nother of warriors; from this latter is taken a third class of\\ncounsellors and rulers of the state. but socrates has not determined\\nwhether the husbandmen and artists are to have a share in the\\ngovernment, and whether they too are to carry arms and share in\\nmilitary service or not. he certainly thinks that the women ought to\\nshare in the education of the guardians, and to fight by their side.\\nthe remainder of the work is filled up with digressions foreign to the\\nmain subject, and with discussions about the education of the\\nguardians. in the laws there is hardly anything but laws; not much is\\nsaid about the constitution. this, which he had intended to make more\\nof the ordinary type, he gradually brings round to the other or ideal\\nform. for with the exception of the community of women and property, he\\nsupposes everything to be the same in both states; there is to be the\\nsame education; the citizens of both are to live free from servile\\noccupations, and there are to be common meals in both. the only\\ndifference is that in the laws the common meals are extended to women,\\nand the warriors number about 5000, but in the republic only 1000.’\\n\\n(2) by plato in the laws (book v.), from the side of the republic:—\\n\\n‘the first and highest form of the state and of the government and of\\nthe law is that in which there prevails most widely the ancient saying\\nthat “friends have all things in common.” whether there is now, or ever\\nwill be, this communion of women and children and of property, in which\\nthe private and individual is altogether banished from life, and things\\nwhich are by nature private, such as eyes and ears and hands, have\\nbecome common, and all men express praise and blame, and feel joy and\\nsorrow, on the same occasions, and the laws unite the city to the\\nutmost,—whether all this is possible or not, i say that no man, acting\\nupon any other principle, will ever constitute a state more exalted in\\nvirtue, or truer or better than this. such a state, whether inhabited\\nby gods or sons of gods, will make them blessed who dwell therein; and\\ntherefore to this we are to look for the pattern of the state, and to\\ncling to this, and, as far as possible, to seek for one which is like\\nthis. the state which we have now in hand, when created, will be\\nnearest to immortality and unity in the next degree; and after that, by\\nthe grace of god, we will complete the third one. and we will begin by\\nspeaking of the nature and origin of the second.’\\n\\nthe comparatively short work called the statesman or politicus in its\\nstyle and manner is more akin to the laws, while in its idealism it\\nrather resembles the republic. as far as we can judge by various\\nindications of language and thought, it must be later than the one and\\nof course earlier than the other. in both the republic and statesman a\\nclose connection is maintained between politics and dialectic. in the\\nstatesman, enquiries into the principles of method are interspersed\\nwith discussions about politics. the comparative advantages of the rule\\nof law and of a person are considered, and the decision given in favour\\nof a person (arist. pol.). but much may be said on the other side, nor\\nis the opposition necessary; for a person may rule by law, and law may\\nbe so applied as to be the living voice of the legislator. as in the\\nrepublic, there is a myth, describing, however, not a future, but a\\nformer existence of mankind. the question is asked, ‘whether the state\\nof innocence which is described in the myth, or a state like our own\\nwhich possesses art and science and distinguishes good from evil, is\\nthe preferable condition of man.’ to this question of the comparative\\nhappiness of civilized and primitive life, which was so often discussed\\nin the last century and in our own, no answer is given. the statesman,\\nthough less perfect in style than the republic and of far less range,\\nmay justly be regarded as one of the greatest of plato’s dialogues.\\n\\n6. others as well as plato have chosen an ideal republic to be the\\nvehicle of thoughts which they could not definitely express, or which\\nwent beyond their own age. the classical writing which approaches most\\nnearly to the republic of plato is the ‘de republica’ of cicero; but\\nneither in this nor in any other of his dialogues does he rival the art\\nof plato. the manners are clumsy and inferior; the hand of the\\nrhetorician is apparent at every turn. yet noble sentiments are\\nconstantly recurring: the true note of roman patriotism—‘we romans are\\na great people’—resounds through the whole work. like socrates, cicero\\nturns away from the phenomena of the heavens to civil and political\\nlife. he would rather not discuss the ‘two suns’ of which all rome was\\ntalking, when he can converse about ‘the two nations in one’ which had\\ndivided rome ever since the days of the gracchi. like socrates again,\\nspeaking in the person of scipio, he is afraid lest he should assume\\ntoo much the character of a teacher, rather than of an equal who is\\ndiscussing among friends the two sides of a question. he would confine\\nthe terms king or state to the rule of reason and justice, and he will\\nnot concede that title either to a democracy or to a monarchy. but\\nunder the rule of reason and justice he is willing to include the\\nnatural superior ruling over the natural inferior, which he compares to\\nthe soul ruling over the body. he prefers a mixture of forms of\\ngovernment to any single one. the two portraits of the just and the\\nunjust, which occur in the second book of the republic, are transferred\\nto the state—philus, one of the interlocutors, maintaining against his\\nwill the necessity of injustice as a principle of government, while the\\nother, laelius, supports the opposite thesis. his views of language and\\nnumber are derived from plato; like him he denounces the drama. he also\\ndeclares that if his life were to be twice as long he would have no\\ntime to read the lyric poets. the picture of democracy is translated by\\nhim word for word, though he had hardly shown himself able to ‘carry\\nthe jest’ of plato. he converts into a stately sentence the humorous\\nfancy about the animals, who ‘are so imbued with the spirit of\\ndemocracy that they make the passers-by get out of their way.’ his\\ndescription of the tyrant is imitated from plato, but is far inferior.\\nthe second book is historical, and claims for the roman constitution\\n(which is to him the ideal) a foundation of fact such as plato probably\\nintended to have given to the republic in the critias. his most\\nremarkable imitation of plato is the adaptation of the vision of er,\\nwhich is converted by cicero into the ‘somnium scipionis’; he has\\n‘romanized’ the myth of the republic, adding an argument for the\\nimmortality of the soul taken from the phaedrus, and some other touches\\nderived from the phaedo and the timaeus. though a beautiful tale and\\ncontaining splendid passages, the ‘somnium scipionis; is very inferior\\nto the vision of er; it is only a dream, and hardly allows the reader\\nto suppose that the writer believes in his own creation. whether his\\ndialogues were framed on the model of the lost dialogues of aristotle,\\nas he himself tells us, or of plato, to which they bear many\\nsuperficial resemblances, he is still the roman orator; he is not\\nconversing, but making speeches, and is never able to mould the\\nintractable latin to the grace and ease of the greek platonic dialogue.\\nbut if he is defective in form, much more is he inferior to the greek\\nin matter; he nowhere in his philosophical writings leaves upon our\\nminds the impression of an original thinker.\\n\\nplato’s republic has been said to be a church and not a state; and such\\nan ideal of a city in the heavens has always hovered over the christian\\nworld, and is embodied in st. augustine’s ‘de civitate dei,’ which is\\nsuggested by the decay and fall of the roman empire, much in the same\\nmanner in which we may imagine the republic of plato to have been\\ninfluenced by the decline of greek politics in the writer’s own age.\\nthe difference is that in the time of plato the degeneracy, though\\ncertain, was gradual and insensible: whereas the taking of rome by the\\ngoths stirred like an earthquake the age of st. augustine. men were\\ninclined to believe that the overthrow of the city was to be ascribed\\nto the anger felt by the old roman deities at the neglect of their\\nworship. st. augustine maintains the opposite thesis; he argues that\\nthe destruction of the roman empire is due, not to the rise of\\nchristianity, but to the vices of paganism. he wanders over roman\\nhistory, and over greek philosophy and mythology, and finds everywhere\\ncrime, impiety and falsehood. he compares the worst parts of the\\ngentile religions with the best elements of the faith of christ. he\\nshows nothing of the spirit which led others of the early christian\\nfathers to recognize in the writings of the greek philosophers the\\npower of the divine truth. he traces the parallel of the kingdom of\\ngod, that is, the history of the jews, contained in their scriptures,\\nand of the kingdoms of the world, which are found in gentile writers,\\nand pursues them both into an ideal future. it need hardly be remarked\\nthat his use both of greek and of roman historians and of the sacred\\nwritings of the jews is wholly uncritical. the heathen mythology, the\\nsybilline oracles, the myths of plato, the dreams of neo-platonists are\\nequally regarded by him as matter of fact. he must be acknowledged to\\nbe a strictly polemical or controversial writer who makes the best of\\neverything on one side and the worst of everything on the other. he has\\nno sympathy with the old roman life as plato has with greek life, nor\\nhas he any idea of the ecclesiastical kingdom which was to arise out of\\nthe ruins of the roman empire. he is not blind to the defects of the\\nchristian church, and looks forward to a time when christian and pagan\\nshall be alike brought before the judgment-seat, and the true city of\\ngod shall appear...the work of st. augustine is a curious repertory of\\nantiquarian learning and quotations, deeply penetrated with christian\\nethics, but showing little power of reasoning, and a slender knowledge\\nof the greek literature and language. he was a great genius, and a\\nnoble character, yet hardly capable of feeling or understanding\\nanything external to his own theology. of all the ancient philosophers\\nhe is most attracted by plato, though he is very slightly acquainted\\nwith his writings. he is inclined to believe that the idea of creation\\nin the timaeus is derived from the narrative in genesis; and he is\\nstrangely taken with the coincidence (?) of plato’s saying that ‘the\\nphilosopher is the lover of god,’ and the words of the book of exodus\\nin which god reveals himself to moses (exod.) he dwells at length on\\nmiracles performed in his own day, of which the evidence is regarded by\\nhim as irresistible. he speaks in a very interesting manner of the\\nbeauty and utility of nature and of the human frame, which he conceives\\nto afford a foretaste of the heavenly state and of the resurrection of\\nthe body. the book is not really what to most persons the title of it\\nwould imply, and belongs to an age which has passed away. but it\\ncontains many fine passages and thoughts which are for all time.\\n\\nthe short treatise de monarchia of dante is by far the most remarkable\\nof mediaeval ideals, and bears the impress of the great genius in whom\\nitaly and the middle ages are so vividly reflected. it is the vision of\\nan universal empire, which is supposed to be the natural and necessary\\ngovernment of the world, having a divine authority distinct from the\\npapacy, yet coextensive with it. it is not ‘the ghost of the dead roman\\nempire sitting crowned upon the grave thereof,’ but the legitimate heir\\nand successor of it, justified by the ancient virtues of the romans and\\nthe beneficence of their rule. their right to be the governors of the\\nworld is also confirmed by the testimony of miracles, and acknowledged\\nby st. paul when he appealed to caesar, and even more emphatically by\\nchrist himself, who could not have made atonement for the sins of men\\nif he had not been condemned by a divinely authorized tribunal. the\\nnecessity for the establishment of an universal empire is proved partly\\nby a priori arguments such as the unity of god and the unity of the\\nfamily or nation; partly by perversions of scripture and history, by\\nfalse analogies of nature, by misapplied quotations from the classics,\\nand by odd scraps and commonplaces of logic, showing a familiar but by\\nno means exact knowledge of aristotle (of plato there is none). but a\\nmore convincing argument still is the miserable state of the world,\\nwhich he touchingly describes. he sees no hope of happiness or peace\\nfor mankind until all nations of the earth are comprehended in a single\\nempire. the whole treatise shows how deeply the idea of the roman\\nempire was fixed in the minds of his contemporaries. not much argument\\nwas needed to maintain the truth of a theory which to his own\\ncontemporaries seemed so natural and congenial. he speaks, or rather\\npreaches, from the point of view, not of the ecclesiastic, but of the\\nlayman, although, as a good catholic, he is willing to acknowledge that\\nin certain respects the empire must submit to the church. the beginning\\nand end of all his noble reflections and of his arguments, good and\\nbad, is the aspiration ‘that in this little plot of earth belonging to\\nmortal man life may pass in freedom and peace.’ so inextricably is his\\nvision of the future bound up with the beliefs and circumstances of his\\nown age.\\n\\nthe ‘utopia’ of sir thomas more is a surprising monument of his genius,\\nand shows a reach of thought far beyond his contemporaries. the book\\nwas written by him at the age of about 34 or 35, and is full of the\\ngenerous sentiments of youth. he brings the light of plato to bear upon\\nthe miserable state of his own country. living not long after the wars\\nof the roses, and in the dregs of the catholic church in england, he is\\nindignant at the corruption of the clergy, at the luxury of the\\nnobility and gentry, at the sufferings of the poor, at the calamities\\ncaused by war. to the eye of more the whole world was in dissolution\\nand decay; and side by side with the misery and oppression which he has\\ndescribed in the first book of the utopia, he places in the second book\\nthe ideal state which by the help of plato he had constructed. the\\ntimes were full of stir and intellectual interest. the distant murmur\\nof the reformation was beginning to be heard. to minds like more’s,\\ngreek literature was a revelation: there had arisen an art of\\ninterpretation, and the new testament was beginning to be understood as\\nit had never been before, and has not often been since, in its natural\\nsense. the life there depicted appeared to him wholly unlike that of\\nchristian commonwealths, in which ‘he saw nothing but a certain\\nconspiracy of rich men procuring their own commodities under the name\\nand title of the commonwealth.’ he thought that christ, like plato,\\n‘instituted all things common,’ for which reason, he tells us, the\\ncitizens of utopia were the more willing to receive his doctrines\\n(‘howbeit, i think this was no small help and furtherance in the\\nmatter, that they heard us say that christ instituted among his, all\\nthings common, and that the same community doth yet remain in the\\nrightest christian communities’ (utopia).). the community of property\\nis a fixed idea with him, though he is aware of the arguments which may\\nbe urged on the other side (‘these things (i say), when i consider with\\nmyself, i hold well with plato, and do nothing marvel that he would\\nmake no laws for them that refused those laws, whereby all men should\\nhave and enjoy equal portions of riches and commodities. for the wise\\nmen did easily foresee this to be the one and only way to the wealth of\\na community, if equality of all things should be brought in and\\nestablished’ (utopia).). we wonder how in the reign of henry viii,\\nthough veiled in another language and published in a foreign country,\\nsuch speculations could have been endured.\\n\\nhe is gifted with far greater dramatic invention than any one who\\nsucceeded him, with the exception of swift. in the art of feigning he\\nis a worthy disciple of plato. like him, starting from a small portion\\nof fact, he founds his tale with admirable skill on a few lines in the\\nlatin narrative of the voyages of amerigo vespucci. he is very precise\\nabout dates and facts, and has the power of making us believe that the\\nnarrator of the tale must have been an eyewitness. we are fairly\\npuzzled by his manner of mixing up real and imaginary persons; his boy\\njohn clement and peter giles, citizen of antwerp, with whom he disputes\\nabout the precise words which are supposed to have been used by the\\n(imaginary) portuguese traveller, raphael hythloday. ‘i have the more\\ncause,’ says hythloday, ‘to fear that my words shall not be believed,\\nfor that i know how difficultly and hardly i myself would have believed\\nanother man telling the same, if i had not myself seen it with mine own\\neyes.’ or again: ‘if you had been with me in utopia, and had presently\\nseen their fashions and laws as i did which lived there five years and\\nmore, and would never have come thence, but only to make the new land\\nknown here,’ etc. more greatly regrets that he forgot to ask hythloday\\nin what part of the world utopia is situated; he ‘would have spent no\\nsmall sum of money rather than it should have escaped him,’ and he begs\\npeter giles to see hythloday or write to him and obtain an answer to\\nthe question. after this we are not surprised to hear that a professor\\nof divinity (perhaps ‘a late famous vicar of croydon in surrey,’ as the\\ntranslator thinks) is desirous of being sent thither as a missionary by\\nthe high bishop, ‘yea, and that he may himself be made bishop of\\nutopia, nothing doubting that he must obtain this bishopric with suit;\\nand he counteth that a godly suit which proceedeth not of the desire of\\nhonour or lucre, but only of a godly zeal.’ the design may have failed\\nthrough the disappearance of hythloday, concerning whom we have ‘very\\nuncertain news’ after his departure. there is no doubt, however, that\\nhe had told more and giles the exact situation of the island, but\\nunfortunately at the same moment more’s attention, as he is reminded in\\na letter from giles, was drawn off by a servant, and one of the company\\nfrom a cold caught on shipboard coughed so loud as to prevent giles\\nfrom hearing. and ‘the secret has perished’ with him; to this day the\\nplace of utopia remains unknown.\\n\\nthe words of phaedrus, ‘o socrates, you can easily invent egyptians or\\nanything,’ are recalled to our mind as we read this lifelike fiction.\\nyet the greater merit of the work is not the admirable art, but the\\noriginality of thought. more is as free as plato from the prejudices of\\nhis age, and far more tolerant. the utopians do not allow him who\\nbelieves not in the immortality of the soul to share in the\\nadministration of the state (laws), ‘howbeit they put him to no\\npunishment, because they be persuaded that it is in no man’s power to\\nbelieve what he list’; and ‘no man is to be blamed for reasoning in\\nsupport of his own religion (‘one of our company in my presence was\\nsharply punished. he, as soon as he was baptised, began, against our\\nwills, with more earnest affection than wisdom, to reason of christ’s\\nreligion, and began to wax so hot in his matter, that he did not only\\nprefer our religion before all other, but also did despise and condemn\\nall other, calling them profane, and the followers of them wicked and\\ndevilish, and the children of everlasting damnation. when he had thus\\nlong reasoned the matter, they laid hold on him, accused him, and\\ncondemned him into exile, not as a despiser of religion, but as a\\nseditious person and a raiser up of dissension among the people’).’ in\\nthe public services ‘no prayers be used, but such as every man may\\nboldly pronounce without giving offence to any sect.’ he says\\nsignificantly, ‘there be that give worship to a man that was once of\\nexcellent virtue or of famous glory, not only as god, but also the\\nchiefest and highest god. but the most and the wisest part, rejecting\\nall these, believe that there is a certain godly power unknown, far\\nabove the capacity and reach of man’s wit, dispersed throughout all the\\nworld, not in bigness, but in virtue and power. him they call the\\nfather of all. to him alone they attribute the beginnings, the\\nincreasings, the proceedings, the changes, and the ends of all things.\\nneither give they any divine honours to any other than him.’ so far was\\nmore from sharing the popular beliefs of his time. yet at the end he\\nreminds us that he does not in all respects agree with the customs and\\nopinions of the utopians which he describes. and we should let him have\\nthe benefit of this saving clause, and not rudely withdraw the veil\\nbehind which he has been pleased to conceal himself.\\n\\nnor is he less in advance of popular opinion in his political and moral\\nspeculations. he would like to bring military glory into contempt; he\\nwould set all sorts of idle people to profitable occupation, including\\nin the same class, priests, women, noblemen, gentlemen, and ‘sturdy and\\nvaliant beggars,’ that the labour of all may be reduced to six hours a\\nday. his dislike of capital punishment, and plans for the reformation\\nof offenders; his detestation of priests and lawyers (compare his\\nsatirical observation: ‘they (the utopians) have priests of exceeding\\nholiness, and therefore very few.); his remark that ‘although every one\\nmay hear of ravenous dogs and wolves and cruel man-eaters, it is not\\neasy to find states that are well and wisely governed,’ are curiously\\nat variance with the notions of his age and indeed with his own life.\\nthere are many points in which he shows a modern feeling and a\\nprophetic insight like plato. he is a sanitary reformer; he maintains\\nthat civilized states have a right to the soil of waste countries; he\\nis inclined to the opinion which places happiness in virtuous\\npleasures, but herein, as he thinks, not disagreeing from those other\\nphilosophers who define virtue to be a life according to nature. he\\nextends the idea of happiness so as to include the happiness of others;\\nand he argues ingeniously, ‘all men agree that we ought to make others\\nhappy; but if others, how much more ourselves!’ and still he thinks\\nthat there may be a more excellent way, but to this no man’s reason can\\nattain unless heaven should inspire him with a higher truth. his\\nceremonies before marriage; his humane proposal that war should be\\ncarried on by assassinating the leaders of the enemy, may be compared\\nto some of the paradoxes of plato. he has a charming fancy, like the\\naffinities of greeks and barbarians in the timaeus, that the utopians\\nlearnt the language of the greeks with the more readiness because they\\nwere originally of the same race with them. he is penetrated with the\\nspirit of plato, and quotes or adapts many thoughts both from the\\nrepublic and from the timaeus. he prefers public duties to private, and\\nis somewhat impatient of the importunity of relations. his citizens\\nhave no silver or gold of their own, but are ready enough to pay them\\nto their mercenaries. there is nothing of which he is more contemptuous\\nthan the love of money. gold is used for fetters of criminals, and\\ndiamonds and pearls for children’s necklaces (when the ambassadors came\\narrayed in gold and peacocks’ feathers ‘to the eyes of all the utopians\\nexcept very few, which had been in other countries for some reasonable\\ncause, all that gorgeousness of apparel seemed shameful and\\nreproachful. in so much that they most reverently saluted the vilest\\nand most abject of them for lords—passing over the ambassadors\\nthemselves without any honour, judging them by their wearing of golden\\nchains to be bondmen. you should have seen children also, that had cast\\naway their pearls and precious stones, when they saw the like sticking\\nupon the ambassadors’ caps, dig and push their mothers under the sides,\\nsaying thus to them—“look, though he were a little child still.” but\\nthe mother; yea and that also in good earnest: “peace, son,” saith she,\\n“i think he be some of the ambassadors’ fools.”’)\\n\\nlike plato he is full of satirical reflections on governments and\\nprinces; on the state of the world and of knowledge. the hero of his\\ndiscourse (hythloday) is very unwilling to become a minister of state,\\nconsidering that he would lose his independence and his advice would\\nnever be heeded (compare an exquisite passage, of which the conclusion\\nis as follows: ‘and verily it is naturally given...suppressed and\\nended.’) he ridicules the new logic of his time; the utopians could\\nnever be made to understand the doctrine of second intentions (‘for\\nthey have not devised one of all those rules of restrictions,\\namplifications, and suppositions, very wittily invented in the small\\nlogicals, which here our children in every place do learn. furthermore,\\nthey were never yet able to find out the second intentions; insomuch\\nthat none of them all could ever see man himself in common, as they\\ncall him, though he be (as you know) bigger than was ever any giant,\\nyea, and pointed to of us even with our finger.’) he is very severe on\\nthe sports of the gentry; the utopians count ‘hunting the lowest, the\\nvilest, and the most abject part of butchery.’ he quotes the words of\\nthe republic in which the philosopher is described ‘standing out of the\\nway under a wall until the driving storm of sleet and rain be\\noverpast,’ which admit of a singular application to more’s own fate;\\nalthough, writing twenty years before (about the year 1514), he can\\nhardly be supposed to have foreseen this. there is no touch of satire\\nwhich strikes deeper than his quiet remark that the greater part of the\\nprecepts of christ are more at variance with the lives of ordinary\\nchristians than the discourse of utopia (‘and yet the most part of them\\nis more dissident from the manners of the world now a days, than my\\ncommunication was. but preachers, sly and wily men, following your\\ncounsel (as i suppose) because they saw men evil-willing to frame their\\nmanners to christ’s rule, they have wrested and wried his doctrine,\\nand, like a rule of lead, have applied it to men’s manners, that by\\nsome means at the least way, they might agree together.’)\\n\\nthe ‘new atlantis’ is only a fragment, and far inferior in merit to the\\n‘utopia.’ the work is full of ingenuity, but wanting in creative fancy,\\nand by no means impresses the reader with a sense of credibility. in\\nsome places lord bacon is characteristically different from sir thomas\\nmore, as, for example, in the external state which he attributes to the\\ngovernor of solomon’s house, whose dress he minutely describes, while\\nto sir thomas more such trappings appear simple ridiculous. yet, after\\nthis programme of dress, bacon adds the beautiful trait, ‘that he had a\\nlook as though he pitied men.’ several things are borrowed by him from\\nthe timaeus; but he has injured the unity of style by adding thoughts\\nand passages which are taken from the hebrew scriptures.\\n\\nthe ‘city of the sun’ written by campanella (1568-1639), a dominican\\nfriar, several years after the ‘new atlantis’ of bacon, has many\\nresemblances to the republic of plato. the citizens have wives and\\nchildren in common; their marriages are of the same temporary sort, and\\nare arranged by the magistrates from time to time. they do not,\\nhowever, adopt his system of lots, but bring together the best natures,\\nmale and female, ‘according to philosophical rules.’ the infants until\\ntwo years of age are brought up by their mothers in public temples; and\\nsince individuals for the most part educate their children badly, at\\nthe beginning of their third year they are committed to the care of the\\nstate, and are taught at first, not out of books, but from paintings of\\nall kinds, which are emblazoned on the walls of the city. the city has\\nsix interior circuits of walls, and an outer wall which is the seventh.\\non this outer wall are painted the figures of legislators and\\nphilosophers, and on each of the interior walls the symbols or forms of\\nsome one of the sciences are delineated. the women are, for the most\\npart, trained, like the men, in warlike and other exercises; but they\\nhave two special occupations of their own. after a battle, they and the\\nboys soothe and relieve the wounded warriors; also they encourage them\\nwith embraces and pleasant words. some elements of the christian or\\ncatholic religion are preserved among them. the life of the apostles is\\ngreatly admired by this people because they had all things in common;\\nand the short prayer which jesus christ taught men is used in their\\nworship. it is a duty of the chief magistrates to pardon sins, and\\ntherefore the whole people make secret confession of them to the\\nmagistrates, and they to their chief, who is a sort of rector\\nmetaphysicus; and by this means he is well informed of all that is\\ngoing on in the minds of men. after confession, absolution is granted\\nto the citizens collectively, but no one is mentioned by name. there\\nalso exists among them a practice of perpetual prayer, performed by a\\nsuccession of priests, who change every hour. their religion is a\\nworship of god in trinity, that is of wisdom, love and power, but\\nwithout any distinction of persons. they behold in the sun the\\nreflection of his glory; mere graven images they reject, refusing to\\nfall under the ‘tyranny’ of idolatry.\\n\\nmany details are given about their customs of eating and drinking,\\nabout their mode of dressing, their employments, their wars. campanella\\nlooks forward to a new mode of education, which is to be a study of\\nnature, and not of aristotle. he would not have his citizens waste\\ntheir time in the consideration of what he calls ‘the dead signs of\\nthings.’ he remarks that he who knows one science only, does not really\\nknow that one any more than the rest, and insists strongly on the\\nnecessity of a variety of knowledge. more scholars are turned out in\\nthe city of the sun in one year than by contemporary methods in ten or\\nfifteen. he evidently believes, like bacon, that henceforward natural\\nscience will play a great part in education, a hope which seems hardly\\nto have been realized, either in our own or in any former age; at any\\nrate the fulfilment of it has been long deferred.\\n\\nthere is a good deal of ingenuity and even originality in this work,\\nand a most enlightened spirit pervades it. but it has little or no\\ncharm of style, and falls very far short of the ‘new atlantis’ of\\nbacon, and still more of the ‘utopia’ of sir thomas more. it is full of\\ninconsistencies, and though borrowed from plato, shows but a\\nsuperficial acquaintance with his writings. it is a work such as one\\nmight expect to have been written by a philosopher and man of genius\\nwho was also a friar, and who had spent twenty-seven years of his life\\nin a prison of the inquisition. the most interesting feature of the\\nbook, common to plato and sir thomas more, is the deep feeling which is\\nshown by the writer, of the misery and ignorance prevailing among the\\nlower classes in his own time. campanella takes note of aristotle’s\\nanswer to plato’s community of property, that in a society where all\\nthings are common, no individual would have any motive to work (arist.\\npol.): he replies, that his citizens being happy and contented in\\nthemselves (they are required to work only four hours a day), will have\\ngreater regard for their fellows than exists among men at present. he\\nthinks, like plato, that if he abolishes private feelings and\\ninterests, a great public feeling will take their place.\\n\\nother writings on ideal states, such as the ‘oceana’ of harrington, in\\nwhich the lord archon, meaning cromwell, is described, not as he was,\\nbut as he ought to have been; or the ‘argenis’ of barclay, which is an\\nhistorical allegory of his own time, are too unlike plato to be worth\\nmentioning. more interesting than either of these, and far more\\nplatonic in style and thought, is sir john eliot’s ‘monarchy of man,’\\nin which the prisoner of the tower, no longer able ‘to be a politician\\nin the land of his birth,’ turns away from politics to view ‘that other\\ncity which is within him,’ and finds on the very threshold of the grave\\nthat the secret of human happiness is the mastery of self. the change\\nof government in the time of the english commonwealth set men thinking\\nabout first principles, and gave rise to many works of this class...the\\ngreat original genius of swift owes nothing to plato; nor is there any\\ntrace in the conversation or in the works of dr. johnson of any\\nacquaintance with his writings. he probably would have refuted plato\\nwithout reading him, in the same fashion in which he supposed himself\\nto have refuted bishop berkeley’s theory of the non-existence of\\nmatter. if we except the so-called english platonists, or rather\\nneo-platonists, who never understood their master, and the writings of\\ncoleridge, who was to some extent a kindred spirit, plato has left no\\npermanent impression on english literature.\\n\\n7. human life and conduct are affected by ideals in the same way that\\nthey are affected by the examples of eminent men. neither the one nor\\nthe other are immediately applicable to practice, but there is a virtue\\nflowing from them which tends to raise individuals above the common\\nroutine of society or trade, and to elevate states above the mere\\ninterests of commerce or the necessities of self-defence. like the\\nideals of art they are partly framed by the omission of particulars;\\nthey require to be viewed at a certain distance, and are apt to fade\\naway if we attempt to approach them. they gain an imaginary\\ndistinctness when embodied in a state or in a system of philosophy, but\\nthey still remain the visions of ‘a world unrealized.’ more striking\\nand obvious to the ordinary mind are the examples of great men, who\\nhave served their own generation and are remembered in another. even in\\nour own family circle there may have been some one, a woman, or even a\\nchild, in whose face has shone forth a goodness more than human. the\\nideal then approaches nearer to us, and we fondly cling to it. the\\nideal of the past, whether of our own past lives or of former states of\\nsociety, has a singular fascination for the minds of many. too late we\\nlearn that such ideals cannot be recalled, though the recollection of\\nthem may have a humanizing influence on other times. but the\\nabstractions of philosophy are to most persons cold and vacant; they\\ngive light without warmth; they are like the full moon in the heavens\\nwhen there are no stars appearing. men cannot live by thought alone;\\nthe world of sense is always breaking in upon them. they are for the\\nmost part confined to a corner of earth, and see but a little way\\nbeyond their own home or place of abode; they ‘do not lift up their\\neyes to the hills’; they are not awake when the dawn appears. but in\\nplato we have reached a height from which a man may look into the\\ndistance and behold the future of the world and of philosophy. the\\nideal of the state and of the life of the philosopher; the ideal of an\\neducation continuing through life and extending equally to both sexes;\\nthe ideal of the unity and correlation of knowledge; the faith in good\\nand immortality—are the vacant forms of light on which plato is seeking\\nto fix the eye of mankind.\\n\\n8. two other ideals, which never appeared above the horizon in greek\\nphilosophy, float before the minds of men in our own day: one seen more\\nclearly than formerly, as though each year and each generation brought\\nus nearer to some great change; the other almost in the same degree\\nretiring from view behind the laws of nature, as if oppressed by them,\\nbut still remaining a silent hope of we know not what hidden in the\\nheart of man. the first ideal is the future of the human race in this\\nworld; the second the future of the individual in another. the first is\\nthe more perfect realization of our own present life; the second, the\\nabnegation of it: the one, limited by experience, the other,\\ntranscending it. both of them have been and are powerful motives of\\naction; there are a few in whom they have taken the place of all\\nearthly interests. the hope of a future for the human race at first\\nsight seems to be the more disinterested, the hope of individual\\nexistence the more egotistical, of the two motives. but when men have\\nlearned to resolve their hope of a future either for themselves or for\\nthe world into the will of god—‘not my will but thine,’ the difference\\nbetween them falls away; and they may be allowed to make either of them\\nthe basis of their lives, according to their own individual character\\nor temperament. there is as much faith in the willingness to work for\\nan unseen future in this world as in another. neither is it\\ninconceivable that some rare nature may feel his duty to another\\ngeneration, or to another century, almost as strongly as to his own, or\\nthat living always in the presence of god, he may realize another world\\nas vividly as he does this.\\n\\nthe greatest of all ideals may, or rather must be conceived by us under\\nsimilitudes derived from human qualities; although sometimes, like the\\njewish prophets, we may dash away these figures of speech and describe\\nthe nature of god only in negatives. these again by degrees acquire a\\npositive meaning. it would be well, if when meditating on the higher\\ntruths either of philosophy or religion, we sometimes substituted one\\nform of expression for another, lest through the necessities of\\nlanguage we should become the slaves of mere words.\\n\\nthere is a third ideal, not the same, but akin to these, which has a\\nplace in the home and heart of every believer in the religion of\\nchrist, and in which men seem to find a nearer and more familiar truth,\\nthe divine man, the son of man, the saviour of mankind, who is the\\nfirst-born and head of the whole family in heaven and earth, in whom\\nthe divine and human, that which is without and that which is within\\nthe range of our earthly faculties, are indissolubly united. neither is\\nthis divine form of goodness wholly separable from the ideal of the\\nchristian church, which is said in the new testament to be ‘his body,’\\nor at variance with those other images of good which plato sets before\\nus. we see him in a figure only, and of figures of speech we select but\\na few, and those the simplest, to be the expression of him. we behold\\nhim in a picture, but he is not there. we gather up the fragments of\\nhis discourses, but neither do they represent him as he truly was. his\\ndwelling is neither in heaven nor earth, but in the heart of man. this\\nis that image which plato saw dimly in the distance, which, when\\nexisting among men, he called, in the language of homer, ‘the likeness\\nof god,’ the likeness of a nature which in all ages men have felt to be\\ngreater and better than themselves, and which in endless forms, whether\\nderived from scripture or nature, from the witness of history or from\\nthe human heart, regarded as a person or not as a person, with or\\nwithout parts or passions, existing in space or not in space, is and\\nwill always continue to be to mankind the idea of good.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n the republic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n persons of the dialogue.\\n\\n\\nsocrates, who is the narrator.\\n\\nglaucon.\\n\\nadeimantus.\\n\\npolemarchus.\\n\\ncephalus.\\n\\nthrasymachus.\\n\\ncleitophon.\\n\\nand others who are mute auditors.\\n\\nthe scene is laid in the house of cephalus at the piraeus; and the\\nwhole dialogue is narrated by socrates the day after it actually took\\nplace to timaeus, hermocrates, critias, and a nameless person, who are\\nintroduced in the timaeus.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book i.\\n\\n\\ni went down yesterday to the piraeus with glaucon the son of ariston,\\nthat i might offer up my prayers to the goddess (bendis, the thracian\\nartemis.); and also because i wanted to see in what manner they would\\ncelebrate the festival, which was a new thing. i was delighted with the\\nprocession of the inhabitants; but that of the thracians was equally,\\nif not more, beautiful. when we had finished our prayers and viewed the\\nspectacle, we turned in the direction of the city; and at that instant\\npolemarchus the son of cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a\\ndistance as we were starting on our way home, and told his servant to\\nrun and bid us wait for him. the servant took hold of me by the cloak\\nbehind, and said: polemarchus desires you to wait.\\n\\ni turned round, and asked him where his master was.\\n\\nthere he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only wait.\\n\\ncertainly we will, said glaucon; and in a few minutes polemarchus\\nappeared, and with him adeimantus, glaucon’s brother, niceratus the son\\nof nicias, and several others who had been at the procession.\\n\\npolemarchus said to me: i perceive, socrates, that you and your\\ncompanion are already on your way to the city.\\n\\nyou are not far wrong, i said.\\n\\nbut do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nand are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to\\nremain where you are.\\n\\nmay there not be the alternative, i said, that we may persuade you to\\nlet us go?\\n\\nbut can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he said.\\n\\ncertainly not, replied glaucon.\\n\\nthen we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.\\n\\nadeimantus added: has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback in\\nhonour of the goddess which will take place in the evening?\\n\\nwith horses! i replied: that is a novelty. will horsemen carry torches\\nand pass them one to another during the race?\\n\\nyes, said polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will be\\ncelebrated at night, which you certainly ought to see. let us rise soon\\nafter supper and see this festival; there will be a gathering of young\\nmen, and we will have a good talk. stay then, and do not be perverse.\\n\\nglaucon said: i suppose, since you insist, that we must.\\n\\nvery good, i replied.\\n\\naccordingly we went with polemarchus to his house; and there we found\\nhis brothers lysias and euthydemus, and with them thrasymachus the\\nchalcedonian, charmantides the paeanian, and cleitophon the son of\\naristonymus. there too was cephalus the father of polemarchus, whom i\\nhad not seen for a long time, and i thought him very much aged. he was\\nseated on a cushioned chair, and had a garland on his head, for he had\\nbeen sacrificing in the court; and there were some other chairs in the\\nroom arranged in a semicircle, upon which we sat down by him. he\\nsaluted me eagerly, and then he said:—\\n\\nyou don’t come to see me, socrates, as often as you ought: if i were\\nstill able to go and see you i would not ask you to come to me. but at\\nmy age i can hardly get to the city, and therefore you should come\\noftener to the piraeus. for let me tell you, that the more the\\npleasures of the body fade away, the greater to me is the pleasure and\\ncharm of conversation. do not then deny my request, but make our house\\nyour resort and keep company with these young men; we are old friends,\\nand you will be quite at home with us.\\n\\ni replied: there is nothing which for my part i like better, cephalus,\\nthan conversing with aged men; for i regard them as travellers who have\\ngone a journey which i too may have to go, and of whom i ought to\\nenquire, whether the way is smooth and easy, or rugged and difficult.\\nand this is a question which i should like to ask of you who have\\narrived at that time which the poets call the ‘threshold of old age’—is\\nlife harder towards the end, or what report do you give of it?\\n\\ni will tell you, socrates, he said, what my own feeling is. men of my\\nage flock together; we are birds of a feather, as the old proverb says;\\nand at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is—i cannot\\neat, i cannot drink; the pleasures of youth and love are fled away:\\nthere was a good time once, but now that is gone, and life is no longer\\nlife. some complain of the slights which are put upon them by\\nrelations, and they will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age\\nis the cause. but to me, socrates, these complainers seem to blame that\\nwhich is not really in fault. for if old age were the cause, i too\\nbeing old, and every other old man, would have felt as they do. but\\nthis is not my own experience, nor that of others whom i have known.\\nhow well i remember the aged poet sophocles, when in answer to the\\nquestion, how does love suit with age, sophocles,—are you still the man\\nyou were? peace, he replied; most gladly have i escaped the thing of\\nwhich you speak; i feel as if i had escaped from a mad and furious\\nmaster. his words have often occurred to my mind since, and they seem\\nas good to me now as at the time when he uttered them. for certainly\\nold age has a great sense of calm and freedom; when the passions relax\\ntheir hold, then, as sophocles says, we are freed from the grasp not of\\none mad master only, but of many. the truth is, socrates, that these\\nregrets, and also the complaints about relations, are to be attributed\\nto the same cause, which is not old age, but men’s characters and\\ntempers; for he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the\\npressure of age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and\\nage are equally a burden.\\n\\ni listened in admiration, and wanting to draw him out, that he might go\\non—yes, cephalus, i said: but i rather suspect that people in general\\nare not convinced by you when you speak thus; they think that old age\\nsits lightly upon you, not because of your happy disposition, but\\nbecause you are rich, and wealth is well known to be a great comforter.\\n\\nyou are right, he replied; they are not convinced: and there is\\nsomething in what they say; not, however, so much as they imagine. i\\nmight answer them as themistocles answered the seriphian who was\\nabusing him and saying that he was famous, not for his own merits but\\nbecause he was an athenian: ‘if you had been a native of my country or\\ni of yours, neither of us would have been famous.’ and to those who are\\nnot rich and are impatient of old age, the same reply may be made; for\\nto the good poor man old age cannot be a light burden, nor can a bad\\nrich man ever have peace with himself.\\n\\nmay i ask, cephalus, whether your fortune was for the most part\\ninherited or acquired by you?\\n\\nacquired! socrates; do you want to know how much i acquired? in the art\\nof making money i have been midway between my father and grandfather:\\nfor my grandfather, whose name i bear, doubled and trebled the value of\\nhis patrimony, that which he inherited being much what i possess now;\\nbut my father lysanias reduced the property below what it is at\\npresent: and i shall be satisfied if i leave to these my sons not less\\nbut a little more than i received.\\n\\nthat was why i asked you the question, i replied, because i see that\\nyou are indifferent about money, which is a characteristic rather of\\nthose who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired\\nthem; the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation\\nof their own, resembling the affection of authors for their own poems,\\nor of parents for their children, besides that natural love of it for\\nthe sake of use and profit which is common to them and all men. and\\nhence they are very bad company, for they can talk about nothing but\\nthe praises of wealth.\\n\\nthat is true, he said.\\n\\nyes, that is very true, but may i ask another question?—what do you\\nconsider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your\\nwealth?\\n\\none, he said, of which i could not expect easily to convince others.\\nfor let me tell you, socrates, that when a man thinks himself to be\\nnear death, fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had\\nbefore; the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted\\nthere of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him, but now he\\nis tormented with the thought that they may be true: either from the\\nweakness of age, or because he is now drawing nearer to that other\\nplace, he has a clearer view of these things; suspicions and alarms\\ncrowd thickly upon him, and he begins to reflect and consider what\\nwrongs he has done to others. and when he finds that the sum of his\\ntransgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up in\\nhis sleep for fear, and he is filled with dark forebodings. but to him\\nwho is conscious of no sin, sweet hope, as pindar charmingly says, is\\nthe kind nurse of his age:\\n\\n‘hope,’ he says, ‘cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice and\\nholiness, and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his\\njourney;—hope which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man.’\\n\\nhow admirable are his words! and the great blessing of riches, i do not\\nsay to every man, but to a good man, is, that he has had no occasion to\\ndeceive or to defraud others, either intentionally or unintentionally;\\nand when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension\\nabout offerings due to the gods or debts which he owes to men. now to\\nthis peace of mind the possession of wealth greatly contributes; and\\ntherefore i say, that, setting one thing against another, of the many\\nadvantages which wealth has to give, to a man of sense this is in my\\nopinion the greatest.\\n\\nwell said, cephalus, i replied; but as concerning justice, what is\\nit?—to speak the truth and to pay your debts—no more than this? and\\neven to this are there not exceptions? suppose that a friend when in\\nhis right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he\\nis not in his right mind, ought i to give them back to him? no one\\nwould say that i ought or that i should be right in doing so, any more\\nthan they would say that i ought always to speak the truth to one who\\nis in his condition.\\n\\nyou are quite right, he replied.\\n\\nbut then, i said, speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a\\ncorrect definition of justice.\\n\\nquite correct, socrates, if simonides is to be believed, said\\npolemarchus interposing.\\n\\ni fear, said cephalus, that i must go now, for i have to look after the\\nsacrifices, and i hand over the argument to polemarchus and the\\ncompany.\\n\\nis not polemarchus your heir? i said.\\n\\nto be sure, he answered, and went away laughing to the sacrifices.\\n\\ntell me then, o thou heir of the argument, what did simonides say, and\\naccording to you truly say, about justice?\\n\\nhe said that the repayment of a debt is just, and in saying so he\\nappears to me to be right.\\n\\ni should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired man,\\nbut his meaning, though probably clear to you, is the reverse of clear\\nto me. for he certainly does not mean, as we were just now saying, that\\ni ought to return a deposit of arms or of anything else to one who asks\\nfor it when he is not in his right senses; and yet a deposit cannot be\\ndenied to be a debt.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthen when the person who asks me is not in his right mind i am by no\\nmeans to make the return?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nwhen simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice, he did\\nnot mean to include that case?\\n\\ncertainly not; for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good to a\\nfriend and never evil.\\n\\nyou mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury of\\nthe receiver, if the two parties are friends, is not the repayment of a\\ndebt,—that is what you would imagine him to say?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?\\n\\nto be sure, he said, they are to receive what we owe them, and an\\nenemy, as i take it, owes to an enemy that which is due or proper to\\nhim—that is to say, evil.\\n\\nsimonides, then, after the manner of poets, would seem to have spoken\\ndarkly of the nature of justice; for he really meant to say that\\njustice is the giving to each man what is proper to him, and this he\\ntermed a debt.\\n\\nthat must have been his meaning, he said.\\n\\nby heaven! i replied; and if we asked him what due or proper thing is\\ngiven by medicine, and to whom, what answer do you think that he would\\nmake to us?\\n\\nhe would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink to\\nhuman bodies.\\n\\nand what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?\\n\\nseasoning to food.\\n\\nand what is that which justice gives, and to whom?\\n\\nif, socrates, we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the\\npreceding instances, then justice is the art which gives good to\\nfriends and evil to enemies.\\n\\nthat is his meaning then?\\n\\ni think so.\\n\\nand who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies\\nin time of sickness?\\n\\nthe physician.\\n\\nor when they are on a voyage, amid the perils of the sea?\\n\\nthe pilot.\\n\\nand in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just\\nman most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friend?\\n\\nin going to war against the one and in making alliances with the other.\\n\\nbut when a man is well, my dear polemarchus, there is no need of a\\nphysician?\\n\\nno.\\n\\nand he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?\\n\\nno.\\n\\nthen in time of peace justice will be of no use?\\n\\ni am very far from thinking so.\\n\\nyou think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nlike husbandry for the acquisition of corn?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nor like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes,—that is what you mean?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of\\npeace?\\n\\nin contracts, socrates, justice is of use.\\n\\nand by contracts you mean partnerships?\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nbut is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better\\npartner at a game of draughts?\\n\\nthe skilful player.\\n\\nand in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful or\\nbetter partner than the builder?\\n\\nquite the reverse.\\n\\nthen in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than\\nthe harp-player, as in playing the harp the harp-player is certainly a\\nbetter partner than the just man?\\n\\nin a money partnership.\\n\\nyes, polemarchus, but surely not in the use of money; for you do not\\nwant a just man to be your counsellor in the purchase or sale of a\\nhorse; a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that,\\nwould he not?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would be\\nbetter?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthen what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man is\\nto be preferred?\\n\\nwhen you want a deposit to be kept safely.\\n\\nyou mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie?\\n\\nprecisely.\\n\\nthat is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?\\n\\nthat is the inference.\\n\\nand when you want to keep a pruning-hook safe, then justice is useful\\nto the individual and to the state; but when you want to use it, then\\nthe art of the vine-dresser?\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nand when you want to keep a shield or a lyre, and not to use them, you\\nwould say that justice is useful; but when you want to use them, then\\nthe art of the soldier or of the musician?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand so of all other things;—justice is useful when they are useless,\\nand useless when they are useful?\\n\\nthat is the inference.\\n\\nthen justice is not good for much. but let us consider this further\\npoint: is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in any\\nkind of fighting best able to ward off a blow?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is\\nbest able to create one?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a march\\nupon the enemy?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nthen he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief?\\n\\nthat, i suppose, is to be inferred.\\n\\nthen if the just man is good at keeping money, he is good at stealing\\nit.\\n\\nthat is implied in the argument.\\n\\nthen after all the just man has turned out to be a thief. and this is a\\nlesson which i suspect you must have learnt out of homer; for he,\\nspeaking of autolycus, the maternal grandfather of odysseus, who is a\\nfavourite of his, affirms that\\n\\n‘he was excellent above all men in theft and perjury.’\\n\\nand so, you and homer and simonides are agreed that justice is an art\\nof theft; to be practised however ‘for the good of friends and for the\\nharm of enemies,’—that was what you were saying?\\n\\nno, certainly not that, though i do not now know what i did say; but i\\nstill stand by the latter words.\\n\\nwell, there is another question: by friends and enemies do we mean\\nthose who are so really, or only in seeming?\\n\\nsurely, he said, a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks\\ngood, and to hate those whom he thinks evil.\\n\\nyes, but do not persons often err about good and evil: many who are not\\ngood seem to be so, and conversely?\\n\\nthat is true.\\n\\nthen to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their\\nfriends? true.\\n\\nand in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil\\nto the good?\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nbut the good are just and would not do an injustice?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthen according to your argument it is just to injure those who do no\\nwrong?\\n\\nnay, socrates; the doctrine is immoral.\\n\\nthen i suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the\\nunjust?\\n\\ni like that better.\\n\\nbut see the consequence:—many a man who is ignorant of human nature has\\nfriends who are bad friends, and in that case he ought to do harm to\\nthem; and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit; but, if so, we\\nshall be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be the\\nmeaning of simonides.\\n\\nvery true, he said: and i think that we had better correct an error\\ninto which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words ‘friend’ and\\n‘enemy.’\\n\\nwhat was the error, polemarchus? i asked.\\n\\nwe assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought good.\\n\\nand how is the error to be corrected?\\n\\nwe should rather say that he is a friend who is, as well as seems,\\ngood; and that he who seems only, and is not good, only seems to be and\\nis not a friend; and of an enemy the same may be said.\\n\\nyou would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it is just to do\\ngood to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should further say: it\\nis just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our\\nenemies when they are evil?\\n\\nyes, that appears to me to be the truth.\\n\\nbut ought the just to injure any one at all?\\n\\nundoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his\\nenemies.\\n\\nwhen horses are injured, are they improved or deteriorated?\\n\\nthe latter.\\n\\ndeteriorated, that is to say, in the good qualities of horses, not of\\ndogs?\\n\\nyes, of horses.\\n\\nand dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not of\\nhorses?\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nand will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is the\\nproper virtue of man?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand that human virtue is justice?\\n\\nto be sure.\\n\\nthen men who are injured are of necessity made unjust?\\n\\nthat is the result.\\n\\nbut can the musician by his art make men unmusical?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nor the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen?\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nand can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking generally, can\\nthe good by virtue make them bad?\\n\\nassuredly not.\\n\\nany more than heat can produce cold?\\n\\nit cannot.\\n\\nor drought moisture?\\n\\nclearly not.\\n\\nnor can the good harm any one?\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nand the just is the good?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nthen to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man,\\nbut of the opposite, who is the unjust?\\n\\ni think that what you say is quite true, socrates.\\n\\nthen if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts, and\\nthat good is the debt which a just man owes to his friends, and evil\\nthe debt which he owes to his enemies,—to say this is not wise; for it\\nis not true, if, as has been clearly shown, the injuring of another can\\nbe in no case just.\\n\\ni agree with you, said polemarchus.\\n\\nthen you and i are prepared to take up arms against any one who\\nattributes such a saying to simonides or bias or pittacus, or any other\\nwise man or seer?\\n\\ni am quite ready to do battle at your side, he said.\\n\\nshall i tell you whose i believe the saying to be?\\n\\nwhose?\\n\\ni believe that periander or perdiccas or xerxes or ismenias the theban,\\nor some other rich and mighty man, who had a great opinion of his own\\npower, was the first to say that justice is ‘doing good to your friends\\nand harm to your enemies.’\\n\\nmost true, he said.\\n\\nyes, i said; but if this definition of justice also breaks down, what\\nother can be offered?\\n\\nseveral times in the course of the discussion thrasymachus had made an\\nattempt to get the argument into his own hands, and had been put down\\nby the rest of the company, who wanted to hear the end. but when\\npolemarchus and i had done speaking and there was a pause, he could no\\nlonger hold his peace; and, gathering himself up, he came at us like a\\nwild beast, seeking to devour us. we were quite panic-stricken at the\\nsight of him.\\n\\nhe roared out to the whole company: what folly, socrates, has taken\\npossession of you all? and why, sillybillies, do you knock under to one\\nanother? i say that if you want really to know what justice is, you\\nshould not only ask but answer, and you should not seek honour to\\nyourself from the refutation of an opponent, but have your own answer;\\nfor there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer. and now i will\\nnot have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit or gain or\\ninterest, for this sort of nonsense will not do for me; i must have\\nclearness and accuracy.\\n\\ni was panic-stricken at his words, and could not look at him without\\ntrembling. indeed i believe that if i had not fixed my eye upon him, i\\nshould have been struck dumb: but when i saw his fury rising, i looked\\nat him first, and was therefore able to reply to him.\\n\\nthrasymachus, i said, with a quiver, don’t be hard upon us. polemarchus\\nand i may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument, but i\\ncan assure you that the error was not intentional. if we were seeking\\nfor a piece of gold, you would not imagine that we were ‘knocking under\\nto one another,’ and so losing our chance of finding it. and why, when\\nwe are seeking for justice, a thing more precious than many pieces of\\ngold, do you say that we are weakly yielding to one another and not\\ndoing our utmost to get at the truth? nay, my good friend, we are most\\nwilling and anxious to do so, but the fact is that we cannot. and if\\nso, you people who know all things should pity us and not be angry with\\nus.\\n\\nhow characteristic of socrates! he replied, with a bitter laugh;—that’s\\nyour ironical style! did i not foresee—have i not already told you,\\nthat whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer, and try irony or\\nany other shuffle, in order that he might avoid answering?\\n\\nyou are a philosopher, thrasymachus, i replied, and well know that if\\nyou ask a person what numbers make up twelve, taking care to prohibit\\nhim whom you ask from answering twice six, or three times four, or six\\ntimes two, or four times three, ‘for this sort of nonsense will not do\\nfor me,’—then obviously, if that is your way of putting the question,\\nno one can answer you. but suppose that he were to retort,\\n‘thrasymachus, what do you mean? if one of these numbers which you\\ninterdict be the true answer to the question, am i falsely to say some\\nother number which is not the right one?—is that your meaning?’—how\\nwould you answer him?\\n\\njust as if the two cases were at all alike! he said.\\n\\nwhy should they not be? i replied; and even if they are not, but only\\nappear to be so to the person who is asked, ought he not to say what he\\nthinks, whether you and i forbid him or not?\\n\\ni presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted\\nanswers?\\n\\ni dare say that i may, notwithstanding the danger, if upon reflection i\\napprove of any of them.\\n\\nbut what if i give you an answer about justice other and better, he\\nsaid, than any of these? what do you deserve to have done to you?\\n\\ndone to me!—as becomes the ignorant, i must learn from the wise—that is\\nwhat i deserve to have done to me.\\n\\nwhat, and no payment! a pleasant notion!\\n\\ni will pay when i have the money, i replied.\\n\\nbut you have, socrates, said glaucon: and you, thrasymachus, need be\\nunder no anxiety about money, for we will all make a contribution for\\nsocrates.\\n\\nyes, he replied, and then socrates will do as he always does—refuse to\\nanswer himself, but take and pull to pieces the answer of some one\\nelse.\\n\\nwhy, my good friend, i said, how can any one answer who knows, and says\\nthat he knows, just nothing; and who, even if he has some faint notions\\nof his own, is told by a man of authority not to utter them? the\\nnatural thing is, that the speaker should be some one like yourself who\\nprofesses to know and can tell what he knows. will you then kindly\\nanswer, for the edification of the company and of myself?\\n\\nglaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request, and\\nthrasymachus, as any one might see, was in reality eager to speak; for\\nhe thought that he had an excellent answer, and would distinguish\\nhimself. but at first he affected to insist on my answering; at length\\nhe consented to begin. behold, he said, the wisdom of socrates; he\\nrefuses to teach himself, and goes about learning of others, to whom he\\nnever even says thank you.\\n\\nthat i learn of others, i replied, is quite true; but that i am\\nungrateful i wholly deny. money i have none, and therefore i pay in\\npraise, which is all i have; and how ready i am to praise any one who\\nappears to me to speak well you will very soon find out when you\\nanswer; for i expect that you will answer well.\\n\\nlisten, then, he said; i proclaim that justice is nothing else than the\\ninterest of the stronger. and now why do you not praise me? but of\\ncourse you won’t.\\n\\nlet me first understand you, i replied. justice, as you say, is the\\ninterest of the stronger. what, thrasymachus, is the meaning of this?\\nyou cannot mean to say that because polydamas, the pancratiast, is\\nstronger than we are, and finds the eating of beef conducive to his\\nbodily strength, that to eat beef is therefore equally for our good who\\nare weaker than he is, and right and just for us?\\n\\nthat’s abominable of you, socrates; you take the words in the sense\\nwhich is most damaging to the argument.\\n\\nnot at all, my good sir, i said; i am trying to understand them; and i\\nwish that you would be a little clearer.\\n\\nwell, he said, have you never heard that forms of government differ;\\nthere are tyrannies, and there are democracies, and there are\\naristocracies?\\n\\nyes, i know.\\n\\nand the government is the ruling power in each state?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand the different forms of government make laws democratical,\\naristocratical, tyrannical, with a view to their several interests; and\\nthese laws, which are made by them for their own interests, are the\\njustice which they deliver to their subjects, and him who transgresses\\nthem they punish as a breaker of the law, and unjust. and that is what\\ni mean when i say that in all states there is the same principle of\\njustice, which is the interest of the government; and as the government\\nmust be supposed to have power, the only reasonable conclusion is, that\\neverywhere there is one principle of justice, which is the interest of\\nthe stronger.\\n\\nnow i understand you, i said; and whether you are right or not i will\\ntry to discover. but let me remark, that in defining justice you have\\nyourself used the word ‘interest’ which you forbade me to use. it is\\ntrue, however, that in your definition the words ‘of the stronger’ are\\nadded.\\n\\na small addition, you must allow, he said.\\n\\ngreat or small, never mind about that: we must first enquire whether\\nwhat you are saying is the truth. now we are both agreed that justice\\nis interest of some sort, but you go on to say ‘of the stronger’; about\\nthis addition i am not so sure, and must therefore consider further.\\n\\nproceed.\\n\\ni will; and first tell me, do you admit that it is just for subjects to\\nobey their rulers?\\n\\ni do.\\n\\nbut are the rulers of states absolutely infallible, or are they\\nsometimes liable to err?\\n\\nto be sure, he replied, they are liable to err.\\n\\nthen in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly, and\\nsometimes not?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nwhen they make them rightly, they make them agreeably to their\\ninterest; when they are mistaken, contrary to their interest; you admit\\nthat?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects,—and that\\nis what you call justice?\\n\\ndoubtless.\\n\\nthen justice, according to your argument, is not only obedience to the\\ninterest of the stronger but the reverse?\\n\\nwhat is that you are saying? he asked.\\n\\ni am only repeating what you are saying, i believe. but let us\\nconsider: have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about\\ntheir own interest in what they command, and also that to obey them is\\njustice? has not that been admitted?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthen you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest\\nof the stronger, when the rulers unintentionally command things to be\\ndone which are to their own injury. for if, as you say, justice is the\\nobedience which the subject renders to their commands, in that case, o\\nwisest of men, is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker\\nare commanded to do, not what is for the interest, but what is for the\\ninjury of the stronger?\\n\\nnothing can be clearer, socrates, said polemarchus.\\n\\nyes, said cleitophon, interposing, if you are allowed to be his\\nwitness.\\n\\nbut there is no need of any witness, said polemarchus, for thrasymachus\\nhimself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for\\ntheir own interest, and that for subjects to obey them is justice.\\n\\nyes, polemarchus,—thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what was\\ncommanded by their rulers is just.\\n\\nyes, cleitophon, but he also said that justice is the interest of the\\nstronger, and, while admitting both these propositions, he further\\nacknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his\\nsubjects to do what is not for his own interest; whence follows that\\njustice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger.\\n\\nbut, said cleitophon, he meant by the interest of the stronger what the\\nstronger thought to be his interest,—this was what the weaker had to\\ndo; and this was affirmed by him to be justice.\\n\\nthose were not his words, rejoined polemarchus.\\n\\nnever mind, i replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept his\\nstatement. tell me, thrasymachus, i said, did you mean by justice what\\nthe stronger thought to be his interest, whether really so or not?\\n\\ncertainly not, he said. do you suppose that i call him who is mistaken\\nthe stronger at the time when he is mistaken?\\n\\nyes, i said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted that\\nthe ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken.\\n\\nyou argue like an informer, socrates. do you mean, for example, that he\\nwho is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken?\\nor that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or\\ngrammarian at the time when he is making the mistake, in respect of the\\nmistake? true, we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian\\nhas made a mistake, but this is only a way of speaking; for the fact is\\nthat neither the grammarian nor any other person of skill ever makes a\\nmistake in so far as he is what his name implies; they none of them err\\nunless their skill fails them, and then they cease to be skilled\\nartists. no artist or sage or ruler errs at the time when he is what\\nhis name implies; though he is commonly said to err, and i adopted the\\ncommon mode of speaking. but to be perfectly accurate, since you are\\nsuch a lover of accuracy, we should say that the ruler, in so far as he\\nis a ruler, is unerring, and, being unerring, always commands that\\nwhich is for his own interest; and the subject is required to execute\\nhis commands; and therefore, as i said at first and now repeat, justice\\nis the interest of the stronger.\\n\\nindeed, thrasymachus, and do i really appear to you to argue like an\\ninformer?\\n\\ncertainly, he replied.\\n\\nand do you suppose that i ask these questions with any design of\\ninjuring you in the argument?\\n\\nnay, he replied, ‘suppose’ is not the word—i know it; but you will be\\nfound out, and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail.\\n\\ni shall not make the attempt, my dear man; but to avoid any\\nmisunderstanding occurring between us in future, let me ask, in what\\nsense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest, as you were\\nsaying, he being the superior, it is just that the inferior should\\nexecute—is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict sense of the\\nterm?\\n\\nin the strictest of all senses, he said. and now cheat and play the\\ninformer if you can; i ask no quarter at your hands. but you never will\\nbe able, never.\\n\\nand do you imagine, i said, that i am such a madman as to try and\\ncheat, thrasymachus? i might as well shave a lion.\\n\\nwhy, he said, you made the attempt a minute ago, and you failed.\\n\\nenough, i said, of these civilities. it will be better that i should\\nask you a question: is the physician, taken in that strict sense of\\nwhich you are speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of money? and\\nremember that i am now speaking of the true physician.\\n\\na healer of the sick, he replied.\\n\\nand the pilot—that is to say, the true pilot—is he a captain of sailors\\nor a mere sailor?\\n\\na captain of sailors.\\n\\nthe circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into\\naccount; neither is he to be called a sailor; the name pilot by which\\nhe is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing, but is significant\\nof his skill and of his authority over the sailors.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nnow, i said, every art has an interest?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nfor which the art has to consider and provide?\\n\\nyes, that is the aim of art.\\n\\nand the interest of any art is the perfection of it—this and nothing\\nelse?\\n\\nwhat do you mean?\\n\\ni mean what i may illustrate negatively by the example of the body.\\nsuppose you were to ask me whether the body is self-sufficing or has\\nwants, i should reply: certainly the body has wants; for the body may\\nbe ill and require to be cured, and has therefore interests to which\\nthe art of medicine ministers; and this is the origin and intention of\\nmedicine, as you will acknowledge. am i not right?\\n\\nquite right, he replied.\\n\\nbut is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in any\\nquality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the\\near fail of hearing, and therefore requires another art to provide for\\nthe interests of seeing and hearing—has art in itself, i say, any\\nsimilar liability to fault or defect, and does every art require\\nanother supplementary art to provide for its interests, and that\\nanother and another without end? or have the arts to look only after\\ntheir own interests? or have they no need either of themselves or of\\nanother?—having no faults or defects, they have no need to correct\\nthem, either by the exercise of their own art or of any other; they\\nhave only to consider the interest of their subject-matter. for every\\nart remains pure and faultless while remaining true—that is to say,\\nwhile perfect and unimpaired. take the words in your precise sense, and\\ntell me whether i am not right.\\n\\nyes, clearly.\\n\\nthen medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, but the\\ninterest of the body?\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nnor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art of\\nhorsemanship, but the interests of the horse; neither do any other arts\\ncare for themselves, for they have no needs; they care only for that\\nwhich is the subject of their art?\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nbut surely, thrasymachus, the arts are the superiors and rulers of\\ntheir own subjects?\\n\\nto this he assented with a good deal of reluctance.\\n\\nthen, i said, no science or art considers or enjoins the interest of\\nthe stronger or superior, but only the interest of the subject and\\nweaker?\\n\\nhe made an attempt to contest this proposition also, but finally\\nacquiesced.\\n\\nthen, i continued, no physician, in so far as he is a physician,\\nconsiders his own good in what he prescribes, but the good of his\\npatient; for the true physician is also a ruler having the human body\\nas a subject, and is not a mere money-maker; that has been admitted?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand the pilot likewise, in the strict sense of the term, is a ruler of\\nsailors and not a mere sailor?\\n\\nthat has been admitted.\\n\\nand such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest\\nof the sailor who is under him, and not for his own or the ruler’s\\ninterest?\\n\\nhe gave a reluctant ‘yes.’\\n\\nthen, i said, thrasymachus, there is no one in any rule who, in so far\\nas he is a ruler, considers or enjoins what is for his own interest,\\nbut always what is for the interest of his subject or suitable to his\\nart; to that he looks, and that alone he considers in everything which\\nhe says and does.\\n\\nwhen we had got to this point in the argument, and every one saw that\\nthe definition of justice had been completely upset, thrasymachus,\\ninstead of replying to me, said: tell me, socrates, have you got a\\nnurse?\\n\\nwhy do you ask such a question, i said, when you ought rather to be\\nanswering?\\n\\nbecause she leaves you to snivel, and never wipes your nose: she has\\nnot even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep.\\n\\nwhat makes you say that? i replied.\\n\\nbecause you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens or tends the\\nsheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of\\nhimself or his master; and you further imagine that the rulers of\\nstates, if they are true rulers, never think of their subjects as\\nsheep, and that they are not studying their own advantage day and\\nnight. oh, no; and so entirely astray are you in your ideas about the\\njust and unjust as not even to know that justice and the just are in\\nreality another’s good; that is to say, the interest of the ruler and\\nstronger, and the loss of the subject and servant; and injustice the\\nopposite; for the unjust is lord over the truly simple and just: he is\\nthe stronger, and his subjects do what is for his interest, and\\nminister to his happiness, which is very far from being their own.\\nconsider further, most foolish socrates, that the just is always a\\nloser in comparison with the unjust. first of all, in private\\ncontracts: wherever the unjust is the partner of the just you will find\\nthat, when the partnership is dissolved, the unjust man has always more\\nand the just less. secondly, in their dealings with the state: when\\nthere is an income-tax, the just man will pay more and the unjust less\\non the same amount of income; and when there is anything to be received\\nthe one gains nothing and the other much. observe also what happens\\nwhen they take an office; there is the just man neglecting his affairs\\nand perhaps suffering other losses, and getting nothing out of the\\npublic, because he is just; moreover he is hated by his friends and\\nacquaintance for refusing to serve them in unlawful ways. but all this\\nis reversed in the case of the unjust man. i am speaking, as before, of\\ninjustice on a large scale in which the advantage of the unjust is most\\napparent; and my meaning will be most clearly seen if we turn to that\\nhighest form of injustice in which the criminal is the happiest of men,\\nand the sufferers or those who refuse to do injustice are the most\\nmiserable—that is to say tyranny, which by fraud and force takes away\\nthe property of others, not little by little but wholesale;\\ncomprehending in one, things sacred as well as profane, private and\\npublic; for which acts of wrong, if he were detected perpetrating any\\none of them singly, he would be punished and incur great disgrace—they\\nwho do such wrong in particular cases are called robbers of temples,\\nand man-stealers and burglars and swindlers and thieves. but when a man\\nbesides taking away the money of the citizens has made slaves of them,\\nthen, instead of these names of reproach, he is termed happy and\\nblessed, not only by the citizens but by all who hear of his having\\nachieved the consummation of injustice. for mankind censure injustice,\\nfearing that they may be the victims of it and not because they shrink\\nfrom committing it. and thus, as i have shown, socrates, injustice,\\nwhen on a sufficient scale, has more strength and freedom and mastery\\nthan justice; and, as i said at first, justice is the interest of the\\nstronger, whereas injustice is a man’s own profit and interest.\\n\\nthrasymachus, when he had thus spoken, having, like a bath-man, deluged\\nour ears with his words, had a mind to go away. but the company would\\nnot let him; they insisted that he should remain and defend his\\nposition; and i myself added my own humble request that he would not\\nleave us. thrasymachus, i said to him, excellent man, how suggestive\\nare your remarks! and are you going to run away before you have fairly\\ntaught or learned whether they are true or not? is the attempt to\\ndetermine the way of man’s life so small a matter in your eyes—to\\ndetermine how life may be passed by each one of us to the greatest\\nadvantage?\\n\\nand do i differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the enquiry?\\n\\nyou appear rather, i replied, to have no care or thought about us,\\nthrasymachus—whether we live better or worse from not knowing what you\\nsay you know, is to you a matter of indifference. prithee, friend, do\\nnot keep your knowledge to yourself; we are a large party; and any\\nbenefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded. for my own\\npart i openly declare that i am not convinced, and that i do not\\nbelieve injustice to be more gainful than justice, even if uncontrolled\\nand allowed to have free play. for, granting that there may be an\\nunjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraud or force,\\nstill this does not convince me of the superior advantage of injustice,\\nand there may be others who are in the same predicament with myself.\\nperhaps we may be wrong; if so, you in your wisdom should convince us\\nthat we are mistaken in preferring justice to injustice.\\n\\nand how am i to convince you, he said, if you are not already convinced\\nby what i have just said; what more can i do for you? would you have me\\nput the proof bodily into your souls?\\n\\nheaven forbid! i said; i would only ask you to be consistent; or, if\\nyou change, change openly and let there be no deception. for i must\\nremark, thrasymachus, if you will recall what was previously said, that\\nalthough you began by defining the true physician in an exact sense,\\nyou did not observe a like exactness when speaking of the shepherd; you\\nthought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends the sheep not with a view\\nto their own good, but like a mere diner or banquetter with a view to\\nthe pleasures of the table; or, again, as a trader for sale in the\\nmarket, and not as a shepherd. yet surely the art of the shepherd is\\nconcerned only with the good of his subjects; he has only to provide\\nthe best for them, since the perfection of the art is already ensured\\nwhenever all the requirements of it are satisfied. and that was what i\\nwas saying just now about the ruler. i conceived that the art of the\\nruler, considered as ruler, whether in a state or in private life,\\ncould only regard the good of his flock or subjects; whereas you seem\\nto think that the rulers in states, that is to say, the true rulers,\\nlike being in authority.\\n\\nthink! nay, i am sure of it.\\n\\nthen why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly\\nwithout payment, unless under the idea that they govern for the\\nadvantage not of themselves but of others? let me ask you a question:\\nare not the several arts different, by reason of their each having a\\nseparate function? and, my dear illustrious friend, do say what you\\nthink, that we may make a little progress.\\n\\nyes, that is the difference, he replied.\\n\\nand each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general\\none—medicine, for example, gives us health; navigation, safety at sea,\\nand so on?\\n\\nyes, he said.\\n\\nand the art of payment has the special function of giving pay: but we\\ndo not confuse this with other arts, any more than the art of the pilot\\nis to be confused with the art of medicine, because the health of the\\npilot may be improved by a sea voyage. you would not be inclined to\\nsay, would you, that navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we\\nare to adopt your exact use of language?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nor because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not\\nsay that the art of payment is medicine?\\n\\ni should not.\\n\\nnor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a\\nman takes fees when he is engaged in healing?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nand we have admitted, i said, that the good of each art is specially\\nconfined to the art?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthen, if there be any good which all artists have in common, that is to\\nbe attributed to something of which they all have the common use?\\n\\ntrue, he replied.\\n\\nand when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is\\ngained by an additional use of the art of pay, which is not the art\\nprofessed by him?\\n\\nhe gave a reluctant assent to this.\\n\\nthen the pay is not derived by the several artists from their\\nrespective arts. but the truth is, that while the art of medicine gives\\nhealth, and the art of the builder builds a house, another art attends\\nthem which is the art of pay. the various arts may be doing their own\\nbusiness and benefiting that over which they preside, but would the\\nartist receive any benefit from his art unless he were paid as well?\\n\\ni suppose not.\\n\\nbut does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing?\\n\\ncertainly, he confers a benefit.\\n\\nthen now, thrasymachus, there is no longer any doubt that neither arts\\nnor governments provide for their own interests; but, as we were before\\nsaying, they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who\\nare the weaker and not the stronger—to their good they attend and not\\nto the good of the superior. and this is the reason, my dear\\nthrasymachus, why, as i was just now saying, no one is willing to\\ngovern; because no one likes to take in hand the reformation of evils\\nwhich are not his concern without remuneration. for, in the execution\\nof his work, and in giving his orders to another, the true artist does\\nnot regard his own interest, but always that of his subjects; and\\ntherefore in order that rulers may be willing to rule, they must be\\npaid in one of three modes of payment, money, or honour, or a penalty\\nfor refusing.\\n\\nwhat do you mean, socrates? said glaucon. the first two modes of\\npayment are intelligible enough, but what the penalty is i do not\\nunderstand, or how a penalty can be a payment.\\n\\nyou mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment which to\\nthe best men is the great inducement to rule? of course you know that\\nambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand for this reason, i said, money and honour have no attraction for\\nthem; good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing\\nand so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves\\nout of the public revenues to get the name of thieves. and not being\\nambitious they do not care about honour. wherefore necessity must be\\nlaid upon them, and they must be induced to serve from the fear of\\npunishment. and this, as i imagine, is the reason why the forwardness\\nto take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed\\ndishonourable. now the worst part of the punishment is that he who\\nrefuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself.\\nand the fear of this, as i conceive, induces the good to take office,\\nnot because they would, but because they cannot help—not under the idea\\nthat they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves, but as\\na necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling\\nto any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good. for there\\nis reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men,\\nthen to avoid office would be as much an object of contention as to\\nobtain office is at present; then we should have plain proof that the\\ntrue ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest, but that\\nof his subjects; and every one who knew this would choose rather to\\nreceive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring\\none. so far am i from agreeing with thrasymachus that justice is the\\ninterest of the stronger. this latter question need not be further\\ndiscussed at present; but when thrasymachus says that the life of the\\nunjust is more advantageous than that of the just, his new statement\\nappears to me to be of a far more serious character. which of us has\\nspoken truly? and which sort of life, glaucon, do you prefer?\\n\\ni for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous, he\\nanswered.\\n\\ndid you hear all the advantages of the unjust which thrasymachus was\\nrehearsing?\\n\\nyes, i heard him, he replied, but he has not convinced me.\\n\\nthen shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if we can, that\\nhe is saying what is not true?\\n\\nmost certainly, he replied.\\n\\nif, i said, he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all\\nthe advantages of being just, and he answers and we rejoin, there must\\nbe a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed on either\\nside, and in the end we shall want judges to decide; but if we proceed\\nin our enquiry as we lately did, by making admissions to one another,\\nwe shall unite the offices of judge and advocate in our own persons.\\n\\nvery good, he said.\\n\\nand which method do i understand you to prefer? i said.\\n\\nthat which you propose.\\n\\nwell, then, thrasymachus, i said, suppose you begin at the beginning\\nand answer me. you say that perfect injustice is more gainful than\\nperfect justice?\\n\\nyes, that is what i say, and i have given you my reasons.\\n\\nand what is your view about them? would you call one of them virtue and\\nthe other vice?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\ni suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice?\\n\\nwhat a charming notion! so likely too, seeing that i affirm injustice\\nto be profitable and justice not.\\n\\nwhat else then would you say?\\n\\nthe opposite, he replied.\\n\\nand would you call justice vice?\\n\\nno, i would rather say sublime simplicity.\\n\\nthen would you call injustice malignity?\\n\\nno; i would rather say discretion.\\n\\nand do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good?\\n\\nyes, he said; at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly\\nunjust, and who have the power of subduing states and nations; but\\nperhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses. even this profession\\nif undetected has advantages, though they are not to be compared with\\nthose of which i was just now speaking.\\n\\ni do not think that i misapprehend your meaning, thrasymachus, i\\nreplied; but still i cannot hear without amazement that you class\\ninjustice with wisdom and virtue, and justice with the opposite.\\n\\ncertainly i do so class them.\\n\\nnow, i said, you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable\\nground; for if the injustice which you were maintaining to be\\nprofitable had been admitted by you as by others to be vice and\\ndeformity, an answer might have been given to you on received\\nprinciples; but now i perceive that you will call injustice honourable\\nand strong, and to the unjust you will attribute all the qualities\\nwhich were attributed by us before to the just, seeing that you do not\\nhesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and virtue.\\n\\nyou have guessed most infallibly, he replied.\\n\\nthen i certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the\\nargument so long as i have reason to think that you, thrasymachus, are\\nspeaking your real mind; for i do believe that you are now in earnest\\nand are not amusing yourself at our expense.\\n\\ni may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you?—to refute the\\nargument is your business.\\n\\nvery true, i said; that is what i have to do: but will you be so good\\nas answer yet one more question? does the just man try to gain any\\nadvantage over the just?\\n\\nfar otherwise; if he did he would not be the simple amusing creature\\nwhich he is.\\n\\nand would he try to go beyond just action?\\n\\nhe would not.\\n\\nand how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the\\nunjust; would that be considered by him as just or unjust?\\n\\nhe would think it just, and would try to gain the advantage; but he\\nwould not be able.\\n\\nwhether he would or would not be able, i said, is not to the point. my\\nquestion is only whether the just man, while refusing to have more than\\nanother just man, would wish and claim to have more than the unjust?\\n\\nyes, he would.\\n\\nand what of the unjust—does he claim to have more than the just man and\\nto do more than is just?\\n\\nof course, he said, for he claims to have more than all men.\\n\\nand the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the\\nunjust man or action, in order that he may have more than all?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nwe may put the matter thus, i said—the just does not desire more than\\nhis like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more than\\nboth his like and his unlike?\\n\\nnothing, he said, can be better than that statement.\\n\\nand the unjust is good and wise, and the just is neither?\\n\\ngood again, he said.\\n\\nand is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike them?\\n\\nof course, he said, he who is of a certain nature, is like those who\\nare of a certain nature; he who is not, not.\\n\\neach of them, i said, is such as his like is?\\n\\ncertainly, he replied.\\n\\nvery good, thrasymachus, i said; and now to take the case of the arts:\\nyou would admit that one man is a musician and another not a musician?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand which is wise and which is foolish?\\n\\nclearly the musician is wise, and he who is not a musician is foolish.\\n\\nand he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far as he is\\nfoolish?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when he adjusts\\nthe lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the\\ntightening and loosening the strings?\\n\\ni do not think that he would.\\n\\nbut he would claim to exceed the non-musician?\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nand what would you say of the physician? in prescribing meats and\\ndrinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the\\npractice of medicine?\\n\\nhe would not.\\n\\nbut he would wish to go beyond the non-physician?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand about knowledge and ignorance in general; see whether you think\\nthat any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice of\\nsaying or doing more than another man who has knowledge. would he not\\nrather say or do the same as his like in the same case?\\n\\nthat, i suppose, can hardly be denied.\\n\\nand what of the ignorant? would he not desire to have more than either\\nthe knowing or the ignorant?\\n\\ni dare say.\\n\\nand the knowing is wise?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand the wise is good?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthen the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like, but\\nmore than his unlike and opposite?\\n\\ni suppose so.\\n\\nwhereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nbut did we not say, thrasymachus, that the unjust goes beyond both his\\nlike and unlike? were not these your words?\\n\\nthey were.\\n\\nand you also said that the just will not go beyond his like but his\\nunlike?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthen the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like the evil\\nand ignorant?\\n\\nthat is the inference.\\n\\nand each of them is such as his like is?\\n\\nthat was admitted.\\n\\nthen the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil\\nand ignorant.\\n\\nthrasymachus made all these admissions, not fluently, as i repeat them,\\nbut with extreme reluctance; it was a hot summer’s day, and the\\nperspiration poured from him in torrents; and then i saw what i had\\nnever seen before, thrasymachus blushing. as we were now agreed that\\njustice was virtue and wisdom, and injustice vice and ignorance, i\\nproceeded to another point:\\n\\nwell, i said, thrasymachus, that matter is now settled; but were we not\\nalso saying that injustice had strength; do you remember?\\n\\nyes, i remember, he said, but do not suppose that i approve of what you\\nare saying or have no answer; if however i were to answer, you would be\\nquite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either permit me to\\nhave my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and i will answer\\n‘very good,’ as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod ‘yes’\\nand ‘no.’\\n\\ncertainly not, i said, if contrary to your real opinion.\\n\\nyes, he said, i will, to please you, since you will not let me speak.\\nwhat else would you have?\\n\\nnothing in the world, i said; and if you are so disposed i will ask and\\nyou shall answer.\\n\\nproceed.\\n\\nthen i will repeat the question which i asked before, in order that our\\nexamination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may be\\ncarried on regularly. a statement was made that injustice is stronger\\nand more powerful than justice, but now justice, having been identified\\nwith wisdom and virtue, is easily shown to be stronger than injustice,\\nif injustice is ignorance; this can no longer be questioned by any one.\\nbut i want to view the matter, thrasymachus, in a different way: you\\nwould not deny that a state may be unjust and may be unjustly\\nattempting to enslave other states, or may have already enslaved them,\\nand may be holding many of them in subjection?\\n\\ntrue, he replied; and i will add that the best and most perfectly\\nunjust state will be most likely to do so.\\n\\ni know, i said, that such was your position; but what i would further\\nconsider is, whether this power which is possessed by the superior\\nstate can exist or be exercised without justice or only with justice.\\n\\nif you are right in your view, and justice is wisdom, then only with\\njustice; but if i am right, then without justice.\\n\\ni am delighted, thrasymachus, to see you not only nodding assent and\\ndissent, but making answers which are quite excellent.\\n\\nthat is out of civility to you, he replied.\\n\\nyou are very kind, i said; and would you have the goodness also to\\ninform me, whether you think that a state, or an army, or a band of\\nrobbers and thieves, or any other gang of evil-doers could act at all\\nif they injured one another?\\n\\nno indeed, he said, they could not.\\n\\nbut if they abstained from injuring one another, then they might act\\ntogether better?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and\\nfighting, and justice imparts harmony and friendship; is not that true,\\nthrasymachus?\\n\\ni agree, he said, because i do not wish to quarrel with you.\\n\\nhow good of you, i said; but i should like to know also whether\\ninjustice, having this tendency to arouse hatred, wherever existing,\\namong slaves or among freemen, will not make them hate one another and\\nset them at variance and render them incapable of common action?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand even if injustice be found in two only, will they not quarrel and\\nfight, and become enemies to one another and to the just?\\n\\nthey will.\\n\\nand suppose injustice abiding in a single person, would your wisdom say\\nthat she loses or that she retains her natural power?\\n\\nlet us assume that she retains her power.\\n\\nyet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that\\nwherever she takes up her abode, whether in a city, in an army, in a\\nfamily, or in any other body, that body is, to begin with, rendered\\nincapable of united action by reason of sedition and distraction; and\\ndoes it not become its own enemy and at variance with all that opposes\\nit, and with the just? is not this the case?\\n\\nyes, certainly.\\n\\nand is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person; in\\nthe first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not at\\nunity with himself, and in the second place making him an enemy to\\nhimself and the just? is not that true, thrasymachus?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand o my friend, i said, surely the gods are just?\\n\\ngranted that they are.\\n\\nbut if so, the unjust will be the enemy of the gods, and the just will\\nbe their friend?\\n\\nfeast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; i will not\\noppose you, lest i should displease the company.\\n\\nwell then, proceed with your answers, and let me have the remainder of\\nmy repast. for we have already shown that the just are clearly wiser\\nand better and abler than the unjust, and that the unjust are incapable\\nof common action; nay more, that to speak as we did of men who are evil\\nacting at any time vigorously together, is not strictly true, for if\\nthey had been perfectly evil, they would have laid hands upon one\\nanother; but it is evident that there must have been some remnant of\\njustice in them, which enabled them to combine; if there had not been\\nthey would have injured one another as well as their victims; they were\\nbut half-villains in their enterprises; for had they been whole\\nvillains, and utterly unjust, they would have been utterly incapable of\\naction. that, as i believe, is the truth of the matter, and not what\\nyou said at first. but whether the just have a better and happier life\\nthan the unjust is a further question which we also proposed to\\nconsider. i think that they have, and for the reasons which i have\\ngiven; but still i should like to examine further, for no light matter\\nis at stake, nothing less than the rule of human life.\\n\\nproceed.\\n\\ni will proceed by asking a question: would you not say that a horse has\\nsome end?\\n\\ni should.\\n\\nand the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could\\nnot be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?\\n\\ni do not understand, he said.\\n\\nlet me explain: can you see, except with the eye?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nor hear, except with the ear?\\n\\nno.\\n\\nthese then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs?\\n\\nthey may.\\n\\nbut you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a chisel, and\\nin many other ways?\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nand yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the purpose?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nmay we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook?\\n\\nwe may.\\n\\nthen now i think you will have no difficulty in understanding my\\nmeaning when i asked the question whether the end of anything would be\\nthat which could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by\\nany other thing?\\n\\ni understand your meaning, he said, and assent.\\n\\nand that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence? need i\\nask again whether the eye has an end?\\n\\nit has.\\n\\nand has not the eye an excellence?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand the ear has an end and an excellence also?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand the same is true of all other things; they have each of them an end\\nand a special excellence?\\n\\nthat is so.\\n\\nwell, and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their\\nown proper excellence and have a defect instead?\\n\\nhow can they, he said, if they are blind and cannot see?\\n\\nyou mean to say, if they have lost their proper excellence, which is\\nsight; but i have not arrived at that point yet. i would rather ask the\\nquestion more generally, and only enquire whether the things which\\nfulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence, and fail\\nof fulfilling them by their own defect?\\n\\ncertainly, he replied.\\n\\ni might say the same of the ears; when deprived of their own proper\\nexcellence they cannot fulfil their end?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand the same observation will apply to all other things?\\n\\ni agree.\\n\\nwell; and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil? for\\nexample, to superintend and command and deliberate and the like. are\\nnot these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be\\nassigned to any other?\\n\\nto no other.\\n\\nand is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul?\\n\\nassuredly, he said.\\n\\nand has not the soul an excellence also?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that\\nexcellence?\\n\\nshe cannot.\\n\\nthen an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent,\\nand the good soul a good ruler?\\n\\nyes, necessarily.\\n\\nand we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and\\ninjustice the defect of the soul?\\n\\nthat has been admitted.\\n\\nthen the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust man\\nwill live ill?\\n\\nthat is what your argument proves.\\n\\nand he who lives well is blessed and happy, and he who lives ill the\\nreverse of happy?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nthen the just is happy, and the unjust miserable?\\n\\nso be it.\\n\\nbut happiness and not misery is profitable.\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nthen, my blessed thrasymachus, injustice can never be more profitable\\nthan justice.\\n\\nlet this, socrates, he said, be your entertainment at the bendidea.\\n\\nfor which i am indebted to you, i said, now that you have grown gentle\\ntowards me and have left off scolding. nevertheless, i have not been\\nwell entertained; but that was my own fault and not yours. as an\\nepicure snatches a taste of every dish which is successively brought to\\ntable, he not having allowed himself time to enjoy the one before, so\\nhave i gone from one subject to another without having discovered what\\ni sought at first, the nature of justice. i left that enquiry and\\nturned away to consider whether justice is virtue and wisdom or evil\\nand folly; and when there arose a further question about the\\ncomparative advantages of justice and injustice, i could not refrain\\nfrom passing on to that. and the result of the whole discussion has\\nbeen that i know nothing at all. for i know not what justice is, and\\ntherefore i am not likely to know whether it is or is not a virtue, nor\\ncan i say whether the just man is happy or unhappy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book ii.\\n\\n\\nwith these words i was thinking that i had made an end of the\\ndiscussion; but the end, in truth, proved to be only a beginning. for\\nglaucon, who is always the most pugnacious of men, was dissatisfied at\\nthrasymachus’ retirement; he wanted to have the battle out. so he said\\nto me: socrates, do you wish really to persuade us, or only to seem to\\nhave persuaded us, that to be just is always better than to be unjust?\\n\\ni should wish really to persuade you, i replied, if i could.\\n\\nthen you certainly have not succeeded. let me ask you now:—how would\\nyou arrange goods—are there not some which we welcome for their own\\nsakes, and independently of their consequences, as, for example,\\nharmless pleasures and enjoyments, which delight us at the time,\\nalthough nothing follows from them?\\n\\ni agree in thinking that there is such a class, i replied.\\n\\nis there not also a second class of goods, such as knowledge, sight,\\nhealth, which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their\\nresults?\\n\\ncertainly, i said.\\n\\nand would you not recognize a third class, such as gymnastic, and the\\ncare of the sick, and the physician’s art; also the various ways of\\nmoney-making—these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable; and\\nno one would choose them for their own sakes, but only for the sake of\\nsome reward or result which flows from them?\\n\\nthere is, i said, this third class also. but why do you ask?\\n\\nbecause i want to know in which of the three classes you would place\\njustice?\\n\\nin the highest class, i replied,—among those goods which he who would\\nbe happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their\\nresults.\\n\\nthen the many are of another mind; they think that justice is to be\\nreckoned in the troublesome class, among goods which are to be pursued\\nfor the sake of rewards and of reputation, but in themselves are\\ndisagreeable and rather to be avoided.\\n\\ni know, i said, that this is their manner of thinking, and that this\\nwas the thesis which thrasymachus was maintaining just now, when he\\ncensured justice and praised injustice. but i am too stupid to be\\nconvinced by him.\\n\\ni wish, he said, that you would hear me as well as him, and then i\\nshall see whether you and i agree. for thrasymachus seems to me, like a\\nsnake, to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have\\nbeen; but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet\\nbeen made clear. setting aside their rewards and results, i want to\\nknow what they are in themselves, and how they inwardly work in the\\nsoul. if you, please, then, i will revive the argument of thrasymachus.\\nand first i will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to\\nthe common view of them. secondly, i will show that all men who\\npractise justice do so against their will, of necessity, but not as a\\ngood. and thirdly, i will argue that there is reason in this view, for\\nthe life of the unjust is after all better far than the life of the\\njust—if what they say is true, socrates, since i myself am not of their\\nopinion. but still i acknowledge that i am perplexed when i hear the\\nvoices of thrasymachus and myriads of others dinning in my ears; and,\\non the other hand, i have never yet heard the superiority of justice to\\ninjustice maintained by any one in a satisfactory way. i want to hear\\njustice praised in respect of itself; then i shall be satisfied, and\\nyou are the person from whom i think that i am most likely to hear\\nthis; and therefore i will praise the unjust life to the utmost of my\\npower, and my manner of speaking will indicate the manner in which i\\ndesire to hear you too praising justice and censuring injustice. will\\nyou say whether you approve of my proposal?\\n\\nindeed i do; nor can i imagine any theme about which a man of sense\\nwould oftener wish to converse.\\n\\ni am delighted, he replied, to hear you say so, and shall begin by\\nspeaking, as i proposed, of the nature and origin of justice.\\n\\nthey say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice,\\nevil; but that the evil is greater than the good. and so when men have\\nboth done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not\\nbeing able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they\\nhad better agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise\\nlaws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed\\nby them lawful and just. this they affirm to be the origin and nature\\nof justice;—it is a mean or compromise, between the best of all, which\\nis to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is\\nto suffer injustice without the power of retaliation; and justice,\\nbeing at a middle point between the two, is tolerated not as a good,\\nbut as the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the inability of men\\nto do injustice. for no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever\\nsubmit to such an agreement if he were able to resist; he would be mad\\nif he did. such is the received account, socrates, of the nature and\\norigin of justice.\\n\\nnow that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because\\nthey have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine\\nsomething of this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust\\npower to do what they will, let us watch and see whither desire will\\nlead them; then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust\\nman to be proceeding along the same road, following their interest,\\nwhich all natures deem to be their good, and are only diverted into the\\npath of justice by the force of law. the liberty which we are supposing\\nmay be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is\\nsaid to have been possessed by gyges, the ancestor of croesus the\\nlydian. according to the tradition, gyges was a shepherd in the service\\nof the king of lydia; there was a great storm, and an earthquake made\\nan opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock.\\namazed at the sight, he descended into the opening, where, among other\\nmarvels, he beheld a hollow brazen horse, having doors, at which he\\nstooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature, as appeared to him,\\nmore than human, and having nothing on but a gold ring; this he took\\nfrom the finger of the dead and reascended. now the shepherds met\\ntogether, according to custom, that they might send their monthly\\nreport about the flocks to the king; into their assembly he came having\\nthe ring on his finger, and as he was sitting among them he chanced to\\nturn the collet of the ring inside his hand, when instantly he became\\ninvisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as\\nif he were no longer present. he was astonished at this, and again\\ntouching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared; he made\\nseveral trials of the ring, and always with the same result—when he\\nturned the collet inwards he became invisible, when outwards he\\nreappeared. whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers\\nwho were sent to the court; whereas soon as he arrived he seduced the\\nqueen, and with her help conspired against the king and slew him, and\\ntook the kingdom. suppose now that there were two such magic rings, and\\nthe just put on one of them and the unjust the other; no man can be\\nimagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in\\njustice. no man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he\\ncould safely take what he liked out of the market, or go into houses\\nand lie with any one at his pleasure, or kill or release from prison\\nwhom he would, and in all respects be like a god among men. then the\\nactions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would\\nboth come at last to the same point. and this we may truly affirm to be\\na great proof that a man is just, not willingly or because he thinks\\nthat justice is any good to him individually, but of necessity, for\\nwherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust, there he is\\nunjust. for all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more\\nprofitable to the individual than justice, and he who argues as i have\\nbeen supposing, will say that they are right. if you could imagine any\\none obtaining this power of becoming invisible, and never doing any\\nwrong or touching what was another’s, he would be thought by the\\nlookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although they would praise him\\nto one another’s faces, and keep up appearances with one another from a\\nfear that they too might suffer injustice. enough of this.\\n\\nnow, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and\\nunjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the\\nisolation to be effected? i answer: let the unjust man be entirely\\nunjust, and the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away\\nfrom either of them, and both are to be perfectly furnished for the\\nwork of their respective lives. first, let the unjust be like other\\ndistinguished masters of craft; like the skilful pilot or physician,\\nwho knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits, and\\nwho, if he fails at any point, is able to recover himself. so let the\\nunjust make his unjust attempts in the right way, and lie hidden if he\\nmeans to be great in his injustice: (he who is found out is nobody:)\\nfor the highest reach of injustice is, to be deemed just when you are\\nnot. therefore i say that in the perfectly unjust man we must assume\\nthe most perfect injustice; there is to be no deduction, but we must\\nallow him, while doing the most unjust acts, to have acquired the\\ngreatest reputation for justice. if he have taken a false step he must\\nbe able to recover himself; he must be one who can speak with effect,\\nif any of his deeds come to light, and who can force his way where\\nforce is required by his courage and strength, and command of money and\\nfriends. and at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and\\nsimplicity, wishing, as aeschylus says, to be and not to seem good.\\nthere must be no seeming, for if he seem to be just he will be honoured\\nand rewarded, and then we shall not know whether he is just for the\\nsake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards; therefore, let\\nhim be clothed in justice only, and have no other covering; and he must\\nbe imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former. let him be\\nthe best of men, and let him be thought the worst; then he will have\\nbeen put to the proof; and we shall see whether he will be affected by\\nthe fear of infamy and its consequences. and let him continue thus to\\nthe hour of death; being just and seeming to be unjust. when both have\\nreached the uttermost extreme, the one of justice and the other of\\ninjustice, let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the\\ntwo.\\n\\nheavens! my dear glaucon, i said, how energetically you polish them up\\nfor the decision, first one and then the other, as if they were two\\nstatues.\\n\\ni do my best, he said. and now that we know what they are like there is\\nno difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either of\\nthem. this i will proceed to describe; but as you may think the\\ndescription a little too coarse, i ask you to suppose, socrates, that\\nthe words which follow are not mine.—let me put them into the mouths of\\nthe eulogists of injustice: they will tell you that the just man who is\\nthought unjust will be scourged, racked, bound—will have his eyes burnt\\nout; and, at last, after suffering every kind of evil, he will be\\nimpaled: then he will understand that he ought to seem only, and not to\\nbe, just; the words of aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust\\nthan of the just. for the unjust is pursuing a reality; he does not\\nlive with a view to appearances—he wants to be really unjust and not to\\nseem only:—\\n\\n‘his mind has a soil deep and fertile, out of which spring his prudent\\ncounsels.’\\n\\nin the first place, he is thought just, and therefore bears rule in the\\ncity; he can marry whom he will, and give in marriage to whom he will;\\nalso he can trade and deal where he likes, and always to his own\\nadvantage, because he has no misgivings about injustice; and at every\\ncontest, whether in public or private, he gets the better of his\\nantagonists, and gains at their expense, and is rich, and out of his\\ngains he can benefit his friends, and harm his enemies; moreover, he\\ncan offer sacrifices, and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and\\nmagnificently, and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to\\nhonour in a far better style than the just, and therefore he is likely\\nto be dearer than they are to the gods. and thus, socrates, gods and\\nmen are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the\\nlife of the just.\\n\\ni was going to say something in answer to glaucon, when adeimantus, his\\nbrother, interposed: socrates, he said, you do not suppose that there\\nis nothing more to be urged?\\n\\nwhy, what else is there? i answered.\\n\\nthe strongest point of all has not been even mentioned, he replied.\\n\\nwell, then, according to the proverb, ‘let brother help brother’—if he\\nfails in any part do you assist him; although i must confess that\\nglaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust, and take\\nfrom me the power of helping justice.\\n\\nnonsense, he replied. but let me add something more: there is another\\nside to glaucon’s argument about the praise and censure of justice and\\ninjustice, which is equally required in order to bring out what i\\nbelieve to be his meaning. parents and tutors are always telling their\\nsons and their wards that they are to be just; but why? not for the\\nsake of justice, but for the sake of character and reputation; in the\\nhope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices,\\nmarriages, and the like which glaucon has enumerated among the\\nadvantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice. more,\\nhowever, is made of appearances by this class of persons than by the\\nothers; for they throw in the good opinion of the gods, and will tell\\nyou of a shower of benefits which the heavens, as they say, rain upon\\nthe pious; and this accords with the testimony of the noble hesiod and\\nhomer, the first of whom says, that the gods make the oaks of the just—\\n\\n ‘to bear acorns at their summit, and bees in the middle;\\nand the sheep are bowed down with the weight of their fleeces,’\\n\\n\\nand many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them. and\\nhomer has a very similar strain; for he speaks of one whose fame is—\\n\\n‘as the fame of some blameless king who, like a god, maintains justice;\\nto whom the black earth brings forth wheat and barley, whose trees are\\nbowed with fruit, and his sheep never fail to bear, and the sea gives\\nhim fish.’\\n\\nstill grander are the gifts of heaven which musaeus and his son\\nvouchsafe to the just; they take them down into the world below, where\\nthey have the saints lying on couches at a feast, everlastingly drunk,\\ncrowned with garlands; their idea seems to be that an immortality of\\ndrunkenness is the highest meed of virtue. some extend their rewards\\nyet further; the posterity, as they say, of the faithful and just shall\\nsurvive to the third and fourth generation. this is the style in which\\nthey praise justice. but about the wicked there is another strain; they\\nbury them in a slough in hades, and make them carry water in a sieve;\\nalso while they are yet living they bring them to infamy, and inflict\\nupon them the punishments which glaucon described as the portion of the\\njust who are reputed to be unjust; nothing else does their invention\\nsupply. such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the\\nother.\\n\\nonce more, socrates, i will ask you to consider another way of speaking\\nabout justice and injustice, which is not confined to the poets, but is\\nfound in prose writers. the universal voice of mankind is always\\ndeclaring that justice and virtue are honourable, but grievous and\\ntoilsome; and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of\\nattainment, and are only censured by law and opinion. they say also\\nthat honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty; and\\nthey are quite ready to call wicked men happy, and to honour them both\\nin public and private when they are rich or in any other way\\ninfluential, while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and\\npoor, even though acknowledging them to be better than the others. but\\nmost extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and\\nthe gods: they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many\\ngood men, and good and happiness to the wicked. and mendicant prophets\\ngo to rich men’s doors and persuade them that they have a power\\ncommitted to them by the gods of making an atonement for a man’s own or\\nhis ancestor’s sins by sacrifices or charms, with rejoicings and\\nfeasts; and they promise to harm an enemy, whether just or unjust, at a\\nsmall cost; with magic arts and incantations binding heaven, as they\\nsay, to execute their will. and the poets are the authorities to whom\\nthey appeal, now smoothing the path of vice with the words of hesiod;—\\n\\n‘vice may be had in abundance without trouble; the way is smooth and\\nher dwelling-place is near. but before virtue the gods have set toil,’\\n\\nand a tedious and uphill road: then citing homer as a witness that the\\ngods may be influenced by men; for he also says:—\\n\\n‘the gods, too, may be turned from their purpose; and men pray to them\\nand avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties, and by\\nlibations and the odour of fat, when they have sinned and\\ntransgressed.’\\n\\nand they produce a host of books written by musaeus and orpheus, who\\nwere children of the moon and the muses—that is what they say—according\\nto which they perform their ritual, and persuade not only individuals,\\nbut whole cities, that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by\\nsacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour, and are equally at\\nthe service of the living and the dead; the latter sort they call\\nmysteries, and they redeem us from the pains of hell, but if we neglect\\nthem no one knows what awaits us.\\n\\nhe proceeded: and now when the young hear all this said about virtue\\nand vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their\\nminds likely to be affected, my dear socrates,—those of them, i mean,\\nwho are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower,\\nand from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what\\nmanner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if\\nthey would make the best of life? probably the youth will say to\\nhimself in the words of pindar—\\n\\n‘can i by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower\\nwhich may be a fortress to me all my days?’\\n\\nfor what men say is that, if i am really just and am not also thought\\njust profit there is none, but the pain and loss on the other hand are\\nunmistakeable. but if, though unjust, i acquire the reputation of\\njustice, a heavenly life is promised to me. since then, as philosophers\\nprove, appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness, to\\nappearance i must devote myself. i will describe around me a picture\\nand shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my house;\\nbehind i will trail the subtle and crafty fox, as archilochus, greatest\\nof sages, recommends. but i hear some one exclaiming that the\\nconcealment of wickedness is often difficult; to which i answer,\\nnothing great is easy. nevertheless, the argument indicates this, if we\\nwould be happy, to be the path along which we should proceed. with a\\nview to concealment we will establish secret brotherhoods and political\\nclubs. and there are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of\\npersuading courts and assemblies; and so, partly by persuasion and\\npartly by force, i shall make unlawful gains and not be punished. still\\ni hear a voice saying that the gods cannot be deceived, neither can\\nthey be compelled. but what if there are no gods? or, suppose them to\\nhave no care of human things—why in either case should we mind about\\nconcealment? and even if there are gods, and they do care about us, yet\\nwe know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the poets;\\nand these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced and\\nturned by ‘sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings.’ let us\\nbe consistent then, and believe both or neither. if the poets speak\\ntruly, why then we had better be unjust, and offer of the fruits of\\ninjustice; for if we are just, although we may escape the vengeance of\\nheaven, we shall lose the gains of injustice; but, if we are unjust, we\\nshall keep the gains, and by our sinning and praying, and praying and\\nsinning, the gods will be propitiated, and we shall not be punished.\\n‘but there is a world below in which either we or our posterity will\\nsuffer for our unjust deeds.’ yes, my friend, will be the reflection,\\nbut there are mysteries and atoning deities, and these have great\\npower. that is what mighty cities declare; and the children of the\\ngods, who were their poets and prophets, bear a like testimony.\\n\\non what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than\\nthe worst injustice? when, if we only unite the latter with a deceitful\\nregard to appearances, we shall fare to our mind both with gods and\\nmen, in life and after death, as the most numerous and the highest\\nauthorities tell us. knowing all this, socrates, how can a man who has\\nany superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth, be willing to\\nhonour justice; or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears\\njustice praised? and even if there should be some one who is able to\\ndisprove the truth of my words, and who is satisfied that justice is\\nbest, still he is not angry with the unjust, but is very ready to\\nforgive them, because he also knows that men are not just of their own\\nfree will; unless, peradventure, there be some one whom the divinity\\nwithin him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice, or who has\\nattained knowledge of the truth—but no other man. he only blames\\ninjustice who, owing to cowardice or age or some weakness, has not the\\npower of being unjust. and this is proved by the fact that when he\\nobtains the power, he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be.\\n\\nthe cause of all this, socrates, was indicated by us at the beginning\\nof the argument, when my brother and i told you how astonished we were\\nto find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice—beginning\\nwith the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us,\\nand ending with the men of our own time—no one has ever blamed\\ninjustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories,\\nhonours, and benefits which flow from them. no one has ever adequately\\ndescribed either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either\\nof them abiding in the soul, and invisible to any human or divine eye;\\nor shown that of all the things of a man’s soul which he has within\\nhim, justice is the greatest good, and injustice the greatest evil. had\\nthis been the universal strain, had you sought to persuade us of this\\nfrom our youth upwards, we should not have been on the watch to keep\\none another from doing wrong, but every one would have been his own\\nwatchman, because afraid, if he did wrong, of harbouring in himself the\\ngreatest of evils. i dare say that thrasymachus and others would\\nseriously hold the language which i have been merely repeating, and\\nwords even stronger than these about justice and injustice, grossly, as\\ni conceive, perverting their true nature. but i speak in this vehement\\nmanner, as i must frankly confess to you, because i want to hear from\\nyou the opposite side; and i would ask you to show not only the\\nsuperiority which justice has over injustice, but what effect they have\\non the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other\\nan evil to him. and please, as glaucon requested of you, to exclude\\nreputations; for unless you take away from each of them his true\\nreputation and add on the false, we shall say that you do not praise\\njustice, but the appearance of it; we shall think that you are only\\nexhorting us to keep injustice dark, and that you really agree with\\nthrasymachus in thinking that justice is another’s good and the\\ninterest of the stronger, and that injustice is a man’s own profit and\\ninterest, though injurious to the weaker. now as you have admitted that\\njustice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed\\nfor their results, but in a far greater degree for their own sakes—like\\nsight or hearing or knowledge or health, or any other real and natural\\nand not merely conventional good—i would ask you in your praise of\\njustice to regard one point only: i mean the essential good and evil\\nwhich justice and injustice work in the possessors of them. let others\\npraise justice and censure injustice, magnifying the rewards and\\nhonours of the one and abusing the other; that is a manner of arguing\\nwhich, coming from them, i am ready to tolerate, but from you who have\\nspent your whole life in the consideration of this question, unless i\\nhear the contrary from your own lips, i expect something better. and\\ntherefore, i say, not only prove to us that justice is better than\\ninjustice, but show what they either of them do to the possessor of\\nthem, which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil, whether\\nseen or unseen by gods and men.\\n\\ni had always admired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus, but on\\nhearing these words i was quite delighted, and said: sons of an\\nillustrious father, that was not a bad beginning of the elegiac verses\\nwhich the admirer of glaucon made in honour of you after you had\\ndistinguished yourselves at the battle of megara:—\\n\\n‘sons of ariston,’ he sang, ‘divine offspring of an illustrious hero.’\\n\\nthe epithet is very appropriate, for there is something truly divine in\\nbeing able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice,\\nand remaining unconvinced by your own arguments. and i do believe that\\nyou are not convinced—this i infer from your general character, for had\\ni judged only from your speeches i should have mistrusted you. but now,\\nthe greater my confidence in you, the greater is my difficulty in\\nknowing what to say. for i am in a strait between two; on the one hand\\ni feel that i am unequal to the task; and my inability is brought home\\nto me by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which i\\nmade to thrasymachus, proving, as i thought, the superiority which\\njustice has over injustice. and yet i cannot refuse to help, while\\nbreath and speech remain to me; i am afraid that there would be an\\nimpiety in being present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting\\nup a hand in her defence. and therefore i had best give such help as i\\ncan.\\n\\nglaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question\\ndrop, but to proceed in the investigation. they wanted to arrive at the\\ntruth, first, about the nature of justice and injustice, and secondly,\\nabout their relative advantages. i told them, what i really thought,\\nthat the enquiry would be of a serious nature, and would require very\\ngood eyes. seeing then, i said, that we are no great wits, i think that\\nwe had better adopt a method which i may illustrate thus; suppose that\\na short-sighted person had been asked by some one to read small letters\\nfrom a distance; and it occurred to some one else that they might be\\nfound in another place which was larger and in which the letters were\\nlarger—if they were the same and he could read the larger letters\\nfirst, and then proceed to the lesser—this would have been thought a\\nrare piece of good fortune.\\n\\nvery true, said adeimantus; but how does the illustration apply to our\\nenquiry?\\n\\ni will tell you, i replied; justice, which is the subject of our\\nenquiry, is, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an\\nindividual, and sometimes as the virtue of a state.\\n\\ntrue, he replied.\\n\\nand is not a state larger than an individual?\\n\\nit is.\\n\\nthen in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and\\nmore easily discernible. i propose therefore that we enquire into the\\nnature of justice and injustice, first as they appear in the state, and\\nsecondly in the individual, proceeding from the greater to the lesser\\nand comparing them.\\n\\nthat, he said, is an excellent proposal.\\n\\nand if we imagine the state in process of creation, we shall see the\\njustice and injustice of the state in process of creation also.\\n\\ni dare say.\\n\\nwhen the state is completed there may be a hope that the object of our\\nsearch will be more easily discovered.\\n\\nyes, far more easily.\\n\\nbut ought we to attempt to construct one? i said; for to do so, as i am\\ninclined to think, will be a very serious task. reflect therefore.\\n\\ni have reflected, said adeimantus, and am anxious that you should\\nproceed.\\n\\na state, i said, arises, as i conceive, out of the needs of mankind; no\\none is self-sufficing, but all of us have many wants. can any other\\norigin of a state be imagined?\\n\\nthere can be no other.\\n\\nthen, as we have many wants, and many persons are needed to supply\\nthem, one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another; and\\nwhen these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation\\nthe body of inhabitants is termed a state.\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nand they exchange with one another, and one gives, and another\\nreceives, under the idea that the exchange will be for their good.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nthen, i said, let us begin and create in idea a state; and yet the true\\ncreator is necessity, who is the mother of our invention.\\n\\nof course, he replied.\\n\\nnow the first and greatest of necessities is food, which is the\\ncondition of life and existence.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nthe second is a dwelling, and the third clothing and the like.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great\\ndemand: we may suppose that one man is a husbandman, another a builder,\\nsome one else a weaver—shall we add to them a shoemaker, or perhaps\\nsome other purveyor to our bodily wants?\\n\\nquite right.\\n\\nthe barest notion of a state must include four or five men.\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nand how will they proceed? will each bring the result of his labours\\ninto a common stock?—the individual husbandman, for example, producing\\nfor four, and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in\\nthe provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself;\\nor will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of\\nproducing for them, but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food\\nin a fourth of the time, and in the remaining three fourths of his time\\nbe employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes, having no\\npartnership with others, but supplying himself all his own wants?\\n\\nadeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at\\nproducing everything.\\n\\nprobably, i replied, that would be the better way; and when i hear you\\nsay this, i am myself reminded that we are not all alike; there are\\ndiversities of natures among us which are adapted to different\\noccupations.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand will you have a work better done when the workman has many\\noccupations, or when he has only one?\\n\\nwhen he has only one.\\n\\nfurther, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at\\nthe right time?\\n\\nno doubt.\\n\\nfor business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is\\nat leisure; but the doer must follow up what he is doing, and make the\\nbusiness his first object.\\n\\nhe must.\\n\\nand if so, we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully\\nand easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is\\nnatural to him and does it at the right time, and leaves other things.\\n\\nundoubtedly.\\n\\nthen more than four citizens will be required; for the husbandman will\\nnot make his own plough or mattock, or other implements of agriculture,\\nif they are to be good for anything. neither will the builder make his\\ntools—and he too needs many; and in like manner the weaver and\\nshoemaker.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthen carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be sharers\\nin our little state, which is already beginning to grow?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nyet even if we add neatherds, shepherds, and other herdsmen, in order\\nthat our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with, and builders as well\\nas husbandmen may have draught cattle, and curriers and weavers fleeces\\nand hides,—still our state will not be very large.\\n\\nthat is true; yet neither will it be a very small state which contains\\nall these.\\n\\nthen, again, there is the situation of the city—to find a place where\\nnothing need be imported is wellnigh impossible.\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nthen there must be another class of citizens who will bring the\\nrequired supply from another city?\\n\\nthere must.\\n\\nbut if the trader goes empty-handed, having nothing which they require\\nwho would supply his need, he will come back empty-handed.\\n\\nthat is certain.\\n\\nand therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for\\nthemselves, but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate\\nthose from whom their wants are supplied.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nthen more husbandmen and more artisans will be required?\\n\\nthey will.\\n\\nnot to mention the importers and exporters, who are called merchants?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthen we shall want merchants?\\n\\nwe shall.\\n\\nand if merchandise is to be carried over the sea, skilful sailors will\\nalso be needed, and in considerable numbers?\\n\\nyes, in considerable numbers.\\n\\nthen, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?\\nto secure such an exchange was, as you will remember, one of our\\nprincipal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a\\nstate.\\n\\nclearly they will buy and sell.\\n\\nthen they will need a market-place, and a money-token for purposes of\\nexchange.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nsuppose now that a husbandman, or an artisan, brings some production to\\nmarket, and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with\\nhim,—is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the market-place?\\n\\nnot at all; he will find people there who, seeing the want, undertake\\nthe office of salesmen. in well-ordered states they are commonly those\\nwho are the weakest in bodily strength, and therefore of little use for\\nany other purpose; their duty is to be in the market, and to give money\\nin exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money\\nfrom those who desire to buy.\\n\\nthis want, then, creates a class of retail-traders in our state. is not\\n‘retailer’ the term which is applied to those who sit in the\\nmarket-place engaged in buying and selling, while those who wander from\\none city to another are called merchants?\\n\\nyes, he said.\\n\\nand there is another class of servants, who are intellectually hardly\\non the level of companionship; still they have plenty of bodily\\nstrength for labour, which accordingly they sell, and are called, if i\\ndo not mistake, hirelings, hire being the name which is given to the\\nprice of their labour.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthen hirelings will help to make up our population?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand now, adeimantus, is our state matured and perfected?\\n\\ni think so.\\n\\nwhere, then, is justice, and where is injustice, and in what part of\\nthe state did they spring up?\\n\\nprobably in the dealings of these citizens with one another. i cannot\\nimagine that they are more likely to be found any where else.\\n\\ni dare say that you are right in your suggestion, i said; we had better\\nthink the matter out, and not shrink from the enquiry.\\n\\nlet us then consider, first of all, what will be their way of life, now\\nthat we have thus established them. will they not produce corn, and\\nwine, and clothes, and shoes, and build houses for themselves? and when\\nthey are housed, they will work, in summer, commonly, stripped and\\nbarefoot, but in winter substantially clothed and shod. they will feed\\non barley-meal and flour of wheat, baking and kneading them, making\\nnoble cakes and loaves; these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or\\non clean leaves, themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with\\nyew or myrtle. and they and their children will feast, drinking of the\\nwine which they have made, wearing garlands on their heads, and hymning\\nthe praises of the gods, in happy converse with one another. and they\\nwill take care that their families do not exceed their means; having an\\neye to poverty or war.\\n\\nbut, said glaucon, interposing, you have not given them a relish to\\ntheir meal.\\n\\ntrue, i replied, i had forgotten; of course they must have a\\nrelish—salt, and olives, and cheese, and they will boil roots and herbs\\nsuch as country people prepare; for a dessert we shall give them figs,\\nand peas, and beans; and they will roast myrtle-berries and acorns at\\nthe fire, drinking in moderation. and with such a diet they may be\\nexpected to live in peace and health to a good old age, and bequeath a\\nsimilar life to their children after them.\\n\\nyes, socrates, he said, and if you were providing for a city of pigs,\\nhow else would you feed the beasts?\\n\\nbut what would you have, glaucon? i replied.\\n\\nwhy, he said, you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life.\\npeople who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas, and\\ndine off tables, and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern\\nstyle.\\n\\nyes, i said, now i understand: the question which you would have me\\nconsider is, not only how a state, but how a luxurious state is\\ncreated; and possibly there is no harm in this, for in such a state we\\nshall be more likely to see how justice and injustice originate. in my\\nopinion the true and healthy constitution of the state is the one which\\ni have described. but if you wish also to see a state at fever-heat, i\\nhave no objection. for i suspect that many will not be satisfied with\\nthe simpler way of life. they will be for adding sofas, and tables, and\\nother furniture; also dainties, and perfumes, and incense, and\\ncourtesans, and cakes, all these not of one sort only, but in every\\nvariety; we must go beyond the necessaries of which i was at first\\nspeaking, such as houses, and clothes, and shoes: the arts of the\\npainter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion, and gold and\\nivory and all sorts of materials must be procured.\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nthen we must enlarge our borders; for the original healthy state is no\\nlonger sufficient. now will the city have to fill and swell with a\\nmultitude of callings which are not required by any natural want; such\\nas the whole tribe of hunters and actors, of whom one large class have\\nto do with forms and colours; another will be the votaries of\\nmusic—poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists, players, dancers,\\ncontractors; also makers of divers kinds of articles, including women’s\\ndresses. and we shall want more servants. will not tutors be also in\\nrequest, and nurses wet and dry, tirewomen and barbers, as well as\\nconfectioners and cooks; and swineherds, too, who were not needed and\\ntherefore had no place in the former edition of our state, but are\\nneeded now? they must not be forgotten: and there will be animals of\\nmany other kinds, if people eat them.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians\\nthan before?\\n\\nmuch greater.\\n\\nand the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants\\nwill be too small now, and not enough?\\n\\nquite true.\\n\\nthen a slice of our neighbours’ land will be wanted by us for pasture\\nand tillage, and they will want a slice of ours, if, like ourselves,\\nthey exceed the limit of necessity, and give themselves up to the\\nunlimited accumulation of wealth?\\n\\nthat, socrates, will be inevitable.\\n\\nand so we shall go to war, glaucon. shall we not?\\n\\nmost certainly, he replied.\\n\\nthen without determining as yet whether war does good or harm, thus\\nmuch we may affirm, that now we have discovered war to be derived from\\ncauses which are also the causes of almost all the evils in states,\\nprivate as well as public.\\n\\nundoubtedly.\\n\\nand our state must once more enlarge; and this time the enlargement\\nwill be nothing short of a whole army, which will have to go out and\\nfight with the invaders for all that we have, as well as for the things\\nand persons whom we were describing above.\\n\\nwhy? he said; are they not capable of defending themselves?\\n\\nno, i said; not if we were right in the principle which was\\nacknowledged by all of us when we were framing the state: the\\nprinciple, as you will remember, was that one man cannot practise many\\narts with success.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nbut is not war an art?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking?\\n\\nquite true.\\n\\nand the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be a husbandman, or a\\nweaver, or a builder—in order that we might have our shoes well made;\\nbut to him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he\\nwas by nature fitted, and at that he was to continue working all his\\nlife long and at no other; he was not to let opportunities slip, and\\nthen he would become a good workman. now nothing can be more important\\nthan that the work of a soldier should be well done. but is war an art\\nso easily acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a\\nhusbandman, or shoemaker, or other artisan; although no one in the\\nworld would be a good dice or draught player who merely took up the\\ngame as a recreation, and had not from his earliest years devoted\\nhimself to this and nothing else? no tools will make a man a skilled\\nworkman, or master of defence, nor be of any use to him who has not\\nlearned how to handle them, and has never bestowed any attention upon\\nthem. how then will he who takes up a shield or other implement of war\\nbecome a good fighter all in a day, whether with heavy-armed or any\\nother kind of troops?\\n\\nyes, he said, the tools which would teach men their own use would be\\nbeyond price.\\n\\nand the higher the duties of the guardian, i said, the more time, and\\nskill, and art, and application will be needed by him?\\n\\nno doubt, he replied.\\n\\nwill he not also require natural aptitude for his calling?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nthen it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted\\nfor the task of guarding the city?\\n\\nit will.\\n\\nand the selection will be no easy matter, i said; but we must be brave\\nand do our best.\\n\\nwe must.\\n\\nis not the noble youth very like a well-bred dog in respect of guarding\\nand watching?\\n\\nwhat do you mean?\\n\\ni mean that both of them ought to be quick to see, and swift to\\novertake the enemy when they see him; and strong too if, when they have\\ncaught him, they have to fight with him.\\n\\nall these qualities, he replied, will certainly be required by them.\\n\\nwell, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or dog or\\nany other animal? have you never observed how invincible and\\nunconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of\\nany creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable?\\n\\ni have.\\n\\nthen now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are\\nrequired in the guardian.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand also of the mental ones; his soul is to be full of spirit?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nbut are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another,\\nand with everybody else?\\n\\na difficulty by no means easy to overcome, he replied.\\n\\nwhereas, i said, they ought to be dangerous to their enemies, and\\ngentle to their friends; if not, they will destroy themselves without\\nwaiting for their enemies to destroy them.\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nwhat is to be done then? i said; how shall we find a gentle nature\\nwhich has also a great spirit, for the one is the contradiction of the\\nother?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nhe will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two\\nqualities; and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible;\\nand hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible.\\n\\ni am afraid that what you say is true, he replied.\\n\\nhere feeling perplexed i began to think over what had preceded.—my\\nfriend, i said, no wonder that we are in a perplexity; for we have lost\\nsight of the image which we had before us.\\n\\nwhat do you mean? he said.\\n\\ni mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite\\nqualities.\\n\\nand where do you find them?\\n\\nmany animals, i replied, furnish examples of them; our friend the dog\\nis a very good one: you know that well-bred dogs are perfectly gentle\\nto their familiars and acquaintances, and the reverse to strangers.\\n\\nyes, i know.\\n\\nthen there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our\\nfinding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nwould not he who is fitted to be a guardian, besides the spirited\\nnature, need to have the qualities of a philosopher?\\n\\ni do not apprehend your meaning.\\n\\nthe trait of which i am speaking, i replied, may be also seen in the\\ndog, and is remarkable in the animal.\\n\\nwhat trait?\\n\\nwhy, a dog, whenever he sees a stranger, is angry; when an\\nacquaintance, he welcomes him, although the one has never done him any\\nharm, nor the other any good. did this never strike you as curious?\\n\\nthe matter never struck me before; but i quite recognise the truth of\\nyour remark.\\n\\nand surely this instinct of the dog is very charming;—your dog is a\\ntrue philosopher.\\n\\nwhy?\\n\\nwhy, because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only\\nby the criterion of knowing and not knowing. and must not an animal be\\na lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the\\ntest of knowledge and ignorance?\\n\\nmost assuredly.\\n\\nand is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is\\nphilosophy?\\n\\nthey are the same, he replied.\\n\\nand may we not say confidently of man also, that he who is likely to be\\ngentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover of\\nwisdom and knowledge?\\n\\nthat we may safely affirm.\\n\\nthen he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the state will\\nrequire to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and\\nstrength?\\n\\nundoubtedly.\\n\\nthen we have found the desired natures; and now that we have found\\nthem, how are they to be reared and educated? is not this an enquiry\\nwhich may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is\\nour final end—how do justice and injustice grow up in states? for we do\\nnot want either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the\\nargument to an inconvenient length.\\n\\nadeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us.\\n\\nthen, i said, my dear friend, the task must not be given up, even if\\nsomewhat long.\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\ncome then, and let us pass a leisure hour in story-telling, and our\\nstory shall be the education of our heroes.\\n\\nby all means.\\n\\nand what shall be their education? can we find a better than the\\ntraditional sort?—and this has two divisions, gymnastic for the body,\\nand music for the soul.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nshall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic afterwards?\\n\\nby all means.\\n\\nand when you speak of music, do you include literature or not?\\n\\ni do.\\n\\nand literature may be either true or false?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand the young should be trained in both kinds, and we begin with the\\nfalse?\\n\\ni do not understand your meaning, he said.\\n\\nyou know, i said, that we begin by telling children stories which,\\nthough not wholly destitute of truth, are in the main fictitious; and\\nthese stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn\\ngymnastics.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nthat was my meaning when i said that we must teach music before\\ngymnastics.\\n\\nquite right, he said.\\n\\nyou know also that the beginning is the most important part of any\\nwork, especially in the case of a young and tender thing; for that is\\nthe time at which the character is being formed and the desired\\nimpression is more readily taken.\\n\\nquite true.\\n\\nand shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales\\nwhich may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds\\nideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish\\nthem to have when they are grown up?\\n\\nwe cannot.\\n\\nthen the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers\\nof fiction, and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is\\ngood, and reject the bad; and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell\\ntheir children the authorised ones only. let them fashion the mind with\\nsuch tales, even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands;\\nbut most of those which are now in use must be discarded.\\n\\nof what tales are you speaking? he said.\\n\\nyou may find a model of the lesser in the greater, i said; for they are\\nnecessarily of the same type, and there is the same spirit in both of\\nthem.\\n\\nvery likely, he replied; but i do not as yet know what you would term\\nthe greater.\\n\\nthose, i said, which are narrated by homer and hesiod, and the rest of\\nthe poets, who have ever been the great story-tellers of mankind.\\n\\nbut which stories do you mean, he said; and what fault do you find with\\nthem?\\n\\na fault which is most serious, i said; the fault of telling a lie, and,\\nwhat is more, a bad lie.\\n\\nbut when is this fault committed?\\n\\nwhenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and\\nheroes,—as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a\\nlikeness to the original.\\n\\nyes, he said, that sort of thing is certainly very blameable; but what\\nare the stories which you mean?\\n\\nfirst of all, i said, there was that greatest of all lies in high\\nplaces, which the poet told about uranus, and which was a bad lie\\ntoo,—i mean what hesiod says that uranus did, and how cronus retaliated\\non him. the doings of cronus, and the sufferings which in turn his son\\ninflicted upon him, even if they were true, ought certainly not to be\\nlightly told to young and thoughtless persons; if possible, they had\\nbetter be buried in silence. but if there is an absolute necessity for\\ntheir mention, a chosen few might hear them in a mystery, and they\\nshould sacrifice not a common (eleusinian) pig, but some huge and\\nunprocurable victim; and then the number of the hearers will be very\\nfew indeed.\\n\\nwhy, yes, said he, those stories are extremely objectionable.\\n\\nyes, adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our state; the\\nyoung man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he\\nis far from doing anything outrageous; and that even if he chastises\\nhis father when he does wrong, in whatever manner, he will only be\\nfollowing the example of the first and greatest among the gods.\\n\\ni entirely agree with you, he said; in my opinion those stories are\\nquite unfit to be repeated.\\n\\nneither, if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of\\nquarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest, should any\\nword be said to them of the wars in heaven, and of the plots and\\nfightings of the gods against one another, for they are not true. no,\\nwe shall never mention the battles of the giants, or let them be\\nembroidered on garments; and we shall be silent about the innumerable\\nother quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and relatives. if\\nthey would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling is\\nunholy, and that never up to this time has there been any quarrel\\nbetween citizens; this is what old men and old women should begin by\\ntelling children; and when they grow up, the poets also should be told\\nto compose for them in a similar spirit. but the narrative of\\nhephaestus binding here his mother, or how on another occasion zeus\\nsent him flying for taking her part when she was being beaten, and all\\nthe battles of the gods in homer—these tales must not be admitted into\\nour state, whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or\\nnot. for a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is\\nliteral; anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely\\nto become indelible and unalterable; and therefore it is most important\\nthat the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous\\nthoughts.\\n\\nthere you are right, he replied; but if any one asks where are such\\nmodels to be found and of what tales are you speaking—how shall we\\nanswer him?\\n\\ni said to him, you and i, adeimantus, at this moment are not poets, but\\nfounders of a state: now the founders of a state ought to know the\\ngeneral forms in which poets should cast their tales, and the limits\\nwhich must be observed by them, but to make the tales is not their\\nbusiness.\\n\\nvery true, he said; but what are these forms of theology which you\\nmean?\\n\\nsomething of this kind, i replied:—god is always to be represented as\\nhe truly is, whatever be the sort of poetry, epic, lyric or tragic, in\\nwhich the representation is given.\\n\\nright.\\n\\nand is he not truly good? and must he not be represented as such?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand no good thing is hurtful?\\n\\nno, indeed.\\n\\nand that which is not hurtful hurts not?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nand that which hurts not does no evil?\\n\\nno.\\n\\nand can that which does no evil be a cause of evil?\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nand the good is advantageous?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand therefore the cause of well-being?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nit follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things, but\\nof the good only?\\n\\nassuredly.\\n\\nthen god, if he be good, is not the author of all things, as the many\\nassert, but he is the cause of a few things only, and not of most\\nthings that occur to men. for few are the goods of human life, and many\\nare the evils, and the good is to be attributed to god alone; of the\\nevils the causes are to be sought elsewhere, and not in him.\\n\\nthat appears to me to be most true, he said.\\n\\nthen we must not listen to homer or to any other poet who is guilty of\\nthe folly of saying that two casks\\n\\n‘lie at the threshold of zeus, full of lots, one of good, the other of\\nevil lots,’\\n\\nand that he to whom zeus gives a mixture of the two\\n\\n‘sometimes meets with evil fortune, at other times with good;’\\n\\nbut that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill,\\n\\n‘him wild hunger drives o’er the beauteous earth.’\\n\\nand again—\\n\\n‘zeus, who is the dispenser of good and evil to us.’\\n\\nand if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties, which\\nwas really the work of pandarus, was brought about by athene and zeus,\\nor that the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by themis\\nand zeus, he shall not have our approval; neither will we allow our\\nyoung men to hear the words of aeschylus, that\\n\\n‘god plants guilt among men when he desires utterly to destroy a\\nhouse.’\\n\\nand if a poet writes of the sufferings of niobe—the subject of the\\ntragedy in which these iambic verses occur—or of the house of pelops,\\nor of the trojan war or on any similar theme, either we must not permit\\nhim to say that these are the works of god, or if they are of god, he\\nmust devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking; he must\\nsay that god did what was just and right, and they were the better for\\nbeing punished; but that those who are punished are miserable, and that\\ngod is the author of their misery—the poet is not to be permitted to\\nsay; though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they\\nrequire to be punished, and are benefited by receiving punishment from\\ngod; but that god being good is the author of evil to any one is to be\\nstrenuously denied, and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or\\nprose by any one whether old or young in any well-ordered commonwealth.\\nsuch a fiction is suicidal, ruinous, impious.\\n\\ni agree with you, he replied, and am ready to give my assent to the\\nlaw.\\n\\nlet this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods,\\nto which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform,—that god\\nis not the author of all things, but of good only.\\n\\nthat will do, he said.\\n\\nand what do you think of a second principle? shall i ask you whether\\ngod is a magician, and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one\\nshape, and now in another—sometimes himself changing and passing into\\nmany forms, sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such\\ntransformations; or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own\\nproper image?\\n\\ni cannot answer you, he said, without more thought.\\n\\nwell, i said; but if we suppose a change in anything, that change must\\nbe effected either by the thing itself, or by some other thing?\\n\\nmost certainly.\\n\\nand things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered\\nor discomposed; for example, when healthiest and strongest, the human\\nframe is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks, and the plant\\nwhich is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the\\nheat of the sun or any similar causes.\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nand will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged\\nby any external influence?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand the same principle, as i should suppose, applies to all composite\\nthings—furniture, houses, garments: when good and well made, they are\\nleast altered by time and circumstances.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nthen everything which is good, whether made by art or nature, or both,\\nis least liable to suffer change from without?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nbut surely god and the things of god are in every way perfect?\\n\\nof course they are.\\n\\nthen he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many\\nshapes?\\n\\nhe cannot.\\n\\nbut may he not change and transform himself?\\n\\nclearly, he said, that must be the case if he is changed at all.\\n\\nand will he then change himself for the better and fairer, or for the\\nworse and more unsightly?\\n\\nif he change at all he can only change for the worse, for we cannot\\nsuppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty.\\n\\nvery true, adeimantus; but then, would any one, whether god or man,\\ndesire to make himself worse?\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nthen it is impossible that god should ever be willing to change; being,\\nas is supposed, the fairest and best that is conceivable, every god\\nremains absolutely and for ever in his own form.\\n\\nthat necessarily follows, he said, in my judgment.\\n\\nthen, i said, my dear friend, let none of the poets tell us that\\n\\n‘the gods, taking the disguise of strangers from other lands, walk up\\nand down cities in all sorts of forms;’\\n\\nand let no one slander proteus and thetis, neither let any one, either\\nin tragedy or in any other kind of poetry, introduce here disguised in\\nthe likeness of a priestess asking an alms\\n\\n‘for the life-giving daughters of inachus the river of argos;’\\n\\n—let us have no more lies of that sort. neither must we have mothers\\nunder the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad\\nversion of these myths—telling how certain gods, as they say, ‘go about\\nby night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms;’ but\\nlet them take heed lest they make cowards of their children, and at the\\nsame time speak blasphemy against the gods.\\n\\nheaven forbid, he said.\\n\\nbut although the gods are themselves unchangeable, still by witchcraft\\nand deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms?\\n\\nperhaps, he replied.\\n\\nwell, but can you imagine that god will be willing to lie, whether in\\nword or deed, or to put forth a phantom of himself?\\n\\ni cannot say, he replied.\\n\\ndo you not know, i said, that the true lie, if such an expression may\\nbe allowed, is hated of gods and men?\\n\\nwhat do you mean? he said.\\n\\ni mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest\\nand highest part of himself, or about the truest and highest matters;\\nthere, above all, he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him.\\n\\nstill, he said, i do not comprehend you.\\n\\nthe reason is, i replied, that you attribute some profound meaning to\\nmy words; but i am only saying that deception, or being deceived or\\nuninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of\\nthemselves, which is the soul, and in that part of them to have and to\\nhold the lie, is what mankind least like;—that, i say, is what they\\nutterly detest.\\n\\nthere is nothing more hateful to them.\\n\\nand, as i was just now remarking, this ignorance in the soul of him who\\nis deceived may be called the true lie; for the lie in words is only a\\nkind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the\\nsoul, not pure unadulterated falsehood. am i not right?\\n\\nperfectly right.\\n\\nthe true lie is hated not only by the gods, but also by men?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nwhereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful; in\\ndealing with enemies—that would be an instance; or again, when those\\nwhom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to\\ndo some harm, then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or\\npreventive; also in the tales of mythology, of which we were just now\\nspeaking—because we do not know the truth about ancient times, we make\\nfalsehood as much like truth as we can, and so turn it to account.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nbut can any of these reasons apply to god? can we suppose that he is\\nignorant of antiquity, and therefore has recourse to invention?\\n\\nthat would be ridiculous, he said.\\n\\nthen the lying poet has no place in our idea of god?\\n\\ni should say not.\\n\\nor perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies?\\n\\nthat is inconceivable.\\n\\nbut he may have friends who are senseless or mad?\\n\\nbut no mad or senseless person can be a friend of god.\\n\\nthen no motive can be imagined why god should lie?\\n\\nnone whatever.\\n\\nthen the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthen is god perfectly simple and true both in word and deed; he changes\\nnot; he deceives not, either by sign or word, by dream or waking\\nvision.\\n\\nyour thoughts, he said, are the reflection of my own.\\n\\nyou agree with me then, i said, that this is the second type or form in\\nwhich we should write and speak about divine things. the gods are not\\nmagicians who transform themselves, neither do they deceive mankind in\\nany way.\\n\\ni grant that.\\n\\nthen, although we are admirers of homer, we do not admire the lying\\ndream which zeus sends to agamemnon; neither will we praise the verses\\nof aeschylus in which thetis says that apollo at her nuptials\\n\\n‘was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to be long,\\nand to know no sickness. and when he had spoken of my lot as in all\\nthings blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my\\nsoul. and i thought that the word of phoebus, being divine and full of\\nprophecy, would not fail. and now he himself who uttered the strain, he\\nwho was present at the banquet, and who said this—he it is who has\\nslain my son.’\\n\\nthese are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our\\nanger; and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus; neither shall\\nwe allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young,\\nmeaning, as we do, that our guardians, as far as men can be, should be\\ntrue worshippers of the gods and like them.\\n\\ni entirely agree, he said, in these principles, and promise to make\\nthem my laws.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book iii.\\n\\n\\nsuch then, i said, are our principles of theology—some tales are to be\\ntold, and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth\\nupwards, if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents, and to\\nvalue friendship with one another.\\n\\nyes; and i think that our principles are right, he said.\\n\\nbut if they are to be courageous, must they not learn other lessons\\nbesides these, and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of\\ndeath? can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him?\\n\\ncertainly not, he said.\\n\\nand can he be fearless of death, or will he choose death in battle\\nrather than defeat and slavery, who believes the world below to be real\\nand terrible?\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nthen we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales\\nas well as over the others, and beg them not simply to revile but\\nrather to commend the world below, intimating to them that their\\ndescriptions are untrue, and will do harm to our future warriors.\\n\\nthat will be our duty, he said.\\n\\nthen, i said, we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages,\\nbeginning with the verses,\\n\\n‘i would rather be a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man\\nthan rule over all the dead who have come to nought.’\\n\\nwe must also expunge the verse, which tells us how pluto feared,\\n\\n‘lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should be seen\\nboth of mortals and immortals.’\\n\\nand again:—\\n\\n‘o heavens! verily in the house of hades there is soul and ghostly form\\nbut no mind at all!’\\n\\nagain of tiresias:—\\n\\n‘(to him even after death did persephone grant mind,) that he alone\\nshould be wise; but the other souls are flitting shades.’\\n\\nagain:—\\n\\n‘the soul flying from the limbs had gone to hades, lamenting her fate,\\nleaving manhood and youth.’\\n\\nagain:—\\n\\n‘and the soul, with shrilling cry, passed like smoke beneath the\\nearth.’\\n\\nand,—\\n\\n‘as bats in hollow of mystic cavern, whenever any of them has dropped\\nout of the string and falls from the rock, fly shrilling and cling to\\none another, so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they\\nmoved.’\\n\\nand we must beg homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike\\nout these and similar passages, not because they are unpoetical, or\\nunattractive to the popular ear, but because the greater the poetical\\ncharm of them, the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who\\nare meant to be free, and who should fear slavery more than death.\\n\\nundoubtedly.\\n\\nalso we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names which\\ndescribe the world below—cocytus and styx, ghosts under the earth, and\\nsapless shades, and any similar words of which the very mention causes\\na shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them. i do\\nnot say that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind;\\nbut there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered\\ntoo excitable and effeminate by them.\\n\\nthere is a real danger, he said.\\n\\nthen we must have no more of them.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nanother and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us.\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nand shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous\\nmen?\\n\\nthey will go with the rest.\\n\\nbut shall we be right in getting rid of them? reflect: our principle is\\nthat the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good\\nman who is his comrade.\\n\\nyes; that is our principle.\\n\\nand therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he\\nhad suffered anything terrible?\\n\\nhe will not.\\n\\nsuch an one, as we further maintain, is sufficient for himself and his\\nown happiness, and therefore is least in need of other men.\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nand for this reason the loss of a son or brother, or the deprivation of\\nfortune, is to him of all men least terrible.\\n\\nassuredly.\\n\\nand therefore he will be least likely to lament, and will bear with the\\ngreatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him.\\n\\nyes, he will feel such a misfortune far less than another.\\n\\nthen we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous\\nmen, and making them over to women (and not even to women who are good\\nfor anything), or to men of a baser sort, that those who are being\\neducated by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the\\nlike.\\n\\nthat will be very right.\\n\\nthen we will once more entreat homer and the other poets not to depict\\nachilles, who is the son of a goddess, first lying on his side, then on\\nhis back, and then on his face; then starting up and sailing in a\\nfrenzy along the shores of the barren sea; now taking the sooty ashes\\nin both his hands and pouring them over his head, or weeping and\\nwailing in the various modes which homer has delineated. nor should he\\ndescribe priam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching,\\n\\n‘rolling in the dirt, calling each man loudly by his name.’\\n\\nstill more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce\\nthe gods lamenting and saying,\\n\\n‘alas! my misery! alas! that i bore the bravest to my sorrow.’\\n\\nbut if he must introduce the gods, at any rate let him not dare so\\ncompletely to misrepresent the greatest of the gods, as to make him\\nsay—\\n\\n‘o heavens! with my eyes verily i behold a dear friend of mine chased\\nround and round the city, and my heart is sorrowful.’\\n\\nor again:—\\n\\nwoe is me that i am fated to have sarpedon, dearest of men to me,\\nsubdued at the hands of patroclus the son of menoetius.’\\n\\nfor if, my sweet adeimantus, our youth seriously listen to such\\nunworthy representations of the gods, instead of laughing at them as\\nthey ought, hardly will any of them deem that he himself, being but a\\nman, can be dishonoured by similar actions; neither will he rebuke any\\ninclination which may arise in his mind to say and do the like. and\\ninstead of having any shame or self-control, he will be always whining\\nand lamenting on slight occasions.\\n\\nyes, he said, that is most true.\\n\\nyes, i replied; but that surely is what ought not to be, as the\\nargument has just proved to us; and by that proof we must abide until\\nit is disproved by a better.\\n\\nit ought not to be.\\n\\nneither ought our guardians to be given to laughter. for a fit of\\nlaughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a\\nviolent reaction.\\n\\nso i believe.\\n\\nthen persons of worth, even if only mortal men, must not be represented\\nas overcome by laughter, and still less must such a representation of\\nthe gods be allowed.\\n\\nstill less of the gods, as you say, he replied.\\n\\nthen we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods\\nas that of homer when he describes how\\n\\n‘inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods, when they saw\\nhephaestus bustling about the mansion.’\\n\\non your views, we must not admit them.\\n\\non my views, if you like to father them on me; that we must not admit\\nthem is certain.\\n\\nagain, truth should be highly valued; if, as we were saying, a lie is\\nuseless to the gods, and useful only as a medicine to men, then the use\\nof such medicines should be restricted to physicians; private\\nindividuals have no business with them.\\n\\nclearly not, he said.\\n\\nthen if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying, the rulers of\\nthe state should be the persons; and they, in their dealings either\\nwith enemies or with their own citizens, may be allowed to lie for the\\npublic good. but nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind;\\nand although the rulers have this privilege, for a private man to lie\\nto them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the\\npatient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his\\nown bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer, or for a\\nsailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the ship and the\\nrest of the crew, and how things are going with himself or his fellow\\nsailors.\\n\\nmost true, he said.\\n\\nif, then, the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the state,\\n\\n‘any of the craftsmen, whether he be priest or physician or carpenter,’\\n\\nhe will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally\\nsubversive and destructive of ship or state.\\n\\nmost certainly, he said, if our idea of the state is ever carried out.\\n\\nin the next place our youth must be temperate?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nare not the chief elements of temperance, speaking generally, obedience\\nto commanders and self-control in sensual pleasures?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthen we shall approve such language as that of diomede in homer,\\n\\n‘friend, sit still and obey my word,’\\n\\nand the verses which follow,\\n\\n‘the greeks marched breathing prowess, ...in silent awe of their\\nleaders,’\\n\\nand other sentiments of the same kind.\\n\\nwe shall.\\n\\nwhat of this line,\\n\\n‘o heavy with wine, who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a\\nstag,’\\n\\nand of the words which follow? would you say that these, or any similar\\nimpertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to\\ntheir rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?\\n\\nthey are ill spoken.\\n\\nthey may very possibly afford some amusement, but they do not conduce\\nto temperance. and therefore they are likely to do harm to our young\\nmen—you would agree with me there?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand then, again, to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his\\nopinion is more glorious than\\n\\n‘when the tables are full of bread and meat, and the cup-bearer carries\\nround wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups,’\\n\\nis it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such\\nwords? or the verse\\n\\n‘the saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger?’\\n\\nwhat would you say again to the tale of zeus, who, while other gods and\\nmen were asleep and he the only person awake, lay devising plans, but\\nforgot them all in a moment through his lust, and was so completely\\novercome at the sight of here that he would not even go into the hut,\\nbut wanted to lie with her on the ground, declaring that he had never\\nbeen in such a state of rapture before, even when they first met one\\nanother\\n\\n‘without the knowledge of their parents;’\\n\\nor that other tale of how hephaestus, because of similar goings on,\\ncast a chain around ares and aphrodite?\\n\\nindeed, he said, i am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear\\nthat sort of thing.\\n\\nbut any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men, these\\nthey ought to see and hear; as, for example, what is said in the\\nverses,\\n\\n‘he smote his breast, and thus reproached his heart, endure, my heart;\\nfar worse hast thou endured!’\\n\\ncertainly, he said.\\n\\nin the next place, we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers\\nof money.\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nneither must we sing to them of\\n\\n‘gifts persuading gods, and persuading reverend kings.’\\n\\nneither is phoenix, the tutor of achilles, to be approved or deemed to\\nhave given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take\\nthe gifts of the greeks and assist them; but that without a gift he\\nshould not lay aside his anger. neither will we believe or acknowledge\\nachilles himself to have been such a lover of money that he took\\nagamemnon’s gifts, or that when he had received payment he restored the\\ndead body of hector, but that without payment he was unwilling to do\\nso.\\n\\nundoubtedly, he said, these are not sentiments which can be approved.\\n\\nloving homer as i do, i hardly like to say that in attributing these\\nfeelings to achilles, or in believing that they are truly attributed to\\nhim, he is guilty of downright impiety. as little can i believe the\\nnarrative of his insolence to apollo, where he says,\\n\\n‘thou hast wronged me, o far-darter, most abominable of deities. verily\\ni would be even with thee, if i had only the power;’\\n\\nor his insubordination to the river-god, on whose divinity he is ready\\nto lay hands; or his offering to the dead patroclus of his own hair,\\nwhich had been previously dedicated to the other river-god spercheius,\\nand that he actually performed this vow; or that he dragged hector\\nround the tomb of patroclus, and slaughtered the captives at the pyre;\\nof all this i cannot believe that he was guilty, any more than i can\\nallow our citizens to believe that he, the wise cheiron’s pupil, the\\nson of a goddess and of peleus who was the gentlest of men and third in\\ndescent from zeus, was so disordered in his wits as to be at one time\\nthe slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions, meanness, not\\nuntainted by avarice, combined with overweening contempt of gods and\\nmen.\\n\\nyou are quite right, he replied.\\n\\nand let us equally refuse to believe, or allow to be repeated, the tale\\nof theseus son of poseidon, or of peirithous son of zeus, going forth\\nas they did to perpetrate a horrid rape; or of any other hero or son of\\na god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely\\nascribe to them in our day: and let us further compel the poets to\\ndeclare either that these acts were not done by them, or that they were\\nnot the sons of gods;—both in the same breath they shall not be\\npermitted to affirm. we will not have them trying to persuade our youth\\nthat the gods are the authors of evil, and that heroes are no better\\nthan men—sentiments which, as we were saying, are neither pious nor\\ntrue, for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the gods.\\n\\nassuredly not.\\n\\nand further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear\\nthem; for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is\\nconvinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by—\\n\\n‘the kindred of the gods, the relatives of zeus, whose ancestral altar,\\nthe altar of zeus, is aloft in air on the peak of ida,’\\n\\nand who have\\n\\n‘the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins.’\\n\\nand therefore let us put an end to such tales, lest they engender\\nlaxity of morals among the young.\\n\\nby all means, he replied.\\n\\nbut now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not\\nto be spoken of, let us see whether any have been omitted by us. the\\nmanner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should\\nbe treated has been already laid down.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand what shall we say about men? that is clearly the remaining portion\\nof our subject.\\n\\nclearly so.\\n\\nbut we are not in a condition to answer this question at present, my\\nfriend.\\n\\nwhy not?\\n\\nbecause, if i am not mistaken, we shall have to say that about men\\npoets and story-tellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements\\nwhen they tell us that wicked men are often happy, and the good\\nmiserable; and that injustice is profitable when undetected, but that\\njustice is a man’s own loss and another’s gain—these things we shall\\nforbid them to utter, and command them to sing and say the opposite.\\n\\nto be sure we shall, he replied.\\n\\nbut if you admit that i am right in this, then i shall maintain that\\nyou have implied the principle for which we have been all along\\ncontending.\\n\\ni grant the truth of your inference.\\n\\nthat such things are or are not to be said about men is a question\\nwhich we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is, and\\nhow naturally advantageous to the possessor, whether he seem to be just\\nor not.\\n\\nmost true, he said.\\n\\nenough of the subjects of poetry: let us now speak of the style; and\\nwhen this has been considered, both matter and manner will have been\\ncompletely treated.\\n\\ni do not understand what you mean, said adeimantus.\\n\\nthen i must make you understand; and perhaps i may be more intelligible\\nif i put the matter in this way. you are aware, i suppose, that all\\nmythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or\\nto come?\\n\\ncertainly, he replied.\\n\\nand narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union\\nof the two?\\n\\nthat again, he said, i do not quite understand.\\n\\ni fear that i must be a ridiculous teacher when i have so much\\ndifficulty in making myself apprehended. like a bad speaker, therefore,\\ni will not take the whole of the subject, but will break a piece off in\\nillustration of my meaning. you know the first lines of the iliad, in\\nwhich the poet says that chryses prayed agamemnon to release his\\ndaughter, and that agamemnon flew into a passion with him; whereupon\\nchryses, failing of his object, invoked the anger of the god against\\nthe achaeans. now as far as these lines,\\n\\n‘and he prayed all the greeks, but especially the two sons of atreus,\\nthe chiefs of the people,’\\n\\nthe poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose\\nthat he is any one else. but in what follows he takes the person of\\nchryses, and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the\\nspeaker is not homer, but the aged priest himself. and in this double\\nform he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at\\ntroy and in ithaca and throughout the odyssey.\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites\\nfrom time to time and in the intermediate passages?\\n\\nquite true.\\n\\nbut when the poet speaks in the person of another, may we not say that\\nhe assimilates his style to that of the person who, as he informs you,\\nis going to speak?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice\\nor gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes?\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nthen in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by\\nway of imitation?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nor, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then\\nagain the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple\\nnarration. however, in order that i may make my meaning quite clear,\\nand that you may no more say, ‘i don’t understand,’ i will show how the\\nchange might be effected. if homer had said, ‘the priest came, having\\nhis daughter’s ransom in his hands, supplicating the achaeans, and\\nabove all the kings;’ and then if, instead of speaking in the person of\\nchryses, he had continued in his own person, the words would have been,\\nnot imitation, but simple narration. the passage would have run as\\nfollows (i am no poet, and therefore i drop the metre), ‘the priest\\ncame and prayed the gods on behalf of the greeks that they might\\ncapture troy and return safely home, but begged that they would give\\nhim back his daughter, and take the ransom which he brought, and\\nrespect the god. thus he spoke, and the other greeks revered the priest\\nand assented. but agamemnon was wroth, and bade him depart and not come\\nagain, lest the staff and chaplets of the god should be of no avail to\\nhim—the daughter of chryses should not be released, he said—she should\\ngrow old with him in argos. and then he told him to go away and not to\\nprovoke him, if he intended to get home unscathed. and the old man went\\naway in fear and silence, and, when he had left the camp, he called\\nupon apollo by his many names, reminding him of everything which he had\\ndone pleasing to him, whether in building his temples, or in offering\\nsacrifice, and praying that his good deeds might be returned to him,\\nand that the achaeans might expiate his tears by the arrows of the\\ngod,’—and so on. in this way the whole becomes simple narrative.\\n\\ni understand, he said.\\n\\nor you may suppose the opposite case—that the intermediate passages are\\nomitted, and the dialogue only left.\\n\\nthat also, he said, i understand; you mean, for example, as in tragedy.\\n\\nyou have conceived my meaning perfectly; and if i mistake not, what you\\nfailed to apprehend before is now made clear to you, that poetry and\\nmythology are, in some cases, wholly imitative—instances of this are\\nsupplied by tragedy and comedy; there is likewise the opposite style,\\nin which the poet is the only speaker—of this the dithyramb affords the\\nbest example; and the combination of both is found in epic, and in\\nseveral other styles of poetry. do i take you with me?\\n\\nyes, he said; i see now what you meant.\\n\\ni will ask you to remember also what i began by saying, that we had\\ndone with the subject and might proceed to the style.\\n\\nyes, i remember.\\n\\nin saying this, i intended to imply that we must come to an\\nunderstanding about the mimetic art,—whether the poets, in narrating\\ntheir stories, are to be allowed by us to imitate, and if so, whether\\nin whole or in part, and if the latter, in what parts; or should all\\nimitation be prohibited?\\n\\nyou mean, i suspect, to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be\\nadmitted into our state?\\n\\nyes, i said; but there may be more than this in question: i really do\\nnot know as yet, but whither the argument may blow, thither we go.\\n\\nand go we will, he said.\\n\\nthen, adeimantus, let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be\\nimitators; or rather, has not this question been decided by the rule\\nalready laid down that one man can only do one thing well, and not\\nmany; and that if he attempt many, he will altogether fail of gaining\\nmuch reputation in any?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand this is equally true of imitation; no one man can imitate many\\nthings as well as he would imitate a single one?\\n\\nhe cannot.\\n\\nthen the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in\\nlife, and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other\\nparts as well; for even when two species of imitation are nearly\\nallied, the same persons cannot succeed in both, as, for example, the\\nwriters of tragedy and comedy—did you not just now call them\\nimitations?\\n\\nyes, i did; and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot\\nsucceed in both.\\n\\nany more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nneither are comic and tragic actors the same; yet all these things are\\nbut imitations.\\n\\nthey are so.\\n\\nand human nature, adeimantus, appears to have been coined into yet\\nsmaller pieces, and to be as incapable of imitating many things well,\\nas of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies.\\n\\nquite true, he replied.\\n\\nif then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our\\nguardians, setting aside every other business, are to dedicate\\nthemselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the state, making\\nthis their craft, and engaging in no work which does not bear on this\\nend, they ought not to practise or imitate anything else; if they\\nimitate at all, they should imitate from youth upward only those\\ncharacters which are suitable to their profession—the courageous,\\ntemperate, holy, free, and the like; but they should not depict or be\\nskilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness, lest from\\nimitation they should come to be what they imitate. did you never\\nobserve how imitations, beginning in early youth and continuing far\\ninto life, at length grow into habits and become a second nature,\\naffecting body, voice, and mind?\\n\\nyes, certainly, he said.\\n\\nthen, i said, we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of\\nwhom we say that they ought to be good men, to imitate a woman, whether\\nyoung or old, quarrelling with her husband, or striving and vaunting\\nagainst the gods in conceit of her happiness, or when she is in\\naffliction, or sorrow, or weeping; and certainly not one who is in\\nsickness, love, or labour.\\n\\nvery right, he said.\\n\\nneither must they represent slaves, male or female, performing the\\noffices of slaves?\\n\\nthey must not.\\n\\nand surely not bad men, whether cowards or any others, who do the\\nreverse of what we have just been prescribing, who scold or mock or\\nrevile one another in drink or out of drink, or who in any other manner\\nsin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed, as the\\nmanner of such is. neither should they be trained to imitate the action\\nor speech of men or women who are mad or bad; for madness, like vice,\\nis to be known but not to be practised or imitated.\\n\\nvery true, he replied.\\n\\nneither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or\\nboatswains, or the like?\\n\\nhow can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds\\nto the callings of any of these?\\n\\nnor may they imitate the neighing of horses, the bellowing of bulls,\\nthe murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean, thunder, and all that sort\\nof thing?\\n\\nnay, he said, if madness be forbidden, neither may they copy the\\nbehaviour of madmen.\\n\\nyou mean, i said, if i understand you aright, that there is one sort of\\nnarrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has\\nanything to say, and that another sort will be used by a man of an\\nopposite character and education.\\n\\nand which are these two sorts? he asked.\\n\\nsuppose, i answered, that a just and good man in the course of a\\nnarration comes on some saying or action of another good man,—i should\\nimagine that he will like to personate him, and will not be ashamed of\\nthis sort of imitation: he will be most ready to play the part of the\\ngood man when he is acting firmly and wisely; in a less degree when he\\nis overtaken by illness or love or drink, or has met with any other\\ndisaster. but when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him, he\\nwill not make a study of that; he will disdain such a person, and will\\nassume his likeness, if at all, for a moment only when he is performing\\nsome good action; at other times he will be ashamed to play a part\\nwhich he has never practised, nor will he like to fashion and frame\\nhimself after the baser models; he feels the employment of such an art,\\nunless in jest, to be beneath him, and his mind revolts at it.\\n\\nso i should expect, he replied.\\n\\nthen he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated out\\nof homer, that is to say, his style will be both imitative and\\nnarrative; but there will be very little of the former, and a great\\ndeal of the latter. do you agree?\\n\\ncertainly, he said; that is the model which such a speaker must\\nnecessarily take.\\n\\nbut there is another sort of character who will narrate anything, and,\\nthe worse he is, the more unscrupulous he will be; nothing will be too\\nbad for him: and he will be ready to imitate anything, not as a joke,\\nbut in right good earnest, and before a large company. as i was just\\nnow saying, he will attempt to represent the roll of thunder, the noise\\nof wind and hail, or the creaking of wheels, and pulleys, and the\\nvarious sounds of flutes, pipes, trumpets, and all sorts of\\ninstruments: he will bark like a dog, bleat like a sheep, or crow like\\na cock; his entire art will consist in imitation of voice and gesture,\\nand there will be very little narration.\\n\\nthat, he said, will be his mode of speaking.\\n\\nthese, then, are the two kinds of style?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and\\nhas but slight changes; and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen\\nfor their simplicity, the result is that the speaker, if he speaks\\ncorrectly, is always pretty much the same in style, and he will keep\\nwithin the limits of a single harmony (for the changes are not great),\\nand in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm?\\n\\nthat is quite true, he said.\\n\\nwhereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of\\nrhythms, if the music and the style are to correspond, because the\\nstyle has all sorts of changes.\\n\\nthat is also perfectly true, he replied.\\n\\nand do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all\\npoetry, and every form of expression in words? no one can say anything\\nexcept in one or other of them or in both together.\\n\\nthey include all, he said.\\n\\nand shall we receive into our state all the three styles, or one only\\nof the two unmixed styles? or would you include the mixed?\\n\\ni should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue.\\n\\nyes, i said, adeimantus, but the mixed style is also very charming: and\\nindeed the pantomimic, which is the opposite of the one chosen by you,\\nis the most popular style with children and their attendants, and with\\nthe world in general.\\n\\ni do not deny it.\\n\\nbut i suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our\\nstate, in which human nature is not twofold or manifold, for one man\\nplays one part only?\\n\\nyes; quite unsuitable.\\n\\nand this is the reason why in our state, and in our state only, we\\nshall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also, and a\\nhusbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also, and a soldier a\\nsoldier and not a trader also, and the same throughout?\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nand therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen, who are so\\nclever that they can imitate anything, comes to us, and makes a\\nproposal to exhibit himself and his poetry, we will fall down and\\nworship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being; but we must also\\ninform him that in our state such as he are not permitted to exist; the\\nlaw will not allow them. and so when we have anointed him with myrrh,\\nand set a garland of wool upon his head, we shall send him away to\\nanother city. for we mean to employ for our souls’ health the rougher\\nand severer poet or story-teller, who will imitate the style of the\\nvirtuous only, and will follow those models which we prescribed at\\nfirst when we began the education of our soldiers.\\n\\nwe certainly will, he said, if we have the power.\\n\\nthen now, my friend, i said, that part of music or literary education\\nwhich relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished;\\nfor the matter and manner have both been discussed.\\n\\ni think so too, he said.\\n\\nnext in order will follow melody and song.\\n\\nthat is obvious.\\n\\nevery one can see already what we ought to say about them, if we are to\\nbe consistent with ourselves.\\n\\ni fear, said glaucon, laughing, that the word ‘every one’ hardly\\nincludes me, for i cannot at the moment say what they should be; though\\ni may guess.\\n\\nat any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts—the words,\\nthe melody, and the rhythm; that degree of knowledge i may presuppose?\\n\\nyes, he said; so much as that you may.\\n\\nand as for the words, there will surely be no difference between words\\nwhich are and which are not set to music; both will conform to the same\\nlaws, and these have been already determined by us?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nwe were saying, when we spoke of the subject-matter, that we had no\\nneed of lamentation and strains of sorrow?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow? you are musical, and\\ncan tell me.\\n\\nthe harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor lydian, and the\\nfull-toned or bass lydian, and such like.\\n\\nthese then, i said, must be banished; even to women who have a\\ncharacter to maintain they are of no use, and much less to men.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nin the next place, drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly\\nunbecoming the character of our guardians.\\n\\nutterly unbecoming.\\n\\nand which are the soft or drinking harmonies?\\n\\nthe ionian, he replied, and the lydian; they are termed ‘relaxed.’\\n\\nwell, and are these of any military use?\\n\\nquite the reverse, he replied; and if so the dorian and the phrygian\\nare the only ones which you have left.\\n\\ni answered: of the harmonies i know nothing, but i want to have one\\nwarlike, to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the\\nhour of danger and stern resolve, or when his cause is failing, and he\\nis going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil, and at\\nevery such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a\\ndetermination to endure; and another to be used by him in times of\\npeace and freedom of action, when there is no pressure of necessity,\\nand he is seeking to persuade god by prayer, or man by instruction and\\nadmonition, or on the other hand, when he is expressing his willingness\\nto yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition, and which represents\\nhim when by prudent conduct he has attained his end, not carried away\\nby his success, but acting moderately and wisely under the\\ncircumstances, and acquiescing in the event. these two harmonies i ask\\nyou to leave; the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom, the\\nstrain of the unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate, the strain\\nof courage, and the strain of temperance; these, i say, leave.\\n\\nand these, he replied, are the dorian and phrygian harmonies of which i\\nwas just now speaking.\\n\\nthen, i said, if these and these only are to be used in our songs and\\nmelodies, we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic\\nscale?\\n\\ni suppose not.\\n\\nthen we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners\\nand complex scales, or the makers of any other many-stringed\\ncuriously-harmonised instruments?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nbut what do you say to flute-makers and flute-players? would you admit\\nthem into our state when you reflect that in this composite use of\\nharmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put\\ntogether; even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute?\\n\\nclearly not.\\n\\nthere remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city, and\\nthe shepherds may have a pipe in the country.\\n\\nthat is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument.\\n\\nthe preferring of apollo and his instruments to marsyas and his\\ninstruments is not at all strange, i said.\\n\\nnot at all, he replied.\\n\\nand so, by the dog of egypt, we have been unconsciously purging the\\nstate, which not long ago we termed luxurious.\\n\\nand we have done wisely, he replied.\\n\\nthen let us now finish the purgation, i said. next in order to\\nharmonies, rhythms will naturally follow, and they should be subject to\\nthe same rules, for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre,\\nor metres of every kind, but rather to discover what rhythms are the\\nexpressions of a courageous and harmonious life; and when we have found\\nthem, we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like\\nspirit, not the words to the foot and melody. to say what these rhythms\\nare will be your duty—you must teach me them, as you have already\\ntaught me the harmonies.\\n\\nbut, indeed, he replied, i cannot tell you. i only know that there are\\nsome three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are\\nframed, just as in sounds there are four notes (i.e. the four notes of\\nthe tetrachord.) out of which all the harmonies are composed; that is\\nan observation which i have made. but of what sort of lives they are\\nseverally the imitations i am unable to say.\\n\\nthen, i said, we must take damon into our counsels; and he will tell us\\nwhat rhythms are expressive of meanness, or insolence, or fury, or\\nother unworthiness, and what are to be reserved for the expression of\\nopposite feelings. and i think that i have an indistinct recollection\\nof his mentioning a complex cretic rhythm; also a dactylic or heroic,\\nand he arranged them in some manner which i do not quite understand,\\nmaking the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot, long and\\nshort alternating; and, unless i am mistaken, he spoke of an iambic as\\nwell as of a trochaic rhythm, and assigned to them short and long\\nquantities. also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the\\nmovement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm; or perhaps a\\ncombination of the two; for i am not certain what he meant. these\\nmatters, however, as i was saying, had better be referred to damon\\nhimself, for the analysis of the subject would be difficult, you know?\\n(socrates expresses himself carelessly in accordance with his assumed\\nignorance of the details of the subject. in the first part of the\\nsentence he appears to be speaking of paeonic rhythms which are in the\\nratio of 3/2; in the second part, of dactylic and anapaestic rhythms,\\nwhich are in the ratio of 1/1; in the last clause, of iambic and\\ntrochaic rhythms, which are in the ratio of 1/2 or 2/1.)\\n\\nrather so, i should say.\\n\\nbut there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace\\nis an effect of good or bad rhythm.\\n\\nnone at all.\\n\\nand also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and\\nbad style; and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style;\\nfor our principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the\\nwords, and not the words by them.\\n\\njust so, he said, they should follow the words.\\n\\nand will not the words and the character of the style depend on the\\ntemper of the soul?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand everything else on the style?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthen beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on\\nsimplicity,—i mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered\\nmind and character, not that other simplicity which is only an\\neuphemism for folly?\\n\\nvery true, he replied.\\n\\nand if our youth are to do their work in life, must they not make these\\ngraces and harmonies their perpetual aim?\\n\\nthey must.\\n\\nand surely the art of the painter and every other creative and\\nconstructive art are full of them,—weaving, embroidery, architecture,\\nand every kind of manufacture; also nature, animal and vegetable,—in\\nall of them there is grace or the absence of grace. and ugliness and\\ndiscord and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill\\nnature, as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and\\nvirtue and bear their likeness.\\n\\nthat is quite true, he said.\\n\\nbut shall our superintendence go no further, and are the poets only to\\nbe required by us to express the image of the good in their works, on\\npain, if they do anything else, of expulsion from our state? or is the\\nsame control to be extended to other artists, and are they also to be\\nprohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance\\nand meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other\\ncreative arts; and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be\\nprevented from practising his art in our state, lest the taste of our\\ncitizens be corrupted by him? we would not have our guardians grow up\\namid images of moral deformity, as in some noxious pasture, and there\\nbrowse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day, little\\nby little, until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in\\ntheir own soul. let our artists rather be those who are gifted to\\ndiscern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful; then will our\\nyouth dwell in a land of health, amid fair sights and sounds, and\\nreceive the good in everything; and beauty, the effluence of fair\\nworks, shall flow into the eye and ear, like a health-giving breeze\\nfrom a purer region, and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years\\ninto likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason.\\n\\nthere can be no nobler training than that, he replied.\\n\\nand therefore, i said, glaucon, musical training is a more potent\\ninstrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way\\ninto the inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten,\\nimparting grace, and making the soul of him who is rightly educated\\ngraceful, or of him who is ill-educated ungraceful; and also because he\\nwho has received this true education of the inner being will most\\nshrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature, and with a\\ntrue taste, while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his\\nsoul the good, and becomes noble and good, he will justly blame and\\nhate the bad, now in the days of his youth, even before he is able to\\nknow the reason why; and when reason comes he will recognise and salute\\nthe friend with whom his education has made him long familiar.\\n\\nyes, he said, i quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should\\nbe trained in music and on the grounds which you mention.\\n\\njust as in learning to read, i said, we were satisfied when we knew the\\nletters of the alphabet, which are very few, in all their recurring\\nsizes and combinations; not slighting them as unimportant whether they\\noccupy a space large or small, but everywhere eager to make them out;\\nand not thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we\\nrecognise them wherever they are found:\\n\\ntrue—\\n\\nor, as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water, or in a\\nmirror, only when we know the letters themselves; the same art and\\nstudy giving us the knowledge of both:\\n\\nexactly—\\n\\neven so, as i maintain, neither we nor our guardians, whom we have to\\neducate, can ever become musical until we and they know the essential\\nforms of temperance, courage, liberality, magnificence, and their\\nkindred, as well as the contrary forms, in all their combinations, and\\ncan recognise them and their images wherever they are found, not\\nslighting them either in small things or great, but believing them all\\nto be within the sphere of one art and study.\\n\\nmost assuredly.\\n\\nand when a beautiful soul harmonizes with a beautiful form, and the two\\nare cast in one mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him who\\nhas an eye to see it?\\n\\nthe fairest indeed.\\n\\nand the fairest is also the loveliest?\\n\\nthat may be assumed.\\n\\nand the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the\\nloveliest; but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul?\\n\\nthat is true, he replied, if the deficiency be in his soul; but if\\nthere be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it,\\nand will love all the same.\\n\\ni perceive, i said, that you have or have had experiences of this sort,\\nand i agree. but let me ask you another question: has excess of\\npleasure any affinity to temperance?\\n\\nhow can that be? he replied; pleasure deprives a man of the use of his\\nfaculties quite as much as pain.\\n\\nor any affinity to virtue in general?\\n\\nnone whatever.\\n\\nany affinity to wantonness and intemperance?\\n\\nyes, the greatest.\\n\\nand is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love?\\n\\nno, nor a madder.\\n\\nwhereas true love is a love of beauty and order—temperate and\\nharmonious?\\n\\nquite true, he said.\\n\\nthen no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true\\nlove?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nthen mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the\\nlover and his beloved; neither of them can have any part in it if their\\nlove is of the right sort?\\n\\nno, indeed, socrates, it must never come near them.\\n\\nthen i suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a\\nlaw to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his\\nlove than a father would use to his son, and then only for a noble\\npurpose, and he must first have the other’s consent; and this rule is\\nto limit him in all his intercourse, and he is never to be seen going\\nfurther, or, if he exceeds, he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and\\nbad taste.\\n\\ni quite agree, he said.\\n\\nthus much of music, which makes a fair ending; for what should be the\\nend of music if not the love of beauty?\\n\\ni agree, he said.\\n\\nafter music comes gymnastic, in which our youth are next to be trained.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\ngymnastic as well as music should begin in early years; the training in\\nit should be careful and should continue through life. now my belief\\nis,—and this is a matter upon which i should like to have your opinion\\nin confirmation of my own, but my own belief is,—not that the good body\\nby any bodily excellence improves the soul, but, on the contrary, that\\nthe good soul, by her own excellence, improves the body as far as this\\nmay be possible. what do you say?\\n\\nyes, i agree.\\n\\nthen, to the mind when adequately trained, we shall be right in handing\\nover the more particular care of the body; and in order to avoid\\nprolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject.\\n\\nvery good.\\n\\nthat they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by\\nus; for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and\\nnot know where in the world he is.\\n\\nyes, he said; that a guardian should require another guardian to take\\ncare of him is ridiculous indeed.\\n\\nbut next, what shall we say of their food; for the men are in training\\nfor the great contest of all—are they not?\\n\\nyes, he said.\\n\\nand will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them?\\n\\nwhy not?\\n\\ni am afraid, i said, that a habit of body such as they have is but a\\nsleepy sort of thing, and rather perilous to health. do you not observe\\nthat these athletes sleep away their lives, and are liable to most\\ndangerous illnesses if they depart, in ever so slight a degree, from\\ntheir customary regimen?\\n\\nyes, i do.\\n\\nthen, i said, a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior\\nathletes, who are to be like wakeful dogs, and to see and hear with the\\nutmost keenness; amid the many changes of water and also of food, of\\nsummer heat and winter cold, which they will have to endure when on a\\ncampaign, they must not be liable to break down in health.\\n\\nthat is my view.\\n\\nthe really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music\\nwhich we were just now describing.\\n\\nhow so?\\n\\nwhy, i conceive that there is a gymnastic which, like our music, is\\nsimple and good; and especially the military gymnastic.\\n\\nwhat do you mean?\\n\\nmy meaning may be learned from homer; he, you know, feeds his heroes at\\ntheir feasts, when they are campaigning, on soldiers’ fare; they have\\nno fish, although they are on the shores of the hellespont, and they\\nare not allowed boiled meats but only roast, which is the food most\\nconvenient for soldiers, requiring only that they should light a fire,\\nand not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand i can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere\\nmentioned in homer. in proscribing them, however, he is not singular;\\nall professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in\\ngood condition should take nothing of the kind.\\n\\nyes, he said; and knowing this, they are quite right in not taking\\nthem.\\n\\nthen you would not approve of syracusan dinners, and the refinements of\\nsicilian cookery?\\n\\ni think not.\\n\\nnor, if a man is to be in condition, would you allow him to have a\\ncorinthian girl as his fair friend?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nneither would you approve of the delicacies, as they are thought, of\\nathenian confectionary?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nall such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody and\\nsong composed in the panharmonic style, and in all the rhythms.\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nthere complexity engendered licence, and here disease; whereas\\nsimplicity in music was the parent of temperance in the soul; and\\nsimplicity in gymnastic of health in the body.\\n\\nmost true, he said.\\n\\nbut when intemperance and diseases multiply in a state, halls of\\njustice and medicine are always being opened; and the arts of the\\ndoctor and the lawyer give themselves airs, finding how keen is the\\ninterest which not only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about\\nthem.\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nand yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state\\nof education than this, that not only artisans and the meaner sort of\\npeople need the skill of first-rate physicians and judges, but also\\nthose who would profess to have had a liberal education? is it not\\ndisgraceful, and a great sign of want of good-breeding, that a man\\nshould have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of\\nhis own at home, and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of\\nother men whom he makes lords and judges over him?\\n\\nof all things, he said, the most disgraceful.\\n\\nwould you say ‘most,’ i replied, when you consider that there is a\\nfurther stage of the evil in which a man is not only a life-long\\nlitigant, passing all his days in the courts, either as plaintiff or\\ndefendant, but is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his\\nlitigiousness; he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty; able to\\ntake every crooked turn, and wriggle into and out of every hole,\\nbending like a withy and getting out of the way of justice: and all for\\nwhat?—in order to gain small points not worth mentioning, he not\\nknowing that so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping\\njudge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing. is not that still more\\ndisgraceful?\\n\\nyes, he said, that is still more disgraceful.\\n\\nwell, i said, and to require the help of medicine, not when a wound has\\nto be cured, or on occasion of an epidemic, but just because, by\\nindolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing, men fill\\nthemselves with waters and winds, as if their bodies were a marsh,\\ncompelling the ingenious sons of asclepius to find more names for\\ndiseases, such as flatulence and catarrh; is not this, too, a disgrace?\\n\\nyes, he said, they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names\\nto diseases.\\n\\nyes, i said, and i do not believe that there were any such diseases in\\nthe days of asclepius; and this i infer from the circumstance that the\\nhero eurypylus, after he has been wounded in homer, drinks a posset of\\npramnian wine well besprinkled with barley-meal and grated cheese,\\nwhich are certainly inflammatory, and yet the sons of asclepius who\\nwere at the trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink,\\nor rebuke patroclus, who is treating his case.\\n\\nwell, he said, that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a\\nperson in his condition.\\n\\nnot so extraordinary, i replied, if you bear in mind that in former\\ndays, as is commonly said, before the time of herodicus, the guild of\\nasclepius did not practise our present system of medicine, which may be\\nsaid to educate diseases. but herodicus, being a trainer, and himself\\nof a sickly constitution, by a combination of training and doctoring\\nfound out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself, and secondly\\nthe rest of the world.\\n\\nhow was that? he said.\\n\\nby the invention of lingering death; for he had a mortal disease which\\nhe perpetually tended, and as recovery was out of the question, he\\npassed his entire life as a valetudinarian; he could do nothing but\\nattend upon himself, and he was in constant torment whenever he\\ndeparted in anything from his usual regimen, and so dying hard, by the\\nhelp of science he struggled on to old age.\\n\\na rare reward of his skill!\\n\\nyes, i said; a reward which a man might fairly expect who never\\nunderstood that, if asclepius did not instruct his descendants in\\nvaletudinarian arts, the omission arose, not from ignorance or\\ninexperience of such a branch of medicine, but because he knew that in\\nall well-ordered states every individual has an occupation to which he\\nmust attend, and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being\\nill. this we remark in the case of the artisan, but, ludicrously\\nenough, do not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort.\\n\\nhow do you mean? he said.\\n\\ni mean this: when a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough\\nand ready cure; an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife,—these\\nare his remedies. and if some one prescribes for him a course of\\ndietetics, and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head, and\\nall that sort of thing, he replies at once that he has no time to be\\nill, and that he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his\\ndisease to the neglect of his customary employment; and therefore\\nbidding good-bye to this sort of physician, he resumes his ordinary\\nhabits, and either gets well and lives and does his business, or, if\\nhis constitution fails, he dies and has no more trouble.\\n\\nyes, he said, and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art\\nof medicine thus far only.\\n\\nhas he not, i said, an occupation; and what profit would there be in\\nhis life if he were deprived of his occupation?\\n\\nquite true, he said.\\n\\nbut with the rich man this is otherwise; of him we do not say that he\\nhas any specially appointed work which he must perform, if he would\\nlive.\\n\\nhe is generally supposed to have nothing to do.\\n\\nthen you never heard of the saying of phocylides, that as soon as a man\\nhas a livelihood he should practise virtue?\\n\\nnay, he said, i think that he had better begin somewhat sooner.\\n\\nlet us not have a dispute with him about this, i said; but rather ask\\nourselves: is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man, or can\\nhe live without it? and if obligatory on him, then let us raise a\\nfurther question, whether this dieting of disorders, which is an\\nimpediment to the application of the mind in carpentering and the\\nmechanical arts, does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of\\nphocylides?\\n\\nof that, he replied, there can be no doubt; such excessive care of the\\nbody, when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic, is most inimical to\\nthe practice of virtue.\\n\\nyes, indeed, i replied, and equally incompatible with the management of\\na house, an army, or an office of state; and, what is most important of\\nall, irreconcileable with any kind of study or thought or\\nself-reflection—there is a constant suspicion that headache and\\ngiddiness are to be ascribed to philosophy, and hence all practising or\\nmaking trial of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped; for a\\nman is always fancying that he is being made ill, and is in constant\\nanxiety about the state of his body.\\n\\nyes, likely enough.\\n\\nand therefore our politic asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited\\nthe power of his art only to persons who, being generally of healthy\\nconstitution and habits of life, had a definite ailment; such as these\\nhe cured by purges and operations, and bade them live as usual, herein\\nconsulting the interests of the state; but bodies which disease had\\npenetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure by\\ngradual processes of evacuation and infusion: he did not want to\\nlengthen out good-for-nothing lives, or to have weak fathers begetting\\nweaker sons;—if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had\\nno business to cure him; for such a cure would have been of no use\\neither to himself, or to the state.\\n\\nthen, he said, you regard asclepius as a statesman.\\n\\nclearly; and his character is further illustrated by his sons. note\\nthat they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of\\nwhich i am speaking at the siege of troy: you will remember how, when\\npandarus wounded menelaus, they\\n\\n‘sucked the blood out of the wound, and sprinkled soothing remedies,’\\n\\nbut they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or\\ndrink in the case of menelaus, any more than in the case of eurypylus;\\nthe remedies, as they conceived, were enough to heal any man who before\\nhe was wounded was healthy and regular in his habits; and even though\\nhe did happen to drink a posset of pramnian wine, he might get well all\\nthe same. but they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and\\nintemperate subjects, whose lives were of no use either to themselves\\nor others; the art of medicine was not designed for their good, and\\nthough they were as rich as midas, the sons of asclepius would have\\ndeclined to attend them.\\n\\nthey were very acute persons, those sons of asclepius.\\n\\nnaturally so, i replied. nevertheless, the tragedians and pindar\\ndisobeying our behests, although they acknowledge that asclepius was\\nthe son of apollo, say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man\\nwho was at the point of death, and for this reason he was struck by\\nlightning. but we, in accordance with the principle already affirmed by\\nus, will not believe them when they tell us both;—if he was the son of\\na god, we maintain that he was not avaricious; or, if he was\\navaricious, he was not the son of a god.\\n\\nall that, socrates, is excellent; but i should like to put a question\\nto you: ought there not to be good physicians in a state, and are not\\nthe best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions\\ngood and bad? and are not the best judges in like manner those who are\\nacquainted with all sorts of moral natures?\\n\\nyes, i said, i too would have good judges and good physicians. but do\\nyou know whom i think good?\\n\\nwill you tell me?\\n\\ni will, if i can. let me however note that in the same question you\\njoin two things which are not the same.\\n\\nhow so? he asked.\\n\\nwhy, i said, you join physicians and judges. now the most skilful\\nphysicians are those who, from their youth upwards, have combined with\\nthe knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease; they had\\nbetter not be robust in health, and should have had all manner of\\ndiseases in their own persons. for the body, as i conceive, is not the\\ninstrument with which they cure the body; in that case we could not\\nallow them ever to be or to have been sickly; but they cure the body\\nwith the mind, and the mind which has become and is sick can cure\\nnothing.\\n\\nthat is very true, he said.\\n\\nbut with the judge it is otherwise; since he governs mind by mind; he\\nought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds, and to\\nhave associated with them from youth upwards, and to have gone through\\nthe whole calendar of crime, only in order that he may quickly infer\\nthe crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own\\nself-consciousness; the honourable mind which is to form a healthy\\njudgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits\\nwhen young. and this is the reason why in youth good men often appear\\nto be simple, and are easily practised upon by the dishonest, because\\nthey have no examples of what evil is in their own souls.\\n\\nyes, he said, they are far too apt to be deceived.\\n\\ntherefore, i said, the judge should not be young; he should have\\nlearned to know evil, not from his own soul, but from late and long\\nobservation of the nature of evil in others: knowledge should be his\\nguide, not personal experience.\\n\\nyes, he said, that is the ideal of a judge.\\n\\nyes, i replied, and he will be a good man (which is my answer to your\\nquestion); for he is good who has a good soul. but the cunning and\\nsuspicious nature of which we spoke,—he who has committed many crimes,\\nand fancies himself to be a master in wickedness, when he is amongst\\nhis fellows, is wonderful in the precautions which he takes, because he\\njudges of them by himself: but when he gets into the company of men of\\nvirtue, who have the experience of age, he appears to be a fool again,\\nowing to his unseasonable suspicions; he cannot recognise an honest\\nman, because he has no pattern of honesty in himself; at the same time,\\nas the bad are more numerous than the good, and he meets with them\\noftener, he thinks himself, and is by others thought to be, rather wise\\nthan foolish.\\n\\nmost true, he said.\\n\\nthen the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man, but\\nthe other; for vice cannot know virtue too, but a virtuous nature,\\neducated by time, will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice: the\\nvirtuous, and not the vicious, man has wisdom—in my opinion.\\n\\nand in mine also.\\n\\nthis is the sort of medicine, and this is the sort of law, which you\\nwill sanction in your state. they will minister to better natures,\\ngiving health both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in\\ntheir bodies they will leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable\\nsouls they will put an end to themselves.\\n\\nthat is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the state.\\n\\nand thus our youth, having been educated only in that simple music\\nwhich, as we said, inspires temperance, will be reluctant to go to law.\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nand the musician, who, keeping to the same track, is content to\\npractise the simple gymnastic, will have nothing to do with medicine\\nunless in some extreme case.\\n\\nthat i quite believe.\\n\\nthe very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to\\nstimulate the spirited element of his nature, and not to increase his\\nstrength; he will not, like common athletes, use exercise and regimen\\nto develope his muscles.\\n\\nvery right, he said.\\n\\nneither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed, as is\\noften supposed, the one for the training of the soul, the other for the\\ntraining of the body.\\n\\nwhat then is the real object of them?\\n\\ni believe, i said, that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the\\nimprovement of the soul.\\n\\nhow can that be? he asked.\\n\\ndid you never observe, i said, the effect on the mind itself of\\nexclusive devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive\\ndevotion to music?\\n\\nin what way shown? he said.\\n\\nthe one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity, the other of\\nsoftness and effeminacy, i replied.\\n\\nyes, he said, i am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much\\nof a savage, and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond\\nwhat is good for him.\\n\\nyet surely, i said, this ferocity only comes from spirit, which, if\\nrightly educated, would give courage, but, if too much intensified, is\\nliable to become hard and brutal.\\n\\nthat i quite think.\\n\\non the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness.\\nand this also, when too much indulged, will turn to softness, but, if\\neducated rightly, will be gentle and moderate.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?\\n\\nassuredly.\\n\\nand both should be in harmony?\\n\\nbeyond question.\\n\\nand the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand, when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul\\nthrough the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs\\nof which we were just now speaking, and his whole life is passed in\\nwarbling and the delights of song; in the first stage of the process\\nthe passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron, and made\\nuseful, instead of brittle and useless. but, if he carries on the\\nsoftening and soothing process, in the next stage he begins to melt and\\nwaste, until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of\\nhis soul; and he becomes a feeble warrior.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nif the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is\\nspeedily accomplished, but if he have a good deal, then the power of\\nmusic weakening the spirit renders him excitable;—on the least\\nprovocation he flames up at once, and is speedily extinguished; instead\\nof having spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite\\nimpracticable.\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nand so in gymnastics, if a man takes violent exercise and is a great\\nfeeder, and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy, at\\nfirst the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit,\\nand he becomes twice the man that he was.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand what happens? if he do nothing else, and holds no converse with the\\nmuses, does not even that intelligence which there may be in him,\\nhaving no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or\\nculture, grow feeble and dull and blind, his mind never waking up or\\nreceiving nourishment, and his senses not being purged of their mists?\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nand he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy, uncivilized, never using\\nthe weapon of persuasion,—he is like a wild beast, all violence and\\nfierceness, and knows no other way of dealing; and he lives in all\\nignorance and evil conditions, and has no sense of propriety and grace.\\n\\nthat is quite true, he said.\\n\\nand as there are two principles of human nature, one the spirited and\\nthe other the philosophical, some god, as i should say, has given\\nmankind two arts answering to them (and only indirectly to the soul and\\nbody), in order that these two principles (like the strings of an\\ninstrument) may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly\\nharmonized.\\n\\nthat appears to be the intention.\\n\\nand he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions, and\\nbest attempers them to the soul, may be rightly called the true\\nmusician and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the\\nstrings.\\n\\nyou are quite right, socrates.\\n\\nand such a presiding genius will be always required in our state if the\\ngovernment is to last.\\n\\nyes, he will be absolutely necessary.\\n\\nsuch, then, are our principles of nurture and education: where would be\\nthe use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens,\\nor about their hunting and coursing, their gymnastic and equestrian\\ncontests? for these all follow the general principle, and having found\\nthat, we shall have no difficulty in discovering them.\\n\\ni dare say that there will be no difficulty.\\n\\nvery good, i said; then what is the next question? must we not ask who\\nare to be rulers and who subjects?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nthere can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger.\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nand that the best of these must rule.\\n\\nthat is also clear.\\n\\nnow, are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to\\nhusbandry?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand as we are to have the best of guardians for our city, must they not\\nbe those who have most the character of guardians?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand to this end they ought to be wise and efficient, and to have a\\nspecial care of the state?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves?\\n\\nto be sure.\\n\\nand he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the\\nsame interests with himself, and that of which the good or evil fortune\\nis supposed by him at any time most to affect his own?\\n\\nvery true, he replied.\\n\\nthen there must be a selection. let us note among the guardians those\\nwho in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for\\nthe good of their country, and the greatest repugnance to do what is\\nagainst her interests.\\n\\nthose are the right men.\\n\\nand they will have to be watched at every age, in order that we may see\\nwhether they preserve their resolution, and never, under the influence\\neither of force or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of duty\\nto the state.\\n\\nhow cast off? he said.\\n\\ni will explain to you, i replied. a resolution may go out of a man’s\\nmind either with his will or against his will; with his will when he\\ngets rid of a falsehood and learns better, against his will whenever he\\nis deprived of a truth.\\n\\ni understand, he said, the willing loss of a resolution; the meaning of\\nthe unwilling i have yet to learn.\\n\\nwhy, i said, do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good,\\nand willingly of evil? is not to have lost the truth an evil, and to\\npossess the truth a good? and you would agree that to conceive things\\nas they are is to possess the truth?\\n\\nyes, he replied; i agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived\\nof truth against their will.\\n\\nand is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft, or\\nforce, or enchantment?\\n\\nstill, he replied, i do not understand you.\\n\\ni fear that i must have been talking darkly, like the tragedians. i\\nonly mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others\\nforget; argument steals away the hearts of one class, and time of the\\nother; and this i call theft. now you understand me?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthose again who are forced, are those whom the violence of some pain or\\ngrief compels to change their opinion.\\n\\ni understand, he said, and you are quite right.\\n\\nand you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change\\ntheir minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the\\nsterner influence of fear?\\n\\nyes, he said; everything that deceives may be said to enchant.\\n\\ntherefore, as i was just now saying, we must enquire who are the best\\nguardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest of\\nthe state is to be the rule of their lives. we must watch them from\\ntheir youth upwards, and make them perform actions in which they are\\nmost likely to forget or to be deceived, and he who remembers and is\\nnot deceived is to be selected, and he who fails in the trial is to be\\nrejected. that will be the way?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for\\nthem, in which they will be made to give further proof of the same\\nqualities.\\n\\nvery right, he replied.\\n\\nand then, i said, we must try them with enchantments—that is the third\\nsort of test—and see what will be their behaviour: like those who take\\ncolts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature, so\\nmust we take our youth amid terrors of some kind, and again pass them\\ninto pleasures, and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in\\nthe furnace, that we may discover whether they are armed against all\\nenchantments, and of a noble bearing always, good guardians of\\nthemselves and of the music which they have learned, and retaining\\nunder all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature, such as\\nwill be most serviceable to the individual and to the state. and he who\\nat every age, as boy and youth and in mature life, has come out of the\\ntrial victorious and pure, shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of\\nthe state; he shall be honoured in life and death, and shall receive\\nsepulture and other memorials of honour, the greatest that we have to\\ngive. but him who fails, we must reject. i am inclined to think that\\nthis is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should be\\nchosen and appointed. i speak generally, and not with any pretension to\\nexactness.\\n\\nand, speaking generally, i agree with you, he said.\\n\\nand perhaps the word ‘guardian’ in the fullest sense ought to be\\napplied to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign\\nenemies and maintain peace among our citizens at home, that the one may\\nnot have the will, or the others the power, to harm us. the young men\\nwhom we before called guardians may be more properly designated\\nauxiliaries and supporters of the principles of the rulers.\\n\\ni agree with you, he said.\\n\\nhow then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we\\nlately spoke—just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers, if that\\nbe possible, and at any rate the rest of the city?\\n\\nwhat sort of lie? he said.\\n\\nnothing new, i replied; only an old phoenician tale (laws) of what has\\noften occurred before now in other places, (as the poets say, and have\\nmade the world believe,) though not in our time, and i do not know\\nwhether such an event could ever happen again, or could now even be\\nmade probable, if it did.\\n\\nhow your words seem to hesitate on your lips!\\n\\nyou will not wonder, i replied, at my hesitation when you have heard.\\n\\nspeak, he said, and fear not.\\n\\nwell then, i will speak, although i really know not how to look you in\\nthe face, or in what words to utter the audacious fiction, which i\\npropose to communicate gradually, first to the rulers, then to the\\nsoldiers, and lastly to the people. they are to be told that their\\nyouth was a dream, and the education and training which they received\\nfrom us, an appearance only; in reality during all that time they were\\nbeing formed and fed in the womb of the earth, where they themselves\\nand their arms and appurtenances were manufactured; when they were\\ncompleted, the earth, their mother, sent them up; and so, their country\\nbeing their mother and also their nurse, they are bound to advise for\\nher good, and to defend her against attacks, and her citizens they are\\nto regard as children of the earth and their own brothers.\\n\\nyou had good reason, he said, to be ashamed of the lie which you were\\ngoing to tell.\\n\\ntrue, i replied, but there is more coming; i have only told you half.\\ncitizens, we shall say to them in our tale, you are brothers, yet god\\nhas framed you differently. some of you have the power of command, and\\nin the composition of these he has mingled gold, wherefore also they\\nhave the greatest honour; others he has made of silver, to be\\nauxiliaries; others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has\\ncomposed of brass and iron; and the species will generally be preserved\\nin the children. but as all are of the same original stock, a golden\\nparent will sometimes have a silver son, or a silver parent a golden\\nson. and god proclaims as a first principle to the rulers, and above\\nall else, that there is nothing which they should so anxiously guard,\\nor of which they are to be such good guardians, as of the purity of the\\nrace. they should observe what elements mingle in their offspring; for\\nif the son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and\\niron, then nature orders a transposition of ranks, and the eye of the\\nruler must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend\\nin the scale and become a husbandman or artisan, just as there may be\\nsons of artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are\\nraised to honour, and become guardians or auxiliaries. for an oracle\\nsays that when a man of brass or iron guards the state, it will be\\ndestroyed. such is the tale; is there any possibility of making our\\ncitizens believe in it?\\n\\nnot in the present generation, he replied; there is no way of\\naccomplishing this; but their sons may be made to believe in the tale,\\nand their sons’ sons, and posterity after them.\\n\\ni see the difficulty, i replied; yet the fostering of such a belief\\nwill make them care more for the city and for one another. enough,\\nhowever, of the fiction, which may now fly abroad upon the wings of\\nrumour, while we arm our earth-born heroes, and lead them forth under\\nthe command of their rulers. let them look round and select a spot\\nwhence they can best suppress insurrection, if any prove refractory\\nwithin, and also defend themselves against enemies, who like wolves may\\ncome down on the fold from without; there let them encamp, and when\\nthey have encamped, let them sacrifice to the proper gods and prepare\\ntheir dwellings.\\n\\njust so, he said.\\n\\nand their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold\\nof winter and the heat of summer.\\n\\ni suppose that you mean houses, he replied.\\n\\nyes, i said; but they must be the houses of soldiers, and not of\\nshop-keepers.\\n\\nwhat is the difference? he said.\\n\\nthat i will endeavour to explain, i replied. to keep watch-dogs, who,\\nfrom want of discipline or hunger, or some evil habit or other, would\\nturn upon the sheep and worry them, and behave not like dogs but\\nwolves, would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd?\\n\\ntruly monstrous, he said.\\n\\nand therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries, being\\nstronger than our citizens, may not grow to be too much for them and\\nbecome savage tyrants instead of friends and allies?\\n\\nyes, great care should be taken.\\n\\nand would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard?\\n\\nbut they are well-educated already, he replied.\\n\\ni cannot be so confident, my dear glaucon, i said; i am much more\\ncertain that they ought to be, and that true education, whatever that\\nmay be, will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them\\nin their relations to one another, and to those who are under their\\nprotection.\\n\\nvery true, he replied.\\n\\nand not only their education, but their habitations, and all that\\nbelongs to them, should be such as will neither impair their virtue as\\nguardians, nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens. any man of\\nsense must acknowledge that.\\n\\nhe must.\\n\\nthen now let us consider what will be their way of life, if they are to\\nrealize our idea of them. in the first place, none of them should have\\nany property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary; neither\\nshould they have a private house or store closed against any one who\\nhas a mind to enter; their provisions should be only such as are\\nrequired by trained warriors, who are men of temperance and courage;\\nthey should agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay,\\nenough to meet the expenses of the year and no more; and they will go\\nto mess and live together like soldiers in a camp. gold and silver we\\nwill tell them that they have from god; the diviner metal is within\\nthem, and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current\\namong men, and ought not to pollute the divine by any such earthly\\nadmixture; for that commoner metal has been the source of many unholy\\ndeeds, but their own is undefiled. and they alone of all the citizens\\nmay not touch or handle silver or gold, or be under the same roof with\\nthem, or wear them, or drink from them. and this will be their\\nsalvation, and they will be the saviours of the state. but should they\\never acquire homes or lands or moneys of their own, they will become\\nhousekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians, enemies and tyrants\\ninstead of allies of the other citizens; hating and being hated,\\nplotting and being plotted against, they will pass their whole life in\\nmuch greater terror of internal than of external enemies, and the hour\\nof ruin, both to themselves and to the rest of the state, will be at\\nhand. for all which reasons may we not say that thus shall our state be\\nordered, and that these shall be the regulations appointed by us for\\nguardians concerning their houses and all other matters?\\n\\nyes, said glaucon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book iv.\\n\\n\\nhere adeimantus interposed a question: how would you answer, socrates,\\nsaid he, if a person were to say that you are making these people\\nmiserable, and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness; the\\ncity in fact belongs to them, but they are none the better for it;\\nwhereas other men acquire lands, and build large and handsome houses,\\nand have everything handsome about them, offering sacrifices to the\\ngods on their own account, and practising hospitality; moreover, as you\\nwere saying just now, they have gold and silver, and all that is usual\\namong the favourites of fortune; but our poor citizens are no better\\nthan mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting\\nguard?\\n\\nyes, i said; and you may add that they are only fed, and not paid in\\naddition to their food, like other men; and therefore they cannot, if\\nthey would, take a journey of pleasure; they have no money to spend on\\na mistress or any other luxurious fancy, which, as the world goes, is\\nthought to be happiness; and many other accusations of the same nature\\nmight be added.\\n\\nbut, said he, let us suppose all this to be included in the charge.\\n\\nyou mean to ask, i said, what will be our answer?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nif we proceed along the old path, my belief, i said, is that we shall\\nfind the answer. and our answer will be that, even as they are, our\\nguardians may very likely be the happiest of men; but that our aim in\\nfounding the state was not the disproportionate happiness of any one\\nclass, but the greatest happiness of the whole; we thought that in a\\nstate which is ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should\\nbe most likely to find justice, and in the ill-ordered state injustice:\\nand, having found them, we might then decide which of the two is the\\nhappier. at present, i take it, we are fashioning the happy state, not\\npiecemeal, or with a view of making a few happy citizens, but as a\\nwhole; and by-and-by we will proceed to view the opposite kind of\\nstate. suppose that we were painting a statue, and some one came up to\\nus and said, why do you not put the most beautiful colours on the most\\nbeautiful parts of the body—the eyes ought to be purple, but you have\\nmade them black—to him we might fairly answer, sir, you would not\\nsurely have us beautify the eyes to such a degree that they are no\\nlonger eyes; consider rather whether, by giving this and the other\\nfeatures their due proportion, we make the whole beautiful. and so i\\nsay to you, do not compel us to assign to the guardians a sort of\\nhappiness which will make them anything but guardians; for we too can\\nclothe our husbandmen in royal apparel, and set crowns of gold on their\\nheads, and bid them till the ground as much as they like, and no more.\\nour potters also might be allowed to repose on couches, and feast by\\nthe fireside, passing round the winecup, while their wheel is\\nconveniently at hand, and working at pottery only as much as they like;\\nin this way we might make every class happy—and then, as you imagine,\\nthe whole state would be happy. but do not put this idea into our\\nheads; for, if we listen to you, the husbandman will be no longer a\\nhusbandman, the potter will cease to be a potter, and no one will have\\nthe character of any distinct class in the state. now this is not of\\nmuch consequence where the corruption of society, and pretension to be\\nwhat you are not, is confined to cobblers; but when the guardians of\\nthe laws and of the government are only seeming and not real guardians,\\nthen see how they turn the state upside down; and on the other hand\\nthey alone have the power of giving order and happiness to the state.\\nwe mean our guardians to be true saviours and not the destroyers of the\\nstate, whereas our opponent is thinking of peasants at a festival, who\\nare enjoying a life of revelry, not of citizens who are doing their\\nduty to the state. but, if so, we mean different things, and he is\\nspeaking of something which is not a state. and therefore we must\\nconsider whether in appointing our guardians we would look to their\\ngreatest happiness individually, or whether this principle of happiness\\ndoes not rather reside in the state as a whole. but if the latter be\\nthe truth, then the guardians and auxiliaries, and all others equally\\nwith them, must be compelled or induced to do their own work in the\\nbest way. and thus the whole state will grow up in a noble order, and\\nthe several classes will receive the proportion of happiness which\\nnature assigns to them.\\n\\ni think that you are quite right.\\n\\ni wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to me.\\n\\nwhat may that be?\\n\\nthere seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts.\\n\\nwhat are they?\\n\\nwealth, i said, and poverty.\\n\\nhow do they act?\\n\\nthe process is as follows: when a potter becomes rich, will he, think\\nyou, any longer take the same pains with his art?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nhe will grow more and more indolent and careless?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand the result will be that he becomes a worse potter?\\n\\nyes; he greatly deteriorates.\\n\\nbut, on the other hand, if he has no money, and cannot provide himself\\nwith tools or instruments, he will not work equally well himself, nor\\nwill he teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well.\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nthen, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workmen and\\ntheir work are equally liable to degenerate?\\n\\nthat is evident.\\n\\nhere, then, is a discovery of new evils, i said, against which the\\nguardians will have to watch, or they will creep into the city\\nunobserved.\\n\\nwhat evils?\\n\\nwealth, i said, and poverty; the one is the parent of luxury and\\nindolence, and the other of meanness and viciousness, and both of\\ndiscontent.\\n\\nthat is very true, he replied; but still i should like to know,\\nsocrates, how our city will be able to go to war, especially against an\\nenemy who is rich and powerful, if deprived of the sinews of war.\\n\\nthere would certainly be a difficulty, i replied, in going to war with\\none such enemy; but there is no difficulty where there are two of them.\\n\\nhow so? he asked.\\n\\nin the first place, i said, if we have to fight, our side will be\\ntrained warriors fighting against an army of rich men.\\n\\nthat is true, he said.\\n\\nand do you not suppose, adeimantus, that a single boxer who was perfect\\nin his art would easily be a match for two stout and well-to-do\\ngentlemen who were not boxers?\\n\\nhardly, if they came upon him at once.\\n\\nwhat, now, i said, if he were able to run away and then turn and strike\\nat the one who first came up? and supposing he were to do this several\\ntimes under the heat of a scorching sun, might he not, being an expert,\\noverturn more than one stout personage?\\n\\ncertainly, he said, there would be nothing wonderful in that.\\n\\nand yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the science and\\npractise of boxing than they have in military qualities.\\n\\nlikely enough.\\n\\nthen we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or\\nthree times their own number?\\n\\ni agree with you, for i think you right.\\n\\nand suppose that, before engaging, our citizens send an embassy to one\\nof the two cities, telling them what is the truth: silver and gold we\\nneither have nor are permitted to have, but you may; do you therefore\\ncome and help us in war, and take the spoils of the other city: who, on\\nhearing these words, would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs,\\nrather than, with the dogs on their side, against fat and tender sheep?\\n\\nthat is not likely; and yet there might be a danger to the poor state\\nif the wealth of many states were to be gathered into one.\\n\\nbut how simple of you to use the term state at all of any but our own!\\n\\nwhy so?\\n\\nyou ought to speak of other states in the plural number; not one of\\nthem is a city, but many cities, as they say in the game. for indeed\\nany city, however small, is in fact divided into two, one the city of\\nthe poor, the other of the rich; these are at war with one another; and\\nin either there are many smaller divisions, and you would be altogether\\nbeside the mark if you treated them all as a single state. but if you\\ndeal with them as many, and give the wealth or power or persons of the\\none to the others, you will always have a great many friends and not\\nmany enemies. and your state, while the wise order which has now been\\nprescribed continues to prevail in her, will be the greatest of states,\\ni do not mean to say in reputation or appearance, but in deed and\\ntruth, though she number not more than a thousand defenders. a single\\nstate which is her equal you will hardly find, either among hellenes or\\nbarbarians, though many that appear to be as great and many times\\ngreater.\\n\\nthat is most true, he said.\\n\\nand what, i said, will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when\\nthey are considering the size of the state and the amount of territory\\nwhich they are to include, and beyond which they will not go?\\n\\nwhat limit would you propose?\\n\\ni would allow the state to increase so far as is consistent with unity;\\nthat, i think, is the proper limit.\\n\\nvery good, he said.\\n\\nhere then, i said, is another order which will have to be conveyed to\\nour guardians: let our city be accounted neither large nor small, but\\none and self-sufficing.\\n\\nand surely, said he, this is not a very severe order which we impose\\nupon them.\\n\\nand the other, said i, of which we were speaking before is lighter\\nstill,—i mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians when\\ninferior, and of elevating into the rank of guardians the offspring of\\nthe lower classes, when naturally superior. the intention was, that, in\\nthe case of the citizens generally, each individual should be put to\\nthe use for which nature intended him, one to one work, and then every\\nman would do his own business, and be one and not many; and so the\\nwhole city would be one and not many.\\n\\nyes, he said; that is not so difficult.\\n\\nthe regulations which we are prescribing, my good adeimantus, are not,\\nas might be supposed, a number of great principles, but trifles all, if\\ncare be taken, as the saying is, of the one great thing,—a thing,\\nhowever, which i would rather call, not great, but sufficient for our\\npurpose.\\n\\nwhat may that be? he asked.\\n\\neducation, i said, and nurture: if our citizens are well educated, and\\ngrow into sensible men, they will easily see their way through all\\nthese, as well as other matters which i omit; such, for example, as\\nmarriage, the possession of women and the procreation of children,\\nwhich will all follow the general principle that friends have all\\nthings in common, as the proverb says.\\n\\nthat will be the best way of settling them.\\n\\nalso, i said, the state, if once started well, moves with accumulating\\nforce like a wheel. for good nurture and education implant good\\nconstitutions, and these good constitutions taking root in a good\\neducation improve more and more, and this improvement affects the breed\\nin man as in other animals.\\n\\nvery possibly, he said.\\n\\nthen to sum up: this is the point to which, above all, the attention of\\nour rulers should be directed,—that music and gymnastic be preserved in\\ntheir original form, and no innovation made. they must do their utmost\\nto maintain them intact. and when any one says that mankind most regard\\n\\n‘the newest song which the singers have,’\\n\\nthey will be afraid that he may be praising, not new songs, but a new\\nkind of song; and this ought not to be praised, or conceived to be the\\nmeaning of the poet; for any musical innovation is full of danger to\\nthe whole state, and ought to be prohibited. so damon tells me, and i\\ncan quite believe him;—he says that when modes of music change, the\\nfundamental laws of the state always change with them.\\n\\nyes, said adeimantus; and you may add my suffrage to damon’s and your\\nown.\\n\\nthen, i said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress\\nin music?\\n\\nyes, he said; the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals in.\\n\\nyes, i replied, in the form of amusement; and at first sight it appears\\nharmless.\\n\\nwhy, yes, he said, and there is no harm; were it not that little by\\nlittle this spirit of licence, finding a home, imperceptibly penetrates\\ninto manners and customs; whence, issuing with greater force, it\\ninvades contracts between man and man, and from contracts goes on to\\nlaws and constitutions, in utter recklessness, ending at last,\\nsocrates, by an overthrow of all rights, private as well as public.\\n\\nis that true? i said.\\n\\nthat is my belief, he replied.\\n\\nthen, as i was saying, our youth should be trained from the first in a\\nstricter system, for if amusements become lawless, and the youths\\nthemselves become lawless, they can never grow up into well-conducted\\nand virtuous citizens.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nand when they have made a good beginning in play, and by the help of\\nmusic have gained the habit of good order, then this habit of order, in\\na manner how unlike the lawless play of the others! will accompany them\\nin all their actions and be a principle of growth to them, and if there\\nbe any fallen places in the state will raise them up again.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nthus educated, they will invent for themselves any lesser rules which\\ntheir predecessors have altogether neglected.\\n\\nwhat do you mean?\\n\\ni mean such things as these:—when the young are to be silent before\\ntheir elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and\\nmaking them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes\\nare to be worn; the mode of dressing the hair; deportment and manners\\nin general. you would agree with me?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nbut there is, i think, small wisdom in legislating about such\\nmatters,—i doubt if it is ever done; nor are any precise written\\nenactments about them likely to be lasting.\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nit would seem, adeimantus, that the direction in which education starts\\na man, will determine his future life. does not like always attract\\nlike?\\n\\nto be sure.\\n\\nuntil some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good, and\\nmay be the reverse of good?\\n\\nthat is not to be denied.\\n\\nand for this reason, i said, i shall not attempt to legislate further\\nabout them.\\n\\nnaturally enough, he replied.\\n\\nwell, and about the business of the agora, and the ordinary dealings\\nbetween man and man, or again about agreements with artisans; about\\ninsult and injury, or the commencement of actions, and the appointment\\nof juries, what would you say? there may also arise questions about any\\nimpositions and exactions of market and harbour dues which may be\\nrequired, and in general about the regulations of markets, police,\\nharbours, and the like. but, oh heavens! shall we condescend to\\nlegislate on any of these particulars?\\n\\ni think, he said, that there is no need to impose laws about them on\\ngood men; what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough\\nfor themselves.\\n\\nyes, i said, my friend, if god will only preserve to them the laws\\nwhich we have given them.\\n\\nand without divine help, said adeimantus, they will go on for ever\\nmaking and mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining\\nperfection.\\n\\nyou would compare them, i said, to those invalids who, having no\\nself-restraint, will not leave off their habits of intemperance?\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nyes, i said; and what a delightful life they lead! they are always\\ndoctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders, and always\\nfancying that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises\\nthem to try.\\n\\nsuch cases are very common, he said, with invalids of this sort.\\n\\nyes, i replied; and the charming thing is that they deem him their\\nworst enemy who tells them the truth, which is simply that, unless they\\ngive up eating and drinking and wenching and idling, neither drug nor\\ncautery nor spell nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail.\\n\\ncharming! he replied. i see nothing charming in going into a passion\\nwith a man who tells you what is right.\\n\\nthese gentlemen, i said, do not seem to be in your good graces.\\n\\nassuredly not.\\n\\nnor would you praise the behaviour of states which act like the men\\nwhom i was just now describing. for are there not ill-ordered states in\\nwhich the citizens are forbidden under pain of death to alter the\\nconstitution; and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under\\nthis regime and indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in\\nanticipating and gratifying their humours is held to be a great and\\ngood statesman—do not these states resemble the persons whom i was\\ndescribing?\\n\\nyes, he said; the states are as bad as the men; and i am very far from\\npraising them.\\n\\nbut do you not admire, i said, the coolness and dexterity of these\\nready ministers of political corruption?\\n\\nyes, he said, i do; but not of all of them, for there are some whom the\\napplause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are\\nreally statesmen, and these are not much to be admired.\\n\\nwhat do you mean? i said; you should have more feeling for them. when a\\nman cannot measure, and a great many others who cannot measure declare\\nthat he is four cubits high, can he help believing what they say?\\n\\nnay, he said, certainly not in that case.\\n\\nwell, then, do not be angry with them; for are they not as good as a\\nplay, trying their hand at paltry reforms such as i was describing;\\nthey are always fancying that by legislation they will make an end of\\nfrauds in contracts, and the other rascalities which i was mentioning,\\nnot knowing that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra?\\n\\nyes, he said; that is just what they are doing.\\n\\ni conceive, i said, that the true legislator will not trouble himself\\nwith this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the\\nconstitution either in an ill-ordered or in a well-ordered state; for\\nin the former they are quite useless, and in the latter there will be\\nno difficulty in devising them; and many of them will naturally flow\\nout of our previous regulations.\\n\\nwhat, then, he said, is still remaining to us of the work of\\nlegislation?\\n\\nnothing to us, i replied; but to apollo, the god of delphi, there\\nremains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of\\nall.\\n\\nwhich are they? he said.\\n\\nthe institution of temples and sacrifices, and the entire service of\\ngods, demigods, and heroes; also the ordering of the repositories of\\nthe dead, and the rites which have to be observed by him who would\\npropitiate the inhabitants of the world below. these are matters of\\nwhich we are ignorant ourselves, and as founders of a city we should be\\nunwise in trusting them to any interpreter but our ancestral deity. he\\nis the god who sits in the centre, on the navel of the earth, and he is\\nthe interpreter of religion to all mankind.\\n\\nyou are right, and we will do as you propose.\\n\\nbut where, amid all this, is justice? son of ariston, tell me where.\\nnow that our city has been made habitable, light a candle and search,\\nand get your brother and polemarchus and the rest of our friends to\\nhelp, and let us see where in it we can discover justice and where\\ninjustice, and in what they differ from one another, and which of them\\nthe man who would be happy should have for his portion, whether seen or\\nunseen by gods and men.\\n\\nnonsense, said glaucon: did you not promise to search yourself, saying\\nthat for you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety?\\n\\ni do not deny that i said so, and as you remind me, i will be as good\\nas my word; but you must join.\\n\\nwe will, he replied.\\n\\nwell, then, i hope to make the discovery in this way: i mean to begin\\nwith the assumption that our state, if rightly ordered, is perfect.\\n\\nthat is most certain.\\n\\nand being perfect, is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and\\njust.\\n\\nthat is likewise clear.\\n\\nand whichever of these qualities we find in the state, the one which is\\nnot found will be the residue?\\n\\nvery good.\\n\\nif there were four things, and we were searching for one of them,\\nwherever it might be, the one sought for might be known to us from the\\nfirst, and there would be no further trouble; or we might know the\\nother three first, and then the fourth would clearly be the one left.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nand is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues, which are\\nalso four in number?\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nfirst among the virtues found in the state, wisdom comes into view, and\\nin this i detect a certain peculiarity.\\n\\nwhat is that?\\n\\nthe state which we have been describing is said to be wise as being\\ngood in counsel?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance,\\nbut by knowledge, do men counsel well?\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nand the kinds of knowledge in a state are many and diverse?\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nthere is the knowledge of the carpenter; but is that the sort of\\nknowledge which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel?\\n\\ncertainly not; that would only give a city the reputation of skill in\\ncarpentering.\\n\\nthen a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge\\nwhich counsels for the best about wooden implements?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nnor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, i said,\\nnor as possessing any other similar knowledge?\\n\\nnot by reason of any of them, he said.\\n\\nnor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth; that would\\ngive the city the name of agricultural?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nwell, i said, and is there any knowledge in our recently-founded state\\namong any of the citizens which advises, not about any particular thing\\nin the state, but about the whole, and considers how a state can best\\ndeal with itself and with other states?\\n\\nthere certainly is.\\n\\nand what is this knowledge, and among whom is it found? i asked.\\n\\nit is the knowledge of the guardians, he replied, and is found among\\nthose whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians.\\n\\nand what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this\\nsort of knowledge?\\n\\nthe name of good in counsel and truly wise.\\n\\nand will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more\\nsmiths?\\n\\nthe smiths, he replied, will be far more numerous.\\n\\nwill not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a\\nname from the profession of some kind of knowledge?\\n\\nmuch the smallest.\\n\\nand so by reason of the smallest part or class, and of the knowledge\\nwhich resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself, the whole\\nstate, being thus constituted according to nature, will be wise; and\\nthis, which has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom, has been\\nordained by nature to be of all classes the least.\\n\\nmost true.\\n\\nthus, then, i said, the nature and place in the state of one of the\\nfour virtues has somehow or other been discovered.\\n\\nand, in my humble opinion, very satisfactorily discovered, he replied.\\n\\nagain, i said, there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of courage,\\nand in what part that quality resides which gives the name of\\ncourageous to the state.\\n\\nhow do you mean?\\n\\nwhy, i said, every one who calls any state courageous or cowardly, will\\nbe thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the state’s\\nbehalf.\\n\\nno one, he replied, would ever think of any other.\\n\\nthe rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly, but\\ntheir courage or cowardice will not, as i conceive, have the effect of\\nmaking the city either the one or the other.\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nthe city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which\\npreserves under all circumstances that opinion about the nature of\\nthings to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator\\neducated them; and this is what you term courage.\\n\\ni should like to hear what you are saying once more, for i do not think\\nthat i perfectly understand you.\\n\\ni mean that courage is a kind of salvation.\\n\\nsalvation of what?\\n\\nof the opinion respecting things to be feared, what they are and of\\nwhat nature, which the law implants through education; and i mean by\\nthe words ‘under all circumstances’ to intimate that in pleasure or in\\npain, or under the influence of desire or fear, a man preserves, and\\ndoes not lose this opinion. shall i give you an illustration?\\n\\nif you please.\\n\\nyou know, i said, that dyers, when they want to dye wool for making the\\ntrue sea-purple, begin by selecting their white colour first; this they\\nprepare and dress with much care and pains, in order that the white\\nground may take the purple hue in full perfection. the dyeing then\\nproceeds; and whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast colour,\\nand no washing either with lyes or without them can take away the\\nbloom. but, when the ground has not been duly prepared, you will have\\nnoticed how poor is the look either of purple or of any other colour.\\n\\nyes, he said; i know that they have a washed-out and ridiculous\\nappearance.\\n\\nthen now, i said, you will understand what our object was in selecting\\nour soldiers, and educating them in music and gymnastic; we were\\ncontriving influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the\\nlaws in perfection, and the colour of their opinion about dangers and\\nof every other opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture and\\ntraining, not to be washed away by such potent lyes as\\npleasure—mightier agent far in washing the soul than any soda or lye;\\nor by sorrow, fear, and desire, the mightiest of all other solvents.\\nand this sort of universal saving power of true opinion in conformity\\nwith law about real and false dangers i call and maintain to be\\ncourage, unless you disagree.\\n\\nbut i agree, he replied; for i suppose that you mean to exclude mere\\nuninstructed courage, such as that of a wild beast or of a slave—this,\\nin your opinion, is not the courage which the law ordains, and ought to\\nhave another name.\\n\\nmost certainly.\\n\\nthen i may infer courage to be such as you describe?\\n\\nwhy, yes, said i, you may, and if you add the words ‘of a citizen,’ you\\nwill not be far wrong;—hereafter, if you like, we will carry the\\nexamination further, but at present we are seeking not for courage but\\njustice; and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough.\\n\\nyou are right, he replied.\\n\\ntwo virtues remain to be discovered in the state—first, temperance, and\\nthen justice which is the end of our search.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nnow, can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance?\\n\\ni do not know how that can be accomplished, he said, nor do i desire\\nthat justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of;\\nand therefore i wish that you would do me the favour of considering\\ntemperance first.\\n\\ncertainly, i replied, i should not be justified in refusing your\\nrequest.\\n\\nthen consider, he said.\\n\\nyes, i replied; i will; and as far as i can at present see, the virtue\\nof temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than the\\npreceding.\\n\\nhow so? he asked.\\n\\ntemperance, i replied, is the ordering or controlling of certain\\npleasures and desires; this is curiously enough implied in the saying\\nof ‘a man being his own master;’ and other traces of the same notion\\nmay be found in language.\\n\\nno doubt, he said.\\n\\nthere is something ridiculous in the expression ‘master of himself;’\\nfor the master is also the servant and the servant the master; and in\\nall these modes of speaking the same person is denoted.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nthe meaning is, i believe, that in the human soul there is a better and\\nalso a worse principle; and when the better has the worse under\\ncontrol, then a man is said to be master of himself; and this is a term\\nof praise: but when, owing to evil education or association, the better\\nprinciple, which is also the smaller, is overwhelmed by the greater\\nmass of the worse—in this case he is blamed and is called the slave of\\nself and unprincipled.\\n\\nyes, there is reason in that.\\n\\nand now, i said, look at our newly-created state, and there you will\\nfind one of these two conditions realized; for the state, as you will\\nacknowledge, may be justly called master of itself, if the words\\n‘temperance’ and ‘self-mastery’ truly express the rule of the better\\npart over the worse.\\n\\nyes, he said, i see that what you say is true.\\n\\nlet me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires\\nand pains are generally found in children and women and servants, and\\nin the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class.\\n\\ncertainly, he said.\\n\\nwhereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason, and are\\nunder the guidance of mind and true opinion, are to be found only in a\\nfew, and those the best born and best educated.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nthese two, as you may perceive, have a place in our state; and the\\nmeaner desires of the many are held down by the virtuous desires and\\nwisdom of the few.\\n\\nthat i perceive, he said.\\n\\nthen if there be any city which may be described as master of its own\\npleasures and desires, and master of itself, ours may claim such a\\ndesignation?\\n\\ncertainly, he replied.\\n\\nit may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand if there be any state in which rulers and subjects will be agreed\\nas to the question who are to rule, that again will be our state?\\n\\nundoubtedly.\\n\\nand the citizens being thus agreed among themselves, in which class\\nwill temperance be found—in the rulers or in the subjects?\\n\\nin both, as i should imagine, he replied.\\n\\ndo you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance\\nwas a sort of harmony?\\n\\nwhy so?\\n\\nwhy, because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom, each of which\\nresides in a part only, the one making the state wise and the other\\nvaliant; not so temperance, which extends to the whole, and runs\\nthrough all the notes of the scale, and produces a harmony of the\\nweaker and the stronger and the middle class, whether you suppose them\\nto be stronger or weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth, or\\nanything else. most truly then may we deem temperance to be the\\nagreement of the naturally superior and inferior, as to the right to\\nrule of either, both in states and individuals.\\n\\ni entirely agree with you.\\n\\nand so, i said, we may consider three out of the four virtues to have\\nbeen discovered in our state. the last of those qualities which make a\\nstate virtuous must be justice, if we only knew what that was.\\n\\nthe inference is obvious.\\n\\nthe time then has arrived, glaucon, when, like huntsmen, we should\\nsurround the cover, and look sharp that justice does not steal away,\\nand pass out of sight and escape us; for beyond a doubt she is\\nsomewhere in this country: watch therefore and strive to catch a sight\\nof her, and if you see her first, let me know.\\n\\nwould that i could! but you should regard me rather as a follower who\\nhas just eyes enough to see what you show him—that is about as much as\\ni am good for.\\n\\noffer up a prayer with me and follow.\\n\\ni will, but you must show me the way.\\n\\nhere is no path, i said, and the wood is dark and perplexing; still we\\nmust push on.\\n\\nlet us push on.\\n\\nhere i saw something: halloo! i said, i begin to perceive a track, and\\ni believe that the quarry will not escape.\\n\\ngood news, he said.\\n\\ntruly, i said, we are stupid fellows.\\n\\nwhy so?\\n\\nwhy, my good sir, at the beginning of our enquiry, ages ago, there was\\njustice tumbling out at our feet, and we never saw her; nothing could\\nbe more ridiculous. like people who go about looking for what they have\\nin their hands—that was the way with us—we looked not at what we were\\nseeking, but at what was far off in the distance; and therefore, i\\nsuppose, we missed her.\\n\\nwhat do you mean?\\n\\ni mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking\\nof justice, and have failed to recognise her.\\n\\ni grow impatient at the length of your exordium.\\n\\nwell then, tell me, i said, whether i am right or not: you remember the\\noriginal principle which we were always laying down at the foundation\\nof the state, that one man should practise one thing only, the thing to\\nwhich his nature was best adapted;—now justice is this principle or a\\npart of it.\\n\\nyes, we often said that one man should do one thing only.\\n\\nfurther, we affirmed that justice was doing one’s own business, and not\\nbeing a busybody; we said so again and again, and many others have said\\nthe same to us.\\n\\nyes, we said so.\\n\\nthen to do one’s own business in a certain way may be assumed to be\\njustice. can you tell me whence i derive this inference?\\n\\ni cannot, but i should like to be told.\\n\\nbecause i think that this is the only virtue which remains in the state\\nwhen the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom are\\nabstracted; and, that this is the ultimate cause and condition of the\\nexistence of all of them, and while remaining in them is also their\\npreservative; and we were saying that if the three were discovered by\\nus, justice would be the fourth or remaining one.\\n\\nthat follows of necessity.\\n\\nif we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its\\npresence contributes most to the excellence of the state, whether the\\nagreement of rulers and subjects, or the preservation in the soldiers\\nof the opinion which the law ordains about the true nature of dangers,\\nor wisdom and watchfulness in the rulers, or whether this other which i\\nam mentioning, and which is found in children and women, slave and\\nfreeman, artisan, ruler, subject,—the quality, i mean, of every one\\ndoing his own work, and not being a busybody, would claim the palm—the\\nquestion is not so easily answered.\\n\\ncertainly, he replied, there would be a difficulty in saying which.\\n\\nthen the power of each individual in the state to do his own work\\nappears to compete with the other political virtues, wisdom,\\ntemperance, courage.\\n\\nyes, he said.\\n\\nand the virtue which enters into this competition is justice?\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nlet us look at the question from another point of view: are not the\\nrulers in a state those to whom you would entrust the office of\\ndetermining suits at law?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither\\ntake what is another’s, nor be deprived of what is his own?\\n\\nyes; that is their principle.\\n\\nwhich is a just principle?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthen on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and\\ndoing what is a man’s own, and belongs to him?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nthink, now, and say whether you agree with me or not. suppose a\\ncarpenter to be doing the business of a cobbler, or a cobbler of a\\ncarpenter; and suppose them to exchange their implements or their\\nduties, or the same person to be doing the work of both, or whatever be\\nthe change; do you think that any great harm would result to the state?\\n\\nnot much.\\n\\nbut when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a\\ntrader, having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number\\nof his followers, or any like advantage, attempts to force his way into\\nthe class of warriors, or a warrior into that of legislators and\\nguardians, for which he is unfitted, and either to take the implements\\nor the duties of the other; or when one man is trader, legislator, and\\nwarrior all in one, then i think you will agree with me in saying that\\nthis interchange and this meddling of one with another is the ruin of\\nthe state.\\n\\nmost true.\\n\\nseeing then, i said, that there are three distinct classes, any\\nmeddling of one with another, or the change of one into another, is the\\ngreatest harm to the state, and may be most justly termed evil-doing?\\n\\nprecisely.\\n\\nand the greatest degree of evil-doing to one’s own city would be termed\\nby you injustice?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nthis then is injustice; and on the other hand when the trader, the\\nauxiliary, and the guardian each do their own business, that is\\njustice, and will make the city just.\\n\\ni agree with you.\\n\\nwe will not, i said, be over-positive as yet; but if, on trial, this\\nconception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in the\\nstate, there will be no longer any room for doubt; if it be not\\nverified, we must have a fresh enquiry. first let us complete the old\\ninvestigation, which we began, as you remember, under the impression\\nthat, if we could previously examine justice on the larger scale, there\\nwould be less difficulty in discerning her in the individual. that\\nlarger example appeared to be the state, and accordingly we constructed\\nas good a one as we could, knowing well that in the good state justice\\nwould be found. let the discovery which we made be now applied to the\\nindividual—if they agree, we shall be satisfied; or, if there be a\\ndifference in the individual, we will come back to the state and have\\nanother trial of the theory. the friction of the two when rubbed\\ntogether may possibly strike a light in which justice will shine forth,\\nand the vision which is then revealed we will fix in our souls.\\n\\nthat will be in regular course; let us do as you say.\\n\\ni proceeded to ask: when two things, a greater and less, are called by\\nthe same name, are they like or unlike in so far as they are called the\\nsame?\\n\\nlike, he replied.\\n\\nthe just man then, if we regard the idea of justice only, will be like\\nthe just state?\\n\\nhe will.\\n\\nand a state was thought by us to be just when the three classes in the\\nstate severally did their own business; and also thought to be\\ntemperate and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections\\nand qualities of these same classes?\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nand so of the individual; we may assume that he has the same three\\nprinciples in his own soul which are found in the state; and he may be\\nrightly described in the same terms, because he is affected in the same\\nmanner?\\n\\ncertainly, he said.\\n\\nonce more then, o my friend, we have alighted upon an easy\\nquestion—whether the soul has these three principles or not?\\n\\nan easy question! nay, rather, socrates, the proverb holds that hard is\\nthe good.\\n\\nvery true, i said; and i do not think that the method which we are\\nemploying is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question;\\nthe true method is another and a longer one. still we may arrive at a\\nsolution not below the level of the previous enquiry.\\n\\nmay we not be satisfied with that? he said;—under the circumstances, i\\nam quite content.\\n\\ni too, i replied, shall be extremely well satisfied.\\n\\nthen faint not in pursuing the speculation, he said.\\n\\nmust we not acknowledge, i said, that in each of us there are the same\\nprinciples and habits which there are in the state; and that from the\\nindividual they pass into the state?—how else can they come there? take\\nthe quality of passion or spirit;—it would be ridiculous to imagine\\nthat this quality, when found in states, is not derived from the\\nindividuals who are supposed to possess it, e.g. the thracians,\\nscythians, and in general the northern nations; and the same may be\\nsaid of the love of knowledge, which is the special characteristic of\\nour part of the world, or of the love of money, which may, with equal\\ntruth, be attributed to the phoenicians and egyptians.\\n\\nexactly so, he said.\\n\\nthere is no difficulty in understanding this.\\n\\nnone whatever.\\n\\nbut the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether\\nthese principles are three or one; whether, that is to say, we learn\\nwith one part of our nature, are angry with another, and with a third\\npart desire the satisfaction of our natural appetites; or whether the\\nwhole soul comes into play in each sort of action—to determine that is\\nthe difficulty.\\n\\nyes, he said; there lies the difficulty.\\n\\nthen let us now try and determine whether they are the same or\\ndifferent.\\n\\nhow can we? he asked.\\n\\ni replied as follows: the same thing clearly cannot act or be acted\\nupon in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same\\ntime, in contrary ways; and therefore whenever this contradiction\\noccurs in things apparently the same, we know that they are really not\\nthe same, but different.\\n\\ngood.\\n\\nfor example, i said, can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the\\nsame time in the same part?\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nstill, i said, let us have a more precise statement of terms, lest we\\nshould hereafter fall out by the way. imagine the case of a man who is\\nstanding and also moving his hands and his head, and suppose a person\\nto say that one and the same person is in motion and at rest at the\\nsame moment—to such a mode of speech we should object, and should\\nrather say that one part of him is in motion while another is at rest.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand suppose the objector to refine still further, and to draw the nice\\ndistinction that not only parts of tops, but whole tops, when they spin\\nround with their pegs fixed on the spot, are at rest and in motion at\\nthe same time (and he may say the same of anything which revolves in\\nthe same spot), his objection would not be admitted by us, because in\\nsuch cases things are not at rest and in motion in the same parts of\\nthemselves; we should rather say that they have both an axis and a\\ncircumference, and that the axis stands still, for there is no\\ndeviation from the perpendicular; and that the circumference goes\\nround. but if, while revolving, the axis inclines either to the right\\nor left, forwards or backwards, then in no point of view can they be at\\nrest.\\n\\nthat is the correct mode of describing them, he replied.\\n\\nthen none of these objections will confuse us, or incline us to believe\\nthat the same thing at the same time, in the same part or in relation\\nto the same thing, can act or be acted upon in contrary ways.\\n\\ncertainly not, according to my way of thinking.\\n\\nyet, i said, that we may not be compelled to examine all such\\nobjections, and prove at length that they are untrue, let us assume\\ntheir absurdity, and go forward on the understanding that hereafter, if\\nthis assumption turn out to be untrue, all the consequences which\\nfollow shall be withdrawn.\\n\\nyes, he said, that will be the best way.\\n\\nwell, i said, would you not allow that assent and dissent, desire and\\naversion, attraction and repulsion, are all of them opposites, whether\\nthey are regarded as active or passive (for that makes no difference in\\nthe fact of their opposition)?\\n\\nyes, he said, they are opposites.\\n\\nwell, i said, and hunger and thirst, and the desires in general, and\\nagain willing and wishing,—all these you would refer to the classes\\nalready mentioned. you would say—would you not?—that the soul of him\\nwho desires is seeking after the object of his desire; or that he is\\ndrawing to himself the thing which he wishes to possess: or again, when\\na person wants anything to be given him, his mind, longing for the\\nrealization of his desire, intimates his wish to have it by a nod of\\nassent, as if he had been asked a question?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence of\\ndesire; should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion\\nand rejection?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nadmitting this to be true of desire generally, let us suppose a\\nparticular class of desires, and out of these we will select hunger and\\nthirst, as they are termed, which are the most obvious of them?\\n\\nlet us take that class, he said.\\n\\nthe object of one is food, and of the other drink?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand here comes the point: is not thirst the desire which the soul has\\nof drink, and of drink only; not of drink qualified by anything else;\\nfor example, warm or cold, or much or little, or, in a word, drink of\\nany particular sort: but if the thirst be accompanied by heat, then the\\ndesire is of cold drink; or, if accompanied by cold, then of warm\\ndrink; or, if the thirst be excessive, then the drink which is desired\\nwill be excessive; or, if not great, the quantity of drink will also be\\nsmall: but thirst pure and simple will desire drink pure and simple,\\nwhich is the natural satisfaction of thirst, as food is of hunger?\\n\\nyes, he said; the simple desire is, as you say, in every case of the\\nsimple object, and the qualified desire of the qualified object.\\n\\nbut here a confusion may arise; and i should wish to guard against an\\nopponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only, but\\ngood drink, or food only, but good food; for good is the universal\\nobject of desire, and thirst being a desire, will necessarily be thirst\\nafter good drink; and the same is true of every other desire.\\n\\nyes, he replied, the opponent might have something to say.\\n\\nnevertheless i should still maintain, that of relatives some have a\\nquality attached to either term of the relation; others are simple and\\nhave their correlatives simple.\\n\\ni do not know what you mean.\\n\\nwell, you know of course that the greater is relative to the less?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand the much greater to the much less?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand the sometime greater to the sometime less, and the greater that is\\nto be to the less that is to be?\\n\\ncertainly, he said.\\n\\nand so of more and less, and of other correlative terms, such as the\\ndouble and the half, or again, the heavier and the lighter, the swifter\\nand the slower; and of hot and cold, and of any other relatives;—is not\\nthis true of all of them?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand does not the same principle hold in the sciences? the object of\\nscience is knowledge (assuming that to be the true definition), but the\\nobject of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge; i\\nmean, for example, that the science of house-building is a kind of\\nknowledge which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and is\\ntherefore termed architecture.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nbecause it has a particular quality which no other has?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand it has this particular quality because it has an object of a\\nparticular kind; and this is true of the other arts and sciences?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nnow, then, if i have made myself clear, you will understand my original\\nmeaning in what i said about relatives. my meaning was, that if one\\nterm of a relation is taken alone, the other is taken alone; if one\\nterm is qualified, the other is also qualified. i do not mean to say\\nthat relatives may not be disparate, or that the science of health is\\nhealthy, or of disease necessarily diseased, or that the sciences of\\ngood and evil are therefore good and evil; but only that, when the term\\nscience is no longer used absolutely, but has a qualified object which\\nin this case is the nature of health and disease, it becomes defined,\\nand is hence called not merely science, but the science of medicine.\\n\\ni quite understand, and i think as you do.\\n\\nwould you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative\\nterms, having clearly a relation—\\n\\nyes, thirst is relative to drink.\\n\\nand a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink;\\nbut thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little, nor of good nor\\nbad, nor of any particular kind of drink, but of drink only?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nthen the soul of the thirsty one, in so far as he is thirsty, desires\\nonly drink; for this he yearns and tries to obtain it?\\n\\nthat is plain.\\n\\nand if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from\\ndrink, that must be different from the thirsty principle which draws\\nhim like a beast to drink; for, as we were saying, the same thing\\ncannot at the same time with the same part of itself act in contrary\\nways about the same.\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nno more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and pull the\\nbow at the same time, but what you say is that one hand pushes and the\\nother pulls.\\n\\nexactly so, he replied.\\n\\nand might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink?\\n\\nyes, he said, it constantly happens.\\n\\nand in such a case what is one to say? would you not say that there was\\nsomething in the soul bidding a man to drink, and something else\\nforbidding him, which is other and stronger than the principle which\\nbids him?\\n\\ni should say so.\\n\\nand the forbidding principle is derived from reason, and that which\\nbids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease?\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nthen we may fairly assume that they are two, and that they differ from\\none another; the one with which a man reasons, we may call the rational\\nprinciple of the soul, the other, with which he loves and hungers and\\nthirsts and feels the flutterings of any other desire, may be termed\\nthe irrational or appetitive, the ally of sundry pleasures and\\nsatisfactions?\\n\\nyes, he said, we may fairly assume them to be different.\\n\\nthen let us finally determine that there are two principles existing in\\nthe soul. and what of passion, or spirit? is it a third, or akin to one\\nof the preceding?\\n\\ni should be inclined to say—akin to desire.\\n\\nwell, i said, there is a story which i remember to have heard, and in\\nwhich i put faith. the story is, that leontius, the son of aglaion,\\ncoming up one day from the piraeus, under the north wall on the\\noutside, observed some dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of\\nexecution. he felt a desire to see them, and also a dread and\\nabhorrence of them; for a time he struggled and covered his eyes, but\\nat length the desire got the better of him; and forcing them open, he\\nran up to the dead bodies, saying, look, ye wretches, take your fill of\\nthe fair sight.\\n\\ni have heard the story myself, he said.\\n\\nthe moral of the tale is, that anger at times goes to war with desire,\\nas though they were two distinct things.\\n\\nyes; that is the meaning, he said.\\n\\nand are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a\\nman’s desires violently prevail over his reason, he reviles himself,\\nand is angry at the violence within him, and that in this struggle,\\nwhich is like the struggle of factions in a state, his spirit is on the\\nside of his reason;—but for the passionate or spirited element to take\\npart with the desires when reason decides that she should not be\\nopposed, is a sort of thing which i believe that you never observed\\noccurring in yourself, nor, as i should imagine, in any one else?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nsuppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another, the nobler he\\nis the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering, such as\\nhunger, or cold, or any other pain which the injured person may inflict\\nupon him—these he deems to be just, and, as i say, his anger refuses to\\nbe excited by them.\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nbut when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong, then he boils\\nand chafes, and is on the side of what he believes to be justice; and\\nbecause he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more\\ndetermined to persevere and conquer. his noble spirit will not be\\nquelled until he either slays or is slain; or until he hears the voice\\nof the shepherd, that is, reason, bidding his dog bark no more.\\n\\nthe illustration is perfect, he replied; and in our state, as we were\\nsaying, the auxiliaries were to be dogs, and to hear the voice of the\\nrulers, who are their shepherds.\\n\\ni perceive, i said, that you quite understand me; there is, however, a\\nfurther point which i wish you to consider.\\n\\nwhat point?\\n\\nyou remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a\\nkind of desire, but now we should say quite the contrary; for in the\\nconflict of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational\\nprinciple.\\n\\nmost assuredly.\\n\\nbut a further question arises: is passion different from reason also,\\nor only a kind of reason; in which latter case, instead of three\\nprinciples in the soul, there will only be two, the rational and the\\nconcupiscent; or rather, as the state was composed of three classes,\\ntraders, auxiliaries, counsellors, so may there not be in the\\nindividual soul a third element which is passion or spirit, and when\\nnot corrupted by bad education is the natural auxiliary of reason?\\n\\nyes, he said, there must be a third.\\n\\nyes, i replied, if passion, which has already been shown to be\\ndifferent from desire, turn out also to be different from reason.\\n\\nbut that is easily proved:—we may observe even in young children that\\nthey are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born, whereas some\\nof them never seem to attain to the use of reason, and most of them\\nlate enough.\\n\\nexcellent, i said, and you may see passion equally in brute animals,\\nwhich is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying. and we\\nmay once more appeal to the words of homer, which have been already\\nquoted by us,\\n\\n‘he smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul,’\\n\\nfor in this verse homer has clearly supposed the power which reasons\\nabout the better and worse to be different from the unreasoning anger\\nwhich is rebuked by it.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nand so, after much tossing, we have reached land, and are fairly agreed\\nthat the same principles which exist in the state exist also in the\\nindividual, and that they are three in number.\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nmust we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way, and\\nin virtue of the same quality which makes the state wise?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nalso that the same quality which constitutes courage in the state\\nconstitutes courage in the individual, and that both the state and the\\nindividual bear the same relation to all the other virtues?\\n\\nassuredly.\\n\\nand the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same\\nway in which the state is just?\\n\\nthat follows, of course.\\n\\nwe cannot but remember that the justice of the state consisted in each\\nof the three classes doing the work of its own class?\\n\\nwe are not very likely to have forgotten, he said.\\n\\nwe must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of\\nhis nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own work?\\n\\nyes, he said, we must remember that too.\\n\\nand ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care\\nof the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to\\nbe the subject and ally?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand, as we were saying, the united influence of music and gymnastic\\nwill bring them into accord, nerving and sustaining the reason with\\nnoble words and lessons, and moderating and soothing and civilizing the\\nwildness of passion by harmony and rhythm?\\n\\nquite true, he said.\\n\\nand these two, thus nurtured and educated, and having learned truly to\\nknow their own functions, will rule over the concupiscent, which in\\neach of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most\\ninsatiable of gain; over this they will keep guard, lest, waxing great\\nand strong with the fulness of bodily pleasures, as they are termed,\\nthe concupiscent soul, no longer confined to her own sphere, should\\nattempt to enslave and rule those who are not her natural-born\\nsubjects, and overturn the whole life of man?\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nboth together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul and\\nthe whole body against attacks from without; the one counselling, and\\nthe other fighting under his leader, and courageously executing his\\ncommands and counsels?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and\\nin pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to\\nfear?\\n\\nright, he replied.\\n\\nand him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules, and\\nwhich proclaims these commands; that part too being supposed to have a\\nknowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of\\nthe whole?\\n\\nassuredly.\\n\\nand would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements\\nin friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and\\nthe two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that\\nreason ought to rule, and do not rebel?\\n\\ncertainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether in\\nthe state or individual.\\n\\nand surely, i said, we have explained again and again how and by virtue\\nof what quality a man will be just.\\n\\nthat is very certain.\\n\\nand is justice dimmer in the individual, and is her form different, or\\nis she the same which we found her to be in the state?\\n\\nthere is no difference in my opinion, he said.\\n\\nbecause, if any doubt is still lingering in our minds, a few\\ncommonplace instances will satisfy us of the truth of what i am saying.\\n\\nwhat sort of instances do you mean?\\n\\nif the case is put to us, must we not admit that the just state, or the\\nman who is trained in the principles of such a state, will be less\\nlikely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver?\\nwould any one deny this?\\n\\nno one, he replied.\\n\\nwill the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft, or\\ntreachery either to his friends or to his country?\\n\\nnever.\\n\\nneither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or\\nagreements?\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nno one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his\\nfather and mother, or to fail in his religious duties?\\n\\nno one.\\n\\nand the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business,\\nwhether in ruling or being ruled?\\n\\nexactly so.\\n\\nare you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such\\nstates is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?\\n\\nnot i, indeed.\\n\\nthen our dream has been realized; and the suspicion which we\\nentertained at the beginning of our work of construction, that some\\ndivine power must have conducted us to a primary form of justice, has\\nnow been verified?\\n\\nyes, certainly.\\n\\nand the division of labour which required the carpenter and the\\nshoemaker and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own\\nbusiness, and not another’s, was a shadow of justice, and for that\\nreason it was of use?\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nbut in reality justice was such as we were describing, being concerned\\nhowever, not with the outward man, but with the inward, which is the\\ntrue self and concernment of man: for the just man does not permit the\\nseveral elements within him to interfere with one another, or any of\\nthem to do the work of others,—he sets in order his own inner life, and\\nis his own master and his own law, and at peace with himself; and when\\nhe has bound together the three principles within him, which may be\\ncompared to the higher, lower, and middle notes of the scale, and the\\nintermediate intervals—when he has bound all these together, and is no\\nlonger many, but has become one entirely temperate and perfectly\\nadjusted nature, then he proceeds to act, if he has to act, whether in\\na matter of property, or in the treatment of the body, or in some\\naffair of politics or private business; always thinking and calling\\nthat which preserves and co-operates with this harmonious condition,\\njust and good action, and the knowledge which presides over it, wisdom,\\nand that which at any time impairs this condition, he will call unjust\\naction, and the opinion which presides over it ignorance.\\n\\nyou have said the exact truth, socrates.\\n\\nvery good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man\\nand the just state, and the nature of justice in each of them, we\\nshould not be telling a falsehood?\\n\\nmost certainly not.\\n\\nmay we say so, then?\\n\\nlet us say so.\\n\\nand now, i said, injustice has to be considered.\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nmust not injustice be a strife which arises among the three\\nprinciples—a meddlesomeness, and interference, and rising up of a part\\nof the soul against the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority,\\nwhich is made by a rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he\\nis the natural vassal,—what is all this confusion and delusion but\\ninjustice, and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance, and every form\\nof vice?\\n\\nexactly so.\\n\\nand if the nature of justice and injustice be known, then the meaning\\nof acting unjustly and being unjust, or, again, of acting justly, will\\nalso be perfectly clear?\\n\\nwhat do you mean? he said.\\n\\nwhy, i said, they are like disease and health; being in the soul just\\nwhat disease and health are in the body.\\n\\nhow so? he said.\\n\\nwhy, i said, that which is healthy causes health, and that which is\\nunhealthy causes disease.\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause injustice?\\n\\nthat is certain.\\n\\nand the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and\\ngovernment of one by another in the parts of the body; and the creation\\nof disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this\\nnatural order?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order\\nand government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the\\ncreation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance\\nwith the natural order?\\n\\nexactly so, he said.\\n\\nthen virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the soul, and\\nvice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to vice?\\n\\nassuredly.\\n\\nstill our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and\\ninjustice has not been answered: which is the more profitable, to be\\njust and act justly and practise virtue, whether seen or unseen of gods\\nand men, or to be unjust and act unjustly, if only unpunished and\\nunreformed?\\n\\nin my judgment, socrates, the question has now become ridiculous. we\\nknow that, when the bodily constitution is gone, life is no longer\\nendurable, though pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks, and\\nhaving all wealth and all power; and shall we be told that when the\\nvery essence of the vital principle is undermined and corrupted, life\\nis still worth having to a man, if only he be allowed to do whatever he\\nlikes with the single exception that he is not to acquire justice and\\nvirtue, or to escape from injustice and vice; assuming them both to be\\nsuch as we have described?\\n\\nyes, i said, the question is, as you say, ridiculous. still, as we are\\nnear the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner with\\nour own eyes, let us not faint by the way.\\n\\ncertainly not, he replied.\\n\\ncome up hither, i said, and behold the various forms of vice, those of\\nthem, i mean, which are worth looking at.\\n\\ni am following you, he replied: proceed.\\n\\ni said, the argument seems to have reached a height from which, as from\\nsome tower of speculation, a man may look down and see that virtue is\\none, but that the forms of vice are innumerable; there being four\\nspecial ones which are deserving of note.\\n\\nwhat do you mean? he said.\\n\\ni mean, i replied, that there appear to be as many forms of the soul as\\nthere are distinct forms of the state.\\n\\nhow many?\\n\\nthere are five of the state, and five of the soul, i said.\\n\\nwhat are they?\\n\\nthe first, i said, is that which we have been describing, and which may\\nbe said to have two names, monarchy and aristocracy, accordingly as\\nrule is exercised by one distinguished man or by many.\\n\\ntrue, he replied.\\n\\nbut i regard the two names as describing one form only; for whether the\\ngovernment is in the hands of one or many, if the governors have been\\ntrained in the manner which we have supposed, the fundamental laws of\\nthe state will be maintained.\\n\\nthat is true, he replied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book v.\\n\\n\\nsuch is the good and true city or state, and the good and true man is\\nof the same pattern; and if this is right every other is wrong; and the\\nevil is one which affects not only the ordering of the state, but also\\nthe regulation of the individual soul, and is exhibited in four forms.\\n\\nwhat are they? he said.\\n\\ni was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil forms\\nappeared to me to succeed one another, when polemarchus, who was\\nsitting a little way off, just beyond adeimantus, began to whisper to\\nhim: stretching forth his hand, he took hold of the upper part of his\\ncoat by the shoulder, and drew him towards him, leaning forward himself\\nso as to be quite close and saying something in his ear, of which i\\nonly caught the words, ‘shall we let him off, or what shall we do?’\\n\\ncertainly not, said adeimantus, raising his voice.\\n\\nwho is it, i said, whom you are refusing to let off?\\n\\nyou, he said.\\n\\ni repeated, why am i especially not to be let off?\\n\\nwhy, he said, we think that you are lazy, and mean to cheat us out of a\\nwhole chapter which is a very important part of the story; and you\\nfancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding; as if it\\nwere self-evident to everybody, that in the matter of women and\\nchildren ‘friends have all things in common.’\\n\\nand was i not right, adeimantus?\\n\\nyes, he said; but what is right in this particular case, like\\neverything else, requires to be explained; for community may be of many\\nkinds. please, therefore, to say what sort of community you mean. we\\nhave been long expecting that you would tell us something about the\\nfamily life of your citizens—how they will bring children into the\\nworld, and rear them when they have arrived, and, in general, what is\\nthe nature of this community of women and children—for we are of\\nopinion that the right or wrong management of such matters will have a\\ngreat and paramount influence on the state for good or for evil. and\\nnow, since the question is still undetermined, and you are taking in\\nhand another state, we have resolved, as you heard, not to let you go\\nuntil you give an account of all this.\\n\\nto that resolution, said glaucon, you may regard me as saying agreed.\\n\\nand without more ado, said thrasymachus, you may consider us all to be\\nequally agreed.\\n\\ni said, you know not what you are doing in thus assailing me: what an\\nargument are you raising about the state! just as i thought that i had\\nfinished, and was only too glad that i had laid this question to sleep,\\nand was reflecting how fortunate i was in your acceptance of what i\\nthen said, you ask me to begin again at the very foundation, ignorant\\nof what a hornet’s nest of words you are stirring. now i foresaw this\\ngathering trouble, and avoided it.\\n\\nfor what purpose do you conceive that we have come here, said\\nthrasymachus,—to look for gold, or to hear discourse?\\n\\nyes, but discourse should have a limit.\\n\\nyes, socrates, said glaucon, and the whole of life is the only limit\\nwhich wise men assign to the hearing of such discourses. but never mind\\nabout us; take heart yourself and answer the question in your own way:\\nwhat sort of community of women and children is this which is to\\nprevail among our guardians? and how shall we manage the period between\\nbirth and education, which seems to require the greatest care? tell us\\nhow these things will be.\\n\\nyes, my simple friend, but the answer is the reverse of easy; many more\\ndoubts arise about this than about our previous conclusions. for the\\npracticability of what is said may be doubted; and looked at in another\\npoint of view, whether the scheme, if ever so practicable, would be for\\nthe best, is also doubtful. hence i feel a reluctance to approach the\\nsubject, lest our aspiration, my dear friend, should turn out to be a\\ndream only.\\n\\nfear not, he replied, for your audience will not be hard upon you; they\\nare not sceptical or hostile.\\n\\ni said: my good friend, i suppose that you mean to encourage me by\\nthese words.\\n\\nyes, he said.\\n\\nthen let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse; the\\nencouragement which you offer would have been all very well had i\\nmyself believed that i knew what i was talking about: to declare the\\ntruth about matters of high interest which a man honours and loves\\namong wise men who love him need occasion no fear or faltering in his\\nmind; but to carry on an argument when you are yourself only a\\nhesitating enquirer, which is my condition, is a dangerous and slippery\\nthing; and the danger is not that i shall be laughed at (of which the\\nfear would be childish), but that i shall miss the truth where i have\\nmost need to be sure of my footing, and drag my friends after me in my\\nfall. and i pray nemesis not to visit upon me the words which i am\\ngoing to utter. for i do indeed believe that to be an involuntary\\nhomicide is a less crime than to be a deceiver about beauty or goodness\\nor justice in the matter of laws. and that is a risk which i would\\nrather run among enemies than among friends, and therefore you do well\\nto encourage me.\\n\\nglaucon laughed and said: well then, socrates, in case you and your\\nargument do us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand of\\nthe homicide, and shall not be held to be a deceiver; take courage then\\nand speak.\\n\\nwell, i said, the law says that when a man is acquitted he is free from\\nguilt, and what holds at law may hold in argument.\\n\\nthen why should you mind?\\n\\nwell, i replied, i suppose that i must retrace my steps and say what i\\nperhaps ought to have said before in the proper place. the part of the\\nmen has been played out, and now properly enough comes the turn of the\\nwomen. of them i will proceed to speak, and the more readily since i am\\ninvited by you.\\n\\nfor men born and educated like our citizens, the only way, in my\\nopinion, of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and use\\nof women and children is to follow the path on which we originally\\nstarted, when we said that the men were to be the guardians and\\nwatchdogs of the herd.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nlet us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be\\nsubject to similar or nearly similar regulations; then we shall see\\nwhether the result accords with our design.\\n\\nwhat do you mean?\\n\\nwhat i mean may be put into the form of a question, i said: are dogs\\ndivided into hes and shes, or do they both share equally in hunting and\\nin keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs? or do we entrust to\\nthe males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks, while we leave\\nthe females at home, under the idea that the bearing and suckling their\\npuppies is labour enough for them?\\n\\nno, he said, they share alike; the only difference between them is that\\nthe males are stronger and the females weaker.\\n\\nbut can you use different animals for the same purpose, unless they are\\nbred and fed in the same way?\\n\\nyou cannot.\\n\\nthen, if women are to have the same duties as men, they must have the\\nsame nurture and education?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthe education which was assigned to the men was music and gymnastic.\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthen women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of war,\\nwhich they must practise like the men?\\n\\nthat is the inference, i suppose.\\n\\ni should rather expect, i said, that several of our proposals, if they\\nare carried out, being unusual, may appear ridiculous.\\n\\nno doubt of it.\\n\\nyes, and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women\\nnaked in the palaestra, exercising with the men, especially when they\\nare no longer young; they certainly will not be a vision of beauty, any\\nmore than the enthusiastic old men who in spite of wrinkles and\\nugliness continue to frequent the gymnasia.\\n\\nyes, indeed, he said: according to present notions the proposal would\\nbe thought ridiculous.\\n\\nbut then, i said, as we have determined to speak our minds, we must not\\nfear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this sort of\\ninnovation; how they will talk of women’s attainments both in music and\\ngymnastic, and above all about their wearing armour and riding upon\\nhorseback!\\n\\nvery true, he replied.\\n\\nyet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law; at\\nthe same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be\\nserious. not long ago, as we shall remind them, the hellenes were of\\nthe opinion, which is still generally received among the barbarians,\\nthat the sight of a naked man was ridiculous and improper; and when\\nfirst the cretans and then the lacedaemonians introduced the custom,\\nthe wits of that day might equally have ridiculed the innovation.\\n\\nno doubt.\\n\\nbut when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was far\\nbetter than to cover them up, and the ludicrous effect to the outward\\neye vanished before the better principle which reason asserted, then\\nthe man was perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of his\\nridicule at any other sight but that of folly and vice, or seriously\\ninclines to weigh the beautiful by any other standard but that of the\\ngood.\\n\\nvery true, he replied.\\n\\nfirst, then, whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest,\\nlet us come to an understanding about the nature of woman: is she\\ncapable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men, or\\nnot at all? and is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or\\ncan not share? that will be the best way of commencing the enquiry, and\\nwill probably lead to the fairest conclusion.\\n\\nthat will be much the best way.\\n\\nshall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against\\nourselves; in this manner the adversary’s position will not be\\nundefended.\\n\\nwhy not? he said.\\n\\nthen let us put a speech into the mouths of our opponents. they will\\nsay: ‘socrates and glaucon, no adversary need convict you, for you\\nyourselves, at the first foundation of the state, admitted the\\nprinciple that everybody was to do the one work suited to his own\\nnature.’ and certainly, if i am not mistaken, such an admission was\\nmade by us. ‘and do not the natures of men and women differ very much\\nindeed?’ and we shall reply: of course they do. then we shall be asked,\\n‘whether the tasks assigned to men and to women should not be\\ndifferent, and such as are agreeable to their different natures?’\\ncertainly they should. ‘but if so, have you not fallen into a serious\\ninconsistency in saying that men and women, whose natures are so\\nentirely different, ought to perform the same actions?’—what defence\\nwill you make for us, my good sir, against any one who offers these\\nobjections?\\n\\nthat is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly; and i shall\\nand i do beg of you to draw out the case on our side.\\n\\nthese are the objections, glaucon, and there are many others of a like\\nkind, which i foresaw long ago; they made me afraid and reluctant to\\ntake in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women and\\nchildren.\\n\\nby zeus, he said, the problem to be solved is anything but easy.\\n\\nwhy yes, i said, but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth,\\nwhether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into mid ocean, he\\nhas to swim all the same.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand must not we swim and try to reach the shore: we will hope that\\narion’s dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us?\\n\\ni suppose so, he said.\\n\\nwell then, let us see if any way of escape can be found. we\\nacknowledged—did we not? that different natures ought to have different\\npursuits, and that men’s and women’s natures are different. and now\\nwhat are we saying?—that different natures ought to have the same\\npursuits,—this is the inconsistency which is charged upon us.\\n\\nprecisely.\\n\\nverily, glaucon, i said, glorious is the power of the art of\\ncontradiction!\\n\\nwhy do you say so?\\n\\nbecause i think that many a man falls into the practice against his\\nwill. when he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing, just\\nbecause he cannot define and divide, and so know that of which he is\\nspeaking; and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit\\nof contention and not of fair discussion.\\n\\nyes, he replied, such is very often the case; but what has that to do\\nwith us and our argument?\\n\\na great deal; for there is certainly a danger of our getting\\nunintentionally into a verbal opposition.\\n\\nin what way?\\n\\nwhy we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth, that\\ndifferent natures ought to have different pursuits, but we never\\nconsidered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of\\nnature, or why we distinguished them when we assigned different\\npursuits to different natures and the same to the same natures.\\n\\nwhy, no, he said, that was never considered by us.\\n\\ni said: suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the question\\nwhether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and hairy\\nmen; and if this is admitted by us, then, if bald men are cobblers, we\\nshould forbid the hairy men to be cobblers, and conversely?\\n\\nthat would be a jest, he said.\\n\\nyes, i said, a jest; and why? because we never meant when we\\nconstructed the state, that the opposition of natures should extend to\\nevery difference, but only to those differences which affected the\\npursuit in which the individual is engaged; we should have argued, for\\nexample, that a physician and one who is in mind a physician may be\\nsaid to have the same nature.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nwhereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand if, i said, the male and female sex appear to differ in their\\nfitness for any art or pursuit, we should say that such pursuit or art\\nought to be assigned to one or the other of them; but if the difference\\nconsists only in women bearing and men begetting children, this does\\nnot amount to a proof that a woman differs from a man in respect of the\\nsort of education she should receive; and we shall therefore continue\\nto maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same\\npursuits.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nnext, we shall ask our opponent how, in reference to any of the\\npursuits or arts of civic life, the nature of a woman differs from that\\nof a man?\\n\\nthat will be quite fair.\\n\\nand perhaps he, like yourself, will reply that to give a sufficient\\nanswer on the instant is not easy; but after a little reflection there\\nis no difficulty.\\n\\nyes, perhaps.\\n\\nsuppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the argument, and\\nthen we may hope to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the\\nconstitution of women which would affect them in the administration of\\nthe state.\\n\\nby all means.\\n\\nlet us say to him: come now, and we will ask you a question:—when you\\nspoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect, did you mean to\\nsay that one man will acquire a thing easily, another with difficulty;\\na little learning will lead the one to discover a great deal; whereas\\nthe other, after much study and application, no sooner learns than he\\nforgets; or again, did you mean, that the one has a body which is a\\ngood servant to his mind, while the body of the other is a hindrance to\\nhim?—would not these be the sort of differences which distinguish the\\nman gifted by nature from the one who is ungifted?\\n\\nno one will deny that.\\n\\nand can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has\\nnot all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female?\\nneed i waste time in speaking of the art of weaving, and the management\\nof pancakes and preserves, in which womankind does really appear to be\\ngreat, and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things the\\nmost absurd?\\n\\nyou are quite right, he replied, in maintaining the general inferiority\\nof the female sex: although many women are in many things superior to\\nmany men, yet on the whole what you say is true.\\n\\nand if so, my friend, i said, there is no special faculty of\\nadministration in a state which a woman has because she is a woman, or\\nwhich a man has by virtue of his sex, but the gifts of nature are alike\\ndiffused in both; all the pursuits of men are the pursuits of women\\nalso, but in all of them a woman is inferior to a man.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nthen are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on\\nwomen?\\n\\nthat will never do.\\n\\none woman has a gift of healing, another not; one is a musician, and\\nanother has no music in her nature?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises, and\\nanother is unwarlike and hates gymnastics?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand one woman is a philosopher, and another is an enemy of philosophy;\\none has spirit, and another is without spirit?\\n\\nthat is also true.\\n\\nthen one woman will have the temper of a guardian, and another not. was\\nnot the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of\\nthis sort?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nmen and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian; they\\ndiffer only in their comparative strength or weakness.\\n\\nobviously.\\n\\nand those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the\\ncompanions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom\\nthey resemble in capacity and in character?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?\\n\\nthey ought.\\n\\nthen, as we were saying before, there is nothing unnatural in assigning\\nmusic and gymnastic to the wives of the guardians—to that point we come\\nround again.\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nthe law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature, and therefore\\nnot an impossibility or mere aspiration; and the contrary practice,\\nwhich prevails at present, is in reality a violation of nature.\\n\\nthat appears to be true.\\n\\nwe had to consider, first, whether our proposals were possible, and\\nsecondly whether they were the most beneficial?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand the possibility has been acknowledged?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthe very great benefit has next to be established?\\n\\nquite so.\\n\\nyou will admit that the same education which makes a man a good\\nguardian will make a woman a good guardian; for their original nature\\nis the same?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\ni should like to ask you a question.\\n\\nwhat is it?\\n\\nwould you say that all men are equal in excellence, or is one man\\nbetter than another?\\n\\nthe latter.\\n\\nand in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the\\nguardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more\\nperfect men, or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling?\\n\\nwhat a ridiculous question!\\n\\nyou have answered me, i replied: well, and may we not further say that\\nour guardians are the best of our citizens?\\n\\nby far the best.\\n\\nand will not their wives be the best women?\\n\\nyes, by far the best.\\n\\nand can there be anything better for the interests of the state than\\nthat the men and women of a state should be as good as possible?\\n\\nthere can be nothing better.\\n\\nand this is what the arts of music and gymnastic, when present in such\\nmanner as we have described, will accomplish?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nthen we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest\\ndegree beneficial to the state?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthen let the wives of our guardians strip, for their virtue will be\\ntheir robe, and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of\\ntheir country; only in the distribution of labours the lighter are to\\nbe assigned to the women, who are the weaker natures, but in other\\nrespects their duties are to be the same. and as for the man who laughs\\nat naked women exercising their bodies from the best of motives, in his\\nlaughter he is plucking\\n\\n‘a fruit of unripe wisdom,’\\n\\nand he himself is ignorant of what he is laughing at, or what he is\\nabout;—for that is, and ever will be, the best of sayings, that the\\nuseful is the noble and the hurtful is the base.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nhere, then, is one difficulty in our law about women, which we may say\\nthat we have now escaped; the wave has not swallowed us up alive for\\nenacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their\\npursuits in common; to the utility and also to the possibility of this\\narrangement the consistency of the argument with itself bears witness.\\n\\nyes, that was a mighty wave which you have escaped.\\n\\nyes, i said, but a greater is coming; you will not think much of this\\nwhen you see the next.\\n\\ngo on; let me see.\\n\\nthe law, i said, which is the sequel of this and of all that has\\npreceded, is to the following effect,—‘that the wives of our guardians\\nare to be common, and their children are to be common, and no parent is\\nto know his own child, nor any child his parent.’\\n\\nyes, he said, that is a much greater wave than the other; and the\\npossibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more\\nquestionable.\\n\\ni do not think, i said, that there can be any dispute about the very\\ngreat utility of having wives and children in common; the possibility\\nis quite another matter, and will be very much disputed.\\n\\ni think that a good many doubts may be raised about both.\\n\\nyou imply that the two questions must be combined, i replied. now i\\nmeant that you should admit the utility; and in this way, as i thought,\\ni should escape from one of them, and then there would remain only the\\npossibility.\\n\\nbut that little attempt is detected, and therefore you will please to\\ngive a defence of both.\\n\\nwell, i said, i submit to my fate. yet grant me a little favour: let me\\nfeast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of\\nfeasting themselves when they are walking alone; for before they have\\ndiscovered any means of effecting their wishes—that is a matter which\\nnever troubles them—they would rather not tire themselves by thinking\\nabout possibilities; but assuming that what they desire is already\\ngranted to them, they proceed with their plan, and delight in detailing\\nwhat they mean to do when their wish has come true—that is a way which\\nthey have of not doing much good to a capacity which was never good for\\nmuch. now i myself am beginning to lose heart, and i should like, with\\nyour permission, to pass over the question of possibility at present.\\nassuming therefore the possibility of the proposal, i shall now proceed\\nto enquire how the rulers will carry out these arrangements, and i\\nshall demonstrate that our plan, if executed, will be of the greatest\\nbenefit to the state and to the guardians. first of all, then, if you\\nhave no objection, i will endeavour with your help to consider the\\nadvantages of the measure; and hereafter the question of possibility.\\n\\ni have no objection; proceed.\\n\\nfirst, i think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be\\nworthy of the name which they bear, there must be willingness to obey\\nin the one and the power of command in the other; the guardians must\\nthemselves obey the laws, and they must also imitate the spirit of them\\nin any details which are entrusted to their care.\\n\\nthat is right, he said.\\n\\nyou, i said, who are their legislator, having selected the men, will\\nnow select the women and give them to them;—they must be as far as\\npossible of like natures with them; and they must live in common houses\\nand meet at common meals. none of them will have anything specially his\\nor her own; they will be together, and will be brought up together, and\\nwill associate at gymnastic exercises. and so they will be drawn by a\\nnecessity of their natures to have intercourse with each\\nother—necessity is not too strong a word, i think?\\n\\nyes, he said;—necessity, not geometrical, but another sort of necessity\\nwhich lovers know, and which is far more convincing and constraining to\\nthe mass of mankind.\\n\\ntrue, i said; and this, glaucon, like all the rest, must proceed after\\nan orderly fashion; in a city of the blessed, licentiousness is an\\nunholy thing which the rulers will forbid.\\n\\nyes, he said, and it ought not to be permitted.\\n\\nthen clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the\\nhighest degree, and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred?\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nand how can marriages be made most beneficial?—that is a question which\\ni put to you, because i see in your house dogs for hunting, and of the\\nnobler sort of birds not a few. now, i beseech you, do tell me, have\\nyou ever attended to their pairing and breeding?\\n\\nin what particulars?\\n\\nwhy, in the first place, although they are all of a good sort, are not\\nsome better than others?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand do you breed from them all indifferently, or do you take care to\\nbreed from the best only?\\n\\nfrom the best.\\n\\nand do you take the oldest or the youngest, or only those of ripe age?\\n\\ni choose only those of ripe age.\\n\\nand if care was not taken in the breeding, your dogs and birds would\\ngreatly deteriorate?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand the same of horses and animals in general?\\n\\nundoubtedly.\\n\\ngood heavens! my dear friend, i said, what consummate skill will our\\nrulers need if the same principle holds of the human species!\\n\\ncertainly, the same principle holds; but why does this involve any\\nparticular skill?\\n\\nbecause, i said, our rulers will often have to practise upon the body\\ncorporate with medicines. now you know that when patients do not\\nrequire medicines, but have only to be put under a regimen, the\\ninferior sort of practitioner is deemed to be good enough; but when\\nmedicine has to be given, then the doctor should be more of a man.\\n\\nthat is quite true, he said; but to what are you alluding?\\n\\ni mean, i replied, that our rulers will find a considerable dose of\\nfalsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects: we were\\nsaying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines might be\\nof advantage.\\n\\nand we were very right.\\n\\nand this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the\\nregulations of marriages and births.\\n\\nhow so?\\n\\nwhy, i said, the principle has been already laid down that the best of\\neither sex should be united with the best as often, and the inferior\\nwith the inferior, as seldom as possible; and that they should rear the\\noffspring of the one sort of union, but not of the other, if the flock\\nis to be maintained in first-rate condition. now these goings on must\\nbe a secret which the rulers only know, or there will be a further\\ndanger of our herd, as the guardians may be termed, breaking out into\\nrebellion.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nhad we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring\\ntogether the brides and bridegrooms, and sacrifices will be offered and\\nsuitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets: the number of weddings\\nis a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers, whose\\naim will be to preserve the average of population? there are many other\\nthings which they will have to consider, such as the effects of wars\\nand diseases and any similar agencies, in order as far as this is\\npossible to prevent the state from becoming either too large or too\\nsmall.\\n\\ncertainly, he replied.\\n\\nwe shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less\\nworthy may draw on each occasion of our bringing them together, and\\nthen they will accuse their own ill-luck and not the rulers.\\n\\nto be sure, he said.\\n\\nand i think that our braver and better youth, besides their other\\nhonours and rewards, might have greater facilities of intercourse with\\nwomen given them; their bravery will be a reason, and such fathers\\nought to have as many sons as possible.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand the proper officers, whether male or female or both, for offices\\nare to be held by women as well as by men—\\n\\nyes—\\n\\nthe proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the\\npen or fold, and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who\\ndwell in a separate quarter; but the offspring of the inferior, or of\\nthe better when they chance to be deformed, will be put away in some\\nmysterious, unknown place, as they should be.\\n\\nyes, he said, that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to be\\nkept pure.\\n\\nthey will provide for their nurture, and will bring the mothers to the\\nfold when they are full of milk, taking the greatest possible care that\\nno mother recognises her own child; and other wet-nurses may be engaged\\nif more are required. care will also be taken that the process of\\nsuckling shall not be protracted too long; and the mothers will have no\\ngetting up at night or other trouble, but will hand over all this sort\\nof thing to the nurses and attendants.\\n\\nyou suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of it\\nwhen they are having children.\\n\\nwhy, said i, and so they ought. let us, however, proceed with our\\nscheme. we were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand what is the prime of life? may it not be defined as a period of\\nabout twenty years in a woman’s life, and thirty in a man’s?\\n\\nwhich years do you mean to include?\\n\\na woman, i said, at twenty years of age may begin to bear children to\\nthe state, and continue to bear them until forty; a man may begin at\\nfive-and-twenty, when he has passed the point at which the pulse of\\nlife beats quickest, and continue to beget children until he be\\nfifty-five.\\n\\ncertainly, he said, both in men and women those years are the prime of\\nphysical as well as of intellectual vigour.\\n\\nany one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the public\\nhymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing;\\nthe child of which he is the father, if it steals into life, will have\\nbeen conceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and prayers,\\nwhich at each hymeneal priestesses and priest and the whole city will\\noffer, that the new generation may be better and more useful than their\\ngood and useful parents, whereas his child will be the offspring of\\ndarkness and strange lust.\\n\\nvery true, he replied.\\n\\nand the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed\\nage who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without\\nthe sanction of the rulers; for we shall say that he is raising up a\\nbastard to the state, uncertified and unconsecrated.\\n\\nvery true, he replied.\\n\\nthis applies, however, only to those who are within the specified age:\\nafter that we allow them to range at will, except that a man may not\\nmarry his daughter or his daughter’s daughter, or his mother or his\\nmother’s mother; and women, on the other hand, are prohibited from\\nmarrying their sons or fathers, or son’s son or father’s father, and so\\non in either direction. and we grant all this, accompanying the\\npermission with strict orders to prevent any embryo which may come into\\nbeing from seeing the light; and if any force a way to the birth, the\\nparents must understand that the offspring of such an union cannot be\\nmaintained, and arrange accordingly.\\n\\nthat also, he said, is a reasonable proposition. but how will they know\\nwho are fathers and daughters, and so on?\\n\\nthey will never know. the way will be this:—dating from the day of the\\nhymeneal, the bridegroom who was then married will call all the male\\nchildren who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards his\\nsons, and the female children his daughters, and they will call him\\nfather, and he will call their children his grandchildren, and they\\nwill call the elder generation grandfathers and grandmothers. all who\\nwere begotten at the time when their fathers and mothers came together\\nwill be called their brothers and sisters, and these, as i was saying,\\nwill be forbidden to inter-marry. this, however, is not to be\\nunderstood as an absolute prohibition of the marriage of brothers and\\nsisters; if the lot favours them, and they receive the sanction of the\\npythian oracle, the law will allow them.\\n\\nquite right, he replied.\\n\\nsuch is the scheme, glaucon, according to which the guardians of our\\nstate are to have their wives and families in common. and now you would\\nhave the argument show that this community is consistent with the rest\\nof our polity, and also that nothing can be better—would you not?\\n\\nyes, certainly.\\n\\nshall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought\\nto be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the\\norganization of a state,—what is the greatest good, and what is the\\ngreatest evil, and then consider whether our previous description has\\nthe stamp of the good or of the evil?\\n\\nby all means.\\n\\ncan there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and\\nplurality where unity ought to reign? or any greater good than the bond\\nof unity?\\n\\nthere cannot.\\n\\nand there is unity where there is community of pleasures and\\npains—where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions\\nof joy and sorrow?\\n\\nno doubt.\\n\\nyes; and where there is no common but only private feeling a state is\\ndisorganized—when you have one half of the world triumphing and the\\nother plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the\\ncitizens?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nsuch differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use of\\nthe terms ‘mine’ and ‘not mine,’ ‘his’ and ‘not his.’\\n\\nexactly so.\\n\\nand is not that the best-ordered state in which the greatest number of\\npersons apply the terms ‘mine’ and ‘not mine’ in the same way to the\\nsame thing?\\n\\nquite true.\\n\\nor that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the\\nindividual—as in the body, when but a finger of one of us is hurt, the\\nwhole frame, drawn towards the soul as a centre and forming one kingdom\\nunder the ruling power therein, feels the hurt and sympathizes all\\ntogether with the part affected, and we say that the man has a pain in\\nhis finger; and the same expression is used about any other part of the\\nbody, which has a sensation of pain at suffering or of pleasure at the\\nalleviation of suffering.\\n\\nvery true, he replied; and i agree with you that in the best-ordered\\nstate there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you\\ndescribe.\\n\\nthen when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil, the\\nwhole state will make his case their own, and will either rejoice or\\nsorrow with him?\\n\\nyes, he said, that is what will happen in a well-ordered state.\\n\\nit will now be time, i said, for us to return to our state and see\\nwhether this or some other form is most in accordance with these\\nfundamental principles.\\n\\nvery good.\\n\\nour state like every other has rulers and subjects?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nall of whom will call one another citizens?\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nbut is there not another name which people give to their rulers in\\nother states?\\n\\ngenerally they call them masters, but in democratic states they simply\\ncall them rulers.\\n\\nand in our state what other name besides that of citizens do the people\\ngive the rulers?\\n\\nthey are called saviours and helpers, he replied.\\n\\nand what do the rulers call the people?\\n\\ntheir maintainers and foster-fathers.\\n\\nand what do they call them in other states?\\n\\nslaves.\\n\\nand what do the rulers call one another in other states?\\n\\nfellow-rulers.\\n\\nand what in ours?\\n\\nfellow-guardians.\\n\\ndid you ever know an example in any other state of a ruler who would\\nspeak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not\\nbeing his friend?\\n\\nyes, very often.\\n\\nand the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an\\ninterest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nbut would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as\\na stranger?\\n\\ncertainly he would not; for every one whom they meet will be regarded\\nby them either as a brother or sister, or father or mother, or son or\\ndaughter, or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected\\nwith him.\\n\\ncapital, i said; but let me ask you once more: shall they be a family\\nin name only; or shall they in all their actions be true to the name?\\nfor example, in the use of the word ‘father,’ would the care of a\\nfather be implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to\\nhim which the law commands; and is the violator of these duties to be\\nregarded as an impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to\\nreceive much good either at the hands of god or of man? are these to be\\nor not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated in their\\nears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to them to be\\ntheir parents and the rest of their kinsfolk?\\n\\nthese, he said, and none other; for what can be more ridiculous than\\nfor them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not\\nto act in the spirit of them?\\n\\nthen in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often\\nheard than in any other. as i was describing before, when any one is\\nwell or ill, the universal word will be ‘with me it is well’ or ‘it is\\nill.’\\n\\nmost true.\\n\\nand agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking, were we not saying\\nthat they will have their pleasures and pains in common?\\n\\nyes, and so they will.\\n\\nand they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will\\nalike call ‘my own,’ and having this common interest they will have a\\ncommon feeling of pleasure and pain?\\n\\nyes, far more so than in other states.\\n\\nand the reason of this, over and above the general constitution of the\\nstate, will be that the guardians will have a community of women and\\nchildren?\\n\\nthat will be the chief reason.\\n\\nand this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good, as was\\nimplied in our own comparison of a well-ordered state to the relation\\nof the body and the members, when affected by pleasure or pain?\\n\\nthat we acknowledged, and very rightly.\\n\\nthen the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly\\nthe source of the greatest good to the state?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand this agrees with the other principle which we were affirming,—that\\nthe guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other property;\\ntheir pay was to be their food, which they were to receive from the\\nother citizens, and they were to have no private expenses; for we\\nintended them to preserve their true character of guardians.\\n\\nright, he replied.\\n\\nboth the community of property and the community of families, as i am\\nsaying, tend to make them more truly guardians; they will not tear the\\ncity in pieces by differing about ‘mine’ and ‘not mine;’ each man\\ndragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his\\nown, where he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures\\nand pains; but all will be affected as far as may be by the same\\npleasures and pains because they are all of one opinion about what is\\nnear and dear to them, and therefore they all tend towards a common\\nend.\\n\\ncertainly, he replied.\\n\\nand as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their\\nown, suits and complaints will have no existence among them; they will\\nbe delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or\\nrelations are the occasion.\\n\\nof course they will.\\n\\nneither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur among\\nthem. for that equals should defend themselves against equals we shall\\nmaintain to be honourable and right; we shall make the protection of\\nthe person a matter of necessity.\\n\\nthat is good, he said.\\n\\nyes; and there is a further good in the law; viz. that if a man has a\\nquarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there, and\\nnot proceed to more dangerous lengths.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nto the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the\\nyounger.\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nnor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any\\nother violence to an elder, unless the magistrates command him; nor\\nwill he slight him in any way. for there are two guardians, shame and\\nfear, mighty to prevent him: shame, which makes men refrain from laying\\nhands on those who are to them in the relation of parents; fear, that\\nthe injured one will be succoured by the others who are his brothers,\\nsons, fathers.\\n\\nthat is true, he replied.\\n\\nthen in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace\\nwith one another?\\n\\nyes, there will be no want of peace.\\n\\nand as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will be\\nno danger of the rest of the city being divided either against them or\\nagainst one another.\\n\\nnone whatever.\\n\\ni hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they will\\nbe rid, for they are beneath notice: such, for example, as the flattery\\nof the rich by the poor, and all the pains and pangs which men\\nexperience in bringing up a family, and in finding money to buy\\nnecessaries for their household, borrowing and then repudiating,\\ngetting how they can, and giving the money into the hands of women and\\nslaves to keep—the many evils of so many kinds which people suffer in\\nthis way are mean enough and obvious enough, and not worth speaking of.\\n\\nyes, he said, a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive that.\\n\\nand from all these evils they will be delivered, and their life will be\\nblessed as the life of olympic victors and yet more blessed.\\n\\nhow so?\\n\\nthe olympic victor, i said, is deemed happy in receiving a part only of\\nthe blessedness which is secured to our citizens, who have won a more\\nglorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the public\\ncost. for the victory which they have won is the salvation of the whole\\nstate; and the crown with which they and their children are crowned is\\nthe fulness of all that life needs; they receive rewards from the hands\\nof their country while living, and after death have an honourable\\nburial.\\n\\nyes, he said, and glorious rewards they are.\\n\\ndo you remember, i said, how in the course of the previous discussion\\nsome one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians\\nunhappy—they had nothing and might have possessed all things—to whom we\\nreplied that, if an occasion offered, we might perhaps hereafter\\nconsider this question, but that, as at present advised, we would make\\nour guardians truly guardians, and that we were fashioning the state\\nwith a view to the greatest happiness, not of any particular class, but\\nof the whole?\\n\\nyes, i remember.\\n\\nand what do you say, now that the life of our protectors is made out to\\nbe far better and nobler than that of olympic victors—is the life of\\nshoemakers, or any other artisans, or of husbandmen, to be compared\\nwith it?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nat the same time i ought here to repeat what i have said elsewhere,\\nthat if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner\\nthat he will cease to be a guardian, and is not content with this safe\\nand harmonious life, which, in our judgment, is of all lives the best,\\nbut infatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into\\nhis head shall seek to appropriate the whole state to himself, then he\\nwill have to learn how wisely hesiod spoke, when he said, ‘half is more\\nthan the whole.’\\n\\nif he were to consult me, i should say to him: stay where you are, when\\nyou have the offer of such a life.\\n\\nyou agree then, i said, that men and women are to have a common way of\\nlife such as we have described—common education, common children; and\\nthey are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the\\ncity or going out to war; they are to keep watch together, and to hunt\\ntogether like dogs; and always and in all things, as far as they are\\nable, women are to share with the men? and in so doing they will do\\nwhat is best, and will not violate, but preserve the natural relation\\nof the sexes.\\n\\ni agree with you, he replied.\\n\\nthe enquiry, i said, has yet to be made, whether such a community be\\nfound possible—as among other animals, so also among men—and if\\npossible, in what way possible?\\n\\nyou have anticipated the question which i was about to suggest.\\n\\nthere is no difficulty, i said, in seeing how war will be carried on by\\nthem.\\n\\nhow?\\n\\nwhy, of course they will go on expeditions together; and will take with\\nthem any of their children who are strong enough, that, after the\\nmanner of the artisan’s child, they may look on at the work which they\\nwill have to do when they are grown up; and besides looking on they\\nwill have to help and be of use in war, and to wait upon their fathers\\nand mothers. did you never observe in the arts how the potters’ boys\\nlook on and help, long before they touch the wheel?\\n\\nyes, i have.\\n\\nand shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in\\ngiving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than\\nour guardians will be?\\n\\nthe idea is ridiculous, he said.\\n\\nthere is also the effect on the parents, with whom, as with other\\nanimals, the presence of their young ones will be the greatest\\nincentive to valour.\\n\\nthat is quite true, socrates; and yet if they are defeated, which may\\noften happen in war, how great the danger is! the children will be lost\\nas well as their parents, and the state will never recover.\\n\\ntrue, i said; but would you never allow them to run any risk?\\n\\ni am far from saying that.\\n\\nwell, but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some\\noccasion when, if they escape disaster, they will be the better for it?\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nwhether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of their\\nyouth is a very important matter, for the sake of which some risk may\\nfairly be incurred.\\n\\nyes, very important.\\n\\nthis then must be our first step,—to make our children spectators of\\nwar; but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against\\ndanger; then all will be well.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\ntheir parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war, but\\nto know, as far as human foresight can, what expeditions are safe and\\nwhat dangerous?\\n\\nthat may be assumed.\\n\\nand they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about\\nthe dangerous ones?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who\\nwill be their leaders and teachers?\\n\\nvery properly.\\n\\nstill, the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen; there is a good\\ndeal of chance about them?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthen against such chances the children must be at once furnished with\\nwings, in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape.\\n\\nwhat do you mean? he said.\\n\\ni mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth, and\\nwhen they have learnt to ride, take them on horseback to see war: the\\nhorses must not be spirited and warlike, but the most tractable and yet\\nthe swiftest that can be had. in this way they will get an excellent\\nview of what is hereafter to be their own business; and if there is\\ndanger they have only to follow their elder leaders and escape.\\n\\ni believe that you are right, he said.\\n\\nnext, as to war; what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one\\nanother and to their enemies? i should be inclined to propose that the\\nsoldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms, or is guilty of\\nany other act of cowardice, should be degraded into the rank of a\\nhusbandman or artisan. what do you think?\\n\\nby all means, i should say.\\n\\nand he who allows himself to be taken prisoner may as well be made a\\npresent of to his enemies; he is their lawful prey, and let them do\\nwhat they like with him.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nbut the hero who has distinguished himself, what shall be done to him?\\nin the first place, he shall receive honour in the army from his\\nyouthful comrades; every one of them in succession shall crown him.\\nwhat do you say?\\n\\ni approve.\\n\\nand what do you say to his receiving the right hand of fellowship?\\n\\nto that too, i agree.\\n\\nbut you will hardly agree to my next proposal.\\n\\nwhat is your proposal?\\n\\nthat he should kiss and be kissed by them.\\n\\nmost certainly, and i should be disposed to go further, and say: let no\\none whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while the\\nexpedition lasts. so that if there be a lover in the army, whether his\\nlove be youth or maiden, he may be more eager to win the prize of\\nvalour.\\n\\ncapital, i said. that the brave man is to have more wives than others\\nhas been already determined: and he is to have first choices in such\\nmatters more than others, in order that he may have as many children as\\npossible?\\n\\nagreed.\\n\\nagain, there is another manner in which, according to homer, brave\\nyouths should be honoured; for he tells how ajax, after he had\\ndistinguished himself in battle, was rewarded with long chines, which\\nseems to be a compliment appropriate to a hero in the flower of his\\nage, being not only a tribute of honour but also a very strengthening\\nthing.\\n\\nmost true, he said.\\n\\nthen in this, i said, homer shall be our teacher; and we too, at\\nsacrifices and on the like occasions, will honour the brave according\\nto the measure of their valour, whether men or women, with hymns and\\nthose other distinctions which we were mentioning; also with\\n\\n‘seats of precedence, and meats and full cups;’\\n\\nand in honouring them, we shall be at the same time training them.\\n\\nthat, he replied, is excellent.\\n\\nyes, i said; and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say, in\\nthe first place, that he is of the golden race?\\n\\nto be sure.\\n\\nnay, have we not the authority of hesiod for affirming that when they\\nare dead\\n\\n‘they are holy angels upon the earth, authors of good, averters of\\nevil, the guardians of speech-gifted men’?\\n\\nyes; and we accept his authority.\\n\\nwe must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine\\nand heroic personages, and what is to be their special distinction; and\\nwe must do as he bids?\\n\\nby all means.\\n\\nand in ages to come we will reverence them and kneel before their\\nsepulchres as at the graves of heroes. and not only they but any who\\nare deemed pre-eminently good, whether they die from age, or in any\\nother way, shall be admitted to the same honours.\\n\\nthat is very right, he said.\\n\\nnext, how shall our soldiers treat their enemies? what about this?\\n\\nin what respect do you mean?\\n\\nfirst of all, in regard to slavery? do you think it right that hellenes\\nshould enslave hellenic states, or allow others to enslave them, if\\nthey can help? should not their custom be to spare them, considering\\nthe danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under\\nthe yoke of the barbarians?\\n\\nto spare them is infinitely better.\\n\\nthen no hellene should be owned by them as a slave; that is a rule\\nwhich they will observe and advise the other hellenes to observe.\\n\\ncertainly, he said; they will in this way be united against the\\nbarbarians and will keep their hands off one another.\\n\\nnext as to the slain; ought the conquerors, i said, to take anything\\nbut their armour? does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford\\nan excuse for not facing the battle? cowards skulk about the dead,\\npretending that they are fulfilling a duty, and many an army before now\\nhas been lost from this love of plunder.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse, and also\\na degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead\\nbody when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting gear\\nbehind him,—is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at his\\nassailant, quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead?\\n\\nvery like a dog, he said.\\n\\nthen we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial?\\n\\nyes, he replied, we most certainly must.\\n\\nneither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods, least of all\\nthe arms of hellenes, if we care to maintain good feeling with other\\nhellenes; and, indeed, we have reason to fear that the offering of\\nspoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the\\ngod himself?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nagain, as to the devastation of hellenic territory or the burning of\\nhouses, what is to be the practice?\\n\\nmay i have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your opinion?\\n\\nboth should be forbidden, in my judgment; i would take the annual\\nproduce and no more. shall i tell you why?\\n\\npray do.\\n\\nwhy, you see, there is a difference in the names ‘discord’ and ‘war,’\\nand i imagine that there is also a difference in their natures; the one\\nis expressive of what is internal and domestic, the other of what is\\nexternal and foreign; and the first of the two is termed discord, and\\nonly the second, war.\\n\\nthat is a very proper distinction, he replied.\\n\\nand may i not observe with equal propriety that the hellenic race is\\nall united together by ties of blood and friendship, and alien and\\nstrange to the barbarians?\\n\\nvery good, he said.\\n\\nand therefore when hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with\\nhellenes, they will be described by us as being at war when they fight,\\nand by nature enemies, and this kind of antagonism should be called\\nwar; but when hellenes fight with one another we shall say that hellas\\nis then in a state of disorder and discord, they being by nature\\nfriends; and such enmity is to be called discord.\\n\\ni agree.\\n\\nconsider then, i said, when that which we have acknowledged to be\\ndiscord occurs, and a city is divided, if both parties destroy the\\nlands and burn the houses of one another, how wicked does the strife\\nappear! no true lover of his country would bring himself to tear in\\npieces his own nurse and mother: there might be reason in the conqueror\\ndepriving the conquered of their harvest, but still they would have the\\nidea of peace in their hearts and would not mean to go on fighting for\\never.\\n\\nyes, he said, that is a better temper than the other.\\n\\nand will not the city, which you are founding, be an hellenic city?\\n\\nit ought to be, he replied.\\n\\nthen will not the citizens be good and civilized?\\n\\nyes, very civilized.\\n\\nand will they not be lovers of hellas, and think of hellas as their own\\nland, and share in the common temples?\\n\\nmost certainly.\\n\\nand any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them as\\ndiscord only—a quarrel among friends, which is not to be called a war?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nthen they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nthey will use friendly correction, but will not enslave or destroy\\ntheir opponents; they will be correctors, not enemies?\\n\\njust so.\\n\\nand as they are hellenes themselves they will not devastate hellas, nor\\nwill they burn houses, nor ever suppose that the whole population of a\\ncity—men, women, and children—are equally their enemies, for they know\\nthat the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and that the\\nmany are their friends. and for all these reasons they will be\\nunwilling to waste their lands and rase their houses; their enmity to\\nthem will only last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled\\nthe guilty few to give satisfaction?\\n\\ni agree, he said, that our citizens should thus deal with their\\nhellenic enemies; and with barbarians as the hellenes now deal with one\\nanother.\\n\\nthen let us enact this law also for our guardians:—that they are\\nneither to devastate the lands of hellenes nor to burn their houses.\\n\\nagreed; and we may agree also in thinking that these, like all our\\nprevious enactments, are very good.\\n\\nbut still i must say, socrates, that if you are allowed to go on in\\nthis way you will entirely forget the other question which at the\\ncommencement of this discussion you thrust aside:—is such an order of\\nthings possible, and how, if at all? for i am quite ready to\\nacknowledge that the plan which you propose, if only feasible, would do\\nall sorts of good to the state. i will add, what you have omitted, that\\nyour citizens will be the bravest of warriors, and will never leave\\ntheir ranks, for they will all know one another, and each will call the\\nother father, brother, son; and if you suppose the women to join their\\narmies, whether in the same rank or in the rear, either as a terror to\\nthe enemy, or as auxiliaries in case of need, i know that they will\\nthen be absolutely invincible; and there are many domestic advantages\\nwhich might also be mentioned and which i also fully acknowledge: but,\\nas i admit all these advantages and as many more as you please, if only\\nthis state of yours were to come into existence, we need say no more\\nabout them; assuming then the existence of the state, let us now turn\\nto the question of possibility and ways and means—the rest may be left.\\n\\nif i loiter for a moment, you instantly make a raid upon me, i said,\\nand have no mercy; i have hardly escaped the first and second waves,\\nand you seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the\\nthird, which is the greatest and heaviest. when you have seen and heard\\nthe third wave, i think you will be more considerate and will\\nacknowledge that some fear and hesitation was natural respecting a\\nproposal so extraordinary as that which i have now to state and\\ninvestigate.\\n\\nthe more appeals of this sort which you make, he said, the more\\ndetermined are we that you shall tell us how such a state is possible:\\nspeak out and at once.\\n\\nlet me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the\\nsearch after justice and injustice.\\n\\ntrue, he replied; but what of that?\\n\\ni was only going to ask whether, if we have discovered them, we are to\\nrequire that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice;\\nor may we be satisfied with an approximation, and the attainment in him\\nof a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men?\\n\\nthe approximation will be enough.\\n\\nwe were enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the\\ncharacter of the perfectly just, and into injustice and the perfectly\\nunjust, that we might have an ideal. we were to look at these in order\\nthat we might judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according to\\nthe standard which they exhibited and the degree in which we resembled\\nthem, but not with any view of showing that they could exist in fact.\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nwould a painter be any the worse because, after having delineated with\\nconsummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man, he was unable to\\nshow that any such man could ever have existed?\\n\\nhe would be none the worse.\\n\\nwell, and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect state?\\n\\nto be sure.\\n\\nand is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the\\npossibility of a city being ordered in the manner described?\\n\\nsurely not, he replied.\\n\\nthat is the truth, i said. but if, at your request, i am to try and\\nshow how and under what conditions the possibility is highest, i must\\nask you, having this in view, to repeat your former admissions.\\n\\nwhat admissions?\\n\\ni want to know whether ideals are ever fully realized in language? does\\nnot the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual,\\nwhatever a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short\\nof the truth? what do you say?\\n\\ni agree.\\n\\nthen you must not insist on my proving that the actual state will in\\nevery respect coincide with the ideal: if we are only able to discover\\nhow a city may be governed nearly as we proposed, you will admit that\\nwe have discovered the possibility which you demand; and will be\\ncontented. i am sure that i should be contented—will not you?\\n\\nyes, i will.\\n\\nlet me next endeavour to show what is that fault in states which is the\\ncause of their present maladministration, and what is the least change\\nwhich will enable a state to pass into the truer form; and let the\\nchange, if possible, be of one thing only, or, if not, of two; at any\\nrate, let the changes be as few and slight as possible.\\n\\ncertainly, he replied.\\n\\ni think, i said, that there might be a reform of the state if only one\\nchange were made, which is not a slight or easy though still a possible\\none.\\n\\nwhat is it? he said.\\n\\nnow then, i said, i go to meet that which i liken to the greatest of\\nthe waves; yet shall the word be spoken, even though the wave break and\\ndrown me in laughter and dishonour; and do you mark my words.\\n\\nproceed.\\n\\ni said: ‘until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this\\nworld have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness\\nand wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who pursue either to\\nthe exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities will\\nnever have rest from their evils,—nor the human race, as i believe,—and\\nthen only will this our state have a possibility of life and behold the\\nlight of day.’ such was the thought, my dear glaucon, which i would\\nfain have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant; for to be\\nconvinced that in no other state can there be happiness private or\\npublic is indeed a hard thing.\\n\\nsocrates, what do you mean? i would have you consider that the word\\nwhich you have uttered is one at which numerous persons, and very\\nrespectable persons too, in a figure pulling off their coats all in a\\nmoment, and seizing any weapon that comes to hand, will run at you\\nmight and main, before you know where you are, intending to do heaven\\nknows what; and if you don’t prepare an answer, and put yourself in\\nmotion, you will be ‘pared by their fine wits,’ and no mistake.\\n\\nyou got me into the scrape, i said.\\n\\nand i was quite right; however, i will do all i can to get you out of\\nit; but i can only give you good-will and good advice, and, perhaps, i\\nmay be able to fit answers to your questions better than another—that\\nis all. and now, having such an auxiliary, you must do your best to\\nshow the unbelievers that you are right.\\n\\ni ought to try, i said, since you offer me such invaluable assistance.\\nand i think that, if there is to be a chance of our escaping, we must\\nexplain to them whom we mean when we say that philosophers are to rule\\nin the state; then we shall be able to defend ourselves: there will be\\ndiscovered to be some natures who ought to study philosophy and to be\\nleaders in the state; and others who are not born to be philosophers,\\nand are meant to be followers rather than leaders.\\n\\nthen now for a definition, he said.\\n\\nfollow me, i said, and i hope that i may in some way or other be able\\nto give you a satisfactory explanation.\\n\\nproceed.\\n\\ni dare say that you remember, and therefore i need not remind you, that\\na lover, if he is worthy of the name, ought to show his love, not to\\nsome one part of that which he loves, but to the whole.\\n\\ni really do not understand, and therefore beg of you to assist my\\nmemory.\\n\\nanother person, i said, might fairly reply as you do; but a man of\\npleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower of\\nyouth do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a lover’s breast,\\nand are thought by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards. is not\\nthis a way which you have with the fair: one has a snub nose, and you\\npraise his charming face; the hook-nose of another has, you say, a\\nroyal look; while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the grace of\\nregularity: the dark visage is manly, the fair are children of the\\ngods; and as to the sweet ‘honey pale,’ as they are called, what is the\\nvery name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives, and is\\nnot averse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth? in a word,\\nthere is no excuse which you will not make, and nothing which you will\\nnot say, in order not to lose a single flower that blooms in the\\nspring-time of youth.\\n\\nif you make me an authority in matters of love, for the sake of the\\nargument, i assent.\\n\\nand what do you say of lovers of wine? do you not see them doing the\\nsame? they are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine.\\n\\nvery good.\\n\\nand the same is true of ambitious men; if they cannot command an army,\\nthey are willing to command a file; and if they cannot be honoured by\\nreally great and important persons, they are glad to be honoured by\\nlesser and meaner people,—but honour of some kind they must have.\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nonce more let me ask: does he who desires any class of goods, desire\\nthe whole class or a part only?\\n\\nthe whole.\\n\\nand may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover, not of a part\\nof wisdom only, but of the whole?\\n\\nyes, of the whole.\\n\\nand he who dislikes learning, especially in youth, when he has no power\\nof judging what is good and what is not, such an one we maintain not to\\nbe a philosopher or a lover of knowledge, just as he who refuses his\\nfood is not hungry, and may be said to have a bad appetite and not a\\ngood one?\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nwhereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is\\ncurious to learn and is never satisfied, may be justly termed a\\nphilosopher? am i not right?\\n\\nglaucon said: if curiosity makes a philosopher, you will find many a\\nstrange being will have a title to the name. all the lovers of sights\\nhave a delight in learning, and must therefore be included. musical\\namateurs, too, are a folk strangely out of place among philosophers,\\nfor they are the last persons in the world who would come to anything\\nlike a philosophical discussion, if they could help, while they run\\nabout at the dionysiac festivals as if they had let out their ears to\\nhear every chorus; whether the performance is in town or country—that\\nmakes no difference—they are there. now are we to maintain that all\\nthese and any who have similar tastes, as well as the professors of\\nquite minor arts, are philosophers?\\n\\ncertainly not, i replied; they are only an imitation.\\n\\nhe said: who then are the true philosophers?\\n\\nthose, i said, who are lovers of the vision of truth.\\n\\nthat is also good, he said; but i should like to know what you mean?\\n\\nto another, i replied, i might have a difficulty in explaining; but i\\nam sure that you will admit a proposition which i am about to make.\\n\\nwhat is the proposition?\\n\\nthat since beauty is the opposite of ugliness, they are two?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand inasmuch as they are two, each of them is one?\\n\\ntrue again.\\n\\nand of just and unjust, good and evil, and of every other class, the\\nsame remark holds: taken singly, each of them is one; but from the\\nvarious combinations of them with actions and things and with one\\nanother, they are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand this is the distinction which i draw between the sight-loving,\\nart-loving, practical class and those of whom i am speaking, and who\\nare alone worthy of the name of philosophers.\\n\\nhow do you distinguish them? he said.\\n\\nthe lovers of sounds and sights, i replied, are, as i conceive, fond of\\nfine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products that\\nare made out of them, but their mind is incapable of seeing or loving\\nabsolute beauty.\\n\\ntrue, he replied.\\n\\nfew are they who are able to attain to the sight of this.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand he who, having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute\\nbeauty, or who, if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is\\nunable to follow—of such an one i ask, is he awake or in a dream only?\\nreflect: is not the dreamer, sleeping or waking, one who likens\\ndissimilar things, who puts the copy in the place of the real object?\\n\\ni should certainly say that such an one was dreaming.\\n\\nbut take the case of the other, who recognises the existence of\\nabsolute beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects\\nwhich participate in the idea, neither putting the objects in the place\\nof the idea nor the idea in the place of the objects—is he a dreamer,\\nor is he awake?\\n\\nhe is wide awake.\\n\\nand may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge,\\nand that the mind of the other, who opines only, has opinion?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nbut suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our\\nstatement, can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him,\\nwithout revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits?\\n\\nwe must certainly offer him some good advice, he replied.\\n\\ncome, then, and let us think of something to say to him. shall we begin\\nby assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have,\\nand that we are rejoiced at his having it? but we should like to ask\\nhim a question: does he who has knowledge know something or nothing?\\n(you must answer for him.)\\n\\ni answer that he knows something.\\n\\nsomething that is or is not?\\n\\nsomething that is; for how can that which is not ever be known?\\n\\nand are we assured, after looking at the matter from many points of\\nview, that absolute being is or may be absolutely known, but that the\\nutterly non-existent is utterly unknown?\\n\\nnothing can be more certain.\\n\\ngood. but if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and\\nnot to be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being and\\nthe absolute negation of being?\\n\\nyes, between them.\\n\\nand, as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to\\nnot-being, for that intermediate between being and not-being there has\\nto be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and\\nknowledge, if there be such?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\ndo we admit the existence of opinion?\\n\\nundoubtedly.\\n\\nas being the same with knowledge, or another faculty?\\n\\nanother faculty.\\n\\nthen opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter\\ncorresponding to this difference of faculties?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand knowledge is relative to being and knows being. but before i\\nproceed further i will make a division.\\n\\nwhat division?\\n\\ni will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves: they are\\npowers in us, and in all other things, by which we do as we do. sight\\nand hearing, for example, i should call faculties. have i clearly\\nexplained the class which i mean?\\n\\nyes, i quite understand.\\n\\nthen let me tell you my view about them. i do not see them, and\\ntherefore the distinctions of figure, colour, and the like, which\\nenable me to discern the differences of some things, do not apply to\\nthem. in speaking of a faculty i think only of its sphere and its\\nresult; and that which has the same sphere and the same result i call\\nthe same faculty, but that which has another sphere and another result\\ni call different. would that be your way of speaking?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand will you be so very good as to answer one more question? would you\\nsay that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?\\n\\ncertainly knowledge is a faculty, and the mightiest of all faculties.\\n\\nand is opinion also a faculty?\\n\\ncertainly, he said; for opinion is that with which we are able to form\\nan opinion.\\n\\nand yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not\\nthe same as opinion?\\n\\nwhy, yes, he said: how can any reasonable being ever identify that\\nwhich is infallible with that which errs?\\n\\nan excellent answer, proving, i said, that we are quite conscious of a\\ndistinction between them.\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthen knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct\\nspheres or subject-matters?\\n\\nthat is certain.\\n\\nbeing is the sphere or subject-matter of knowledge, and knowledge is to\\nknow the nature of being?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand opinion is to have an opinion?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand do we know what we opine? or is the subject-matter of opinion the\\nsame as the subject-matter of knowledge?\\n\\nnay, he replied, that has been already disproven; if difference in\\nfaculty implies difference in the sphere or subject-matter, and if, as\\nwe were saying, opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties, then the\\nsphere of knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same.\\n\\nthen if being is the subject-matter of knowledge, something else must\\nbe the subject-matter of opinion?\\n\\nyes, something else.\\n\\nwell then, is not-being the subject-matter of opinion? or, rather, how\\ncan there be an opinion at all about not-being? reflect: when a man has\\nan opinion, has he not an opinion about something? can he have an\\nopinion which is an opinion about nothing?\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nhe who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand not-being is not one thing but, properly speaking, nothing?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nof not-being, ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative; of\\nbeing, knowledge?\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nthen opinion is not concerned either with being or with not-being?\\n\\nnot with either.\\n\\nand can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?\\n\\nthat seems to be true.\\n\\nbut is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them, in a\\ngreater clearness than knowledge, or in a greater darkness than\\nignorance?\\n\\nin neither.\\n\\nthen i suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge,\\nbut lighter than ignorance?\\n\\nboth; and in no small degree.\\n\\nand also to be within and between them?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthen you would infer that opinion is intermediate?\\n\\nno question.\\n\\nbut were we not saying before, that if anything appeared to be of a\\nsort which is and is not at the same time, that sort of thing would\\nappear also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute\\nnot-being; and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor\\nignorance, but will be found in the interval between them?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand in that interval there has now been discovered something which we\\ncall opinion?\\n\\nthere has.\\n\\nthen what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally\\nof the nature of being and not-being, and cannot rightly be termed\\neither, pure and simple; this unknown term, when discovered, we may\\ntruly call the subject of opinion, and assign each to their proper\\nfaculty,—the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to\\nthe faculty of the mean.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthis being premised, i would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that\\nthere is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty—in whose opinion\\nthe beautiful is the manifold—he, i say, your lover of beautiful\\nsights, who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one, and the\\njust is one, or that anything is one—to him i would appeal, saying,\\nwill you be so very kind, sir, as to tell us whether, of all these\\nbeautiful things, there is one which will not be found ugly; or of the\\njust, which will not be found unjust; or of the holy, which will not\\nalso be unholy?\\n\\nno, he replied; the beautiful will in some point of view be found ugly;\\nand the same is true of the rest.\\n\\nand may not the many which are doubles be also halves?—doubles, that\\nis, of one thing, and halves of another?\\n\\nquite true.\\n\\nand things great and small, heavy and light, as they are termed, will\\nnot be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names?\\n\\ntrue; both these and the opposite names will always attach to all of\\nthem.\\n\\nand can any one of those many things which are called by particular\\nnames be said to be this rather than not to be this?\\n\\nhe replied: they are like the punning riddles which are asked at feasts\\nor the children’s puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat, with what\\nhe hit him, as they say in the puzzle, and upon what the bat was\\nsitting. the individual objects of which i am speaking are also a\\nriddle, and have a double sense: nor can you fix them in your mind,\\neither as being or not-being, or both, or neither.\\n\\nthen what will you do with them? i said. can they have a better place\\nthan between being and not-being? for they are clearly not in greater\\ndarkness or negation than not-being, or more full of light and\\nexistence than being.\\n\\nthat is quite true, he said.\\n\\nthus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the\\nmultitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are\\ntossing about in some region which is half-way between pure being and\\npure not-being?\\n\\nwe have.\\n\\nyes; and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we might\\nfind was to be described as matter of opinion, and not as matter of\\nknowledge; being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained by\\nthe intermediate faculty.\\n\\nquite true.\\n\\nthen those who see the many beautiful, and who yet neither see absolute\\nbeauty, nor can follow any guide who points the way thither; who see\\nthe many just, and not absolute justice, and the like,—such persons may\\nbe said to have opinion but not knowledge?\\n\\nthat is certain.\\n\\nbut those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to\\nknow, and not to have opinion only?\\n\\nneither can that be denied.\\n\\nthe one love and embrace the subjects of knowledge, the other those of\\nopinion? the latter are the same, as i dare say you will remember, who\\nlistened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours, but would not\\ntolerate the existence of absolute beauty.\\n\\nyes, i remember.\\n\\nshall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers of\\nopinion rather than lovers of wisdom, and will they be very angry with\\nus for thus describing them?\\n\\ni shall tell them not to be angry; no man should be angry at what is\\ntrue.\\n\\nbut those who love the truth in each thing are to be called lovers of\\nwisdom and not lovers of opinion.\\n\\nassuredly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book vi.\\n\\n\\nand thus, glaucon, after the argument has gone a weary way, the true\\nand the false philosophers have at length appeared in view.\\n\\ni do not think, he said, that the way could have been shortened.\\n\\ni suppose not, i said; and yet i believe that we might have had a\\nbetter view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined\\nto this one subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting\\nus, which he who desires to see in what respect the life of the just\\ndiffers from that of the unjust must consider.\\n\\nand what is the next question? he asked.\\n\\nsurely, i said, the one which follows next in order. inasmuch as\\nphilosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable, and\\nthose who wander in the region of the many and variable are not\\nphilosophers, i must ask you which of the two classes should be the\\nrulers of our state?\\n\\nand how can we rightly answer that question?\\n\\nwhichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions\\nof our state—let them be our guardians.\\n\\nvery good.\\n\\nneither, i said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to\\nkeep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?\\n\\nthere can be no question of that.\\n\\nand are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge of\\nthe true being of each thing, and who have in their souls no clear\\npattern, and are unable as with a painter’s eye to look at the absolute\\ntruth and to that original to repair, and having perfect vision of the\\nother world to order the laws about beauty, goodness, justice in this,\\nif not already ordered, and to guard and preserve the order of them—are\\nnot such persons, i ask, simply blind?\\n\\ntruly, he replied, they are much in that condition.\\n\\nand shall they be our guardians when there are others who, besides\\nbeing their equals in experience and falling short of them in no\\nparticular of virtue, also know the very truth of each thing?\\n\\nthere can be no reason, he said, for rejecting those who have this\\ngreatest of all great qualities; they must always have the first place\\nunless they fail in some other respect.\\n\\nsuppose then, i said, that we determine how far they can unite this and\\nthe other excellences.\\n\\nby all means.\\n\\nin the first place, as we began by observing, the nature of the\\nphilosopher has to be ascertained. we must come to an understanding\\nabout him, and, when we have done so, then, if i am not mistaken, we\\nshall also acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible, and\\nthat those in whom they are united, and those only, should be rulers in\\nthe state.\\n\\nwhat do you mean?\\n\\nlet us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a sort\\nwhich shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and\\ncorruption.\\n\\nagreed.\\n\\nand further, i said, let us agree that they are lovers of all true\\nbeing; there is no part whether greater or less, or more or less\\nhonourable, which they are willing to renounce; as we said before of\\nthe lover and the man of ambition.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand if they are to be what we were describing, is there not another\\nquality which they should also possess?\\n\\nwhat quality?\\n\\ntruthfulness: they will never intentionally receive into their mind\\nfalsehood, which is their detestation, and they will love the truth.\\n\\nyes, that may be safely affirmed of them.\\n\\n‘may be,’ my friend, i replied, is not the word; say rather ‘must be\\naffirmed:’ for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help\\nloving all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections.\\n\\nright, he said.\\n\\nand is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth?\\n\\nhow can there be?\\n\\ncan the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood?\\n\\nnever.\\n\\nthe true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as far as\\nin him lies, desire all truth?\\n\\nassuredly.\\n\\nbut then again, as we know by experience, he whose desires are strong\\nin one direction will have them weaker in others; they will be like a\\nstream which has been drawn off into another channel.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nhe whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be\\nabsorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and will hardly feel bodily\\npleasure—i mean, if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one.\\n\\nthat is most certain.\\n\\nsuch an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous; for\\nthe motives which make another man desirous of having and spending,\\nhave no place in his character.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nanother criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be\\nconsidered.\\n\\nwhat is that?\\n\\nthere should be no secret corner of illiberality; nothing can be more\\nantagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the\\nwhole of things both divine and human.\\n\\nmost true, he replied.\\n\\nthen how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of\\nall time and all existence, think much of human life?\\n\\nhe cannot.\\n\\nor can such an one account death fearful?\\n\\nno indeed.\\n\\nthen the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nor again: can he who is harmoniously constituted, who is not covetous\\nor mean, or a boaster, or a coward—can he, i say, ever be unjust or\\nhard in his dealings?\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nthen you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle, or rude\\nand unsociable; these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the\\nphilosophical nature from the unphilosophical.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthere is another point which should be remarked.\\n\\nwhat point?\\n\\nwhether he has or has not a pleasure in learning; for no one will love\\nthat which gives him pain, and in which after much toil he makes little\\nprogress.\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nand again, if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns,\\nwill he not be an empty vessel?\\n\\nthat is certain.\\n\\nlabouring in vain, he must end in hating himself and his fruitless\\noccupation? yes.\\n\\nthen a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic\\nnatures; we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand once more, the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to\\ndisproportion?\\n\\nundoubtedly.\\n\\nand do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion?\\n\\nto proportion.\\n\\nthen, besides other qualities, we must try to find a naturally\\nwell-proportioned and gracious mind, which will move spontaneously\\ntowards the true being of everything.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nwell, and do not all these qualities, which we have been enumerating,\\ngo together, and are they not, in a manner, necessary to a soul, which\\nis to have a full and perfect participation of being?\\n\\nthey are absolutely necessary, he replied.\\n\\nand must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who has\\nthe gift of a good memory, and is quick to learn,—noble, gracious, the\\nfriend of truth, justice, courage, temperance, who are his kindred?\\n\\nthe god of jealousy himself, he said, could find no fault with such a\\nstudy.\\n\\nand to men like him, i said, when perfected by years and education, and\\nto these only you will entrust the state.\\n\\nhere adeimantus interposed and said: to these statements, socrates, no\\none can offer a reply; but when you talk in this way, a strange feeling\\npasses over the minds of your hearers: they fancy that they are led\\nastray a little at each step in the argument, owing to their own want\\nof skill in asking and answering questions; these littles accumulate,\\nand at the end of the discussion they are found to have sustained a\\nmighty overthrow and all their former notions appear to be turned\\nupside down. and as unskilful players of draughts are at last shut up\\nby their more skilful adversaries and have no piece to move, so they\\ntoo find themselves shut up at last; for they have nothing to say in\\nthis new game of which words are the counters; and yet all the time\\nthey are in the right. the observation is suggested to me by what is\\nnow occurring. for any one of us might say, that although in words he\\nis not able to meet you at each step of the argument, he sees as a fact\\nthat the votaries of philosophy, when they carry on the study, not only\\nin youth as a part of education, but as the pursuit of their maturer\\nyears, most of them become strange monsters, not to say utter rogues,\\nand that those who may be considered the best of them are made useless\\nto the world by the very study which you extol.\\n\\nwell, and do you think that those who say so are wrong?\\n\\ni cannot tell, he replied; but i should like to know what is your\\nopinion.\\n\\nhear my answer; i am of opinion that they are quite right.\\n\\nthen how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease from\\nevil until philosophers rule in them, when philosophers are\\nacknowledged by us to be of no use to them?\\n\\nyou ask a question, i said, to which a reply can only be given in a\\nparable.\\n\\nyes, socrates; and that is a way of speaking to which you are not at\\nall accustomed, i suppose.\\n\\ni perceive, i said, that you are vastly amused at having plunged me\\ninto such a hopeless discussion; but now hear the parable, and then you\\nwill be still more amused at the meagreness of my imagination: for the\\nmanner in which the best men are treated in their own states is so\\ngrievous that no single thing on earth is comparable to it; and\\ntherefore, if i am to plead their cause, i must have recourse to\\nfiction, and put together a figure made up of many things, like the\\nfabulous unions of goats and stags which are found in pictures. imagine\\nthen a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is taller and\\nstronger than any of the crew, but he is a little deaf and has a\\nsimilar infirmity in sight, and his knowledge of navigation is not much\\nbetter. the sailors are quarrelling with one another about the\\nsteering—every one is of opinion that he has a right to steer, though\\nhe has never learned the art of navigation and cannot tell who taught\\nhim or when he learned, and will further assert that it cannot be\\ntaught, and they are ready to cut in pieces any one who says the\\ncontrary. they throng about the captain, begging and praying him to\\ncommit the helm to them; and if at any time they do not prevail, but\\nothers are preferred to them, they kill the others or throw them\\noverboard, and having first chained up the noble captain’s senses with\\ndrink or some narcotic drug, they mutiny and take possession of the\\nship and make free with the stores; thus, eating and drinking, they\\nproceed on their voyage in such manner as might be expected of them.\\nhim who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their plot for\\ngetting the ship out of the captain’s hands into their own whether by\\nforce or persuasion, they compliment with the name of sailor, pilot,\\nable seaman, and abuse the other sort of man, whom they call a\\ngood-for-nothing; but that the true pilot must pay attention to the\\nyear and seasons and sky and stars and winds, and whatever else belongs\\nto his art, if he intends to be really qualified for the command of a\\nship, and that he must and will be the steerer, whether other people\\nlike or not—the possibility of this union of authority with the\\nsteerer’s art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been\\nmade part of their calling. now in vessels which are in a state of\\nmutiny and by sailors who are mutineers, how will the true pilot be\\nregarded? will he not be called by them a prater, a star-gazer, a\\ngood-for-nothing?\\n\\nof course, said adeimantus.\\n\\nthen you will hardly need, i said, to hear the interpretation of the\\nfigure, which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the\\nstate; for you understand already.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nthen suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is\\nsurprised at finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities;\\nexplain it to him and try to convince him that their having honour\\nwould be far more extraordinary.\\n\\ni will.\\n\\nsay to him, that, in deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be\\nuseless to the rest of the world, he is right; but also tell him to\\nattribute their uselessness to the fault of those who will not use\\nthem, and not to themselves. the pilot should not humbly beg the\\nsailors to be commanded by him—that is not the order of nature; neither\\nare ‘the wise to go to the doors of the rich’—the ingenious author of\\nthis saying told a lie—but the truth is, that, when a man is ill,\\nwhether he be rich or poor, to the physician he must go, and he who\\nwants to be governed, to him who is able to govern. the ruler who is\\ngood for anything ought not to beg his subjects to be ruled by him;\\nalthough the present governors of mankind are of a different stamp;\\nthey may be justly compared to the mutinous sailors, and the true\\nhelmsmen to those who are called by them good-for-nothings and\\nstar-gazers.\\n\\nprecisely so, he said.\\n\\nfor these reasons, and among men like these, philosophy, the noblest\\npursuit of all, is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the\\nopposite faction; not that the greatest and most lasting injury is done\\nto her by her opponents, but by her own professing followers, the same\\nof whom you suppose the accuser to say, that the greater number of them\\nare arrant rogues, and the best are useless; in which opinion i agreed.\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand the reason why the good are useless has now been explained?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthen shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is\\nalso unavoidable, and that this is not to be laid to the charge of\\nphilosophy any more than the other?\\n\\nby all means.\\n\\nand let us ask and answer in turn, first going back to the description\\nof the gentle and noble nature. truth, as you will remember, was his\\nleader, whom he followed always and in all things; failing in this, he\\nwas an impostor, and had no part or lot in true philosophy.\\n\\nyes, that was said.\\n\\nwell, and is not this one quality, to mention no others, greatly at\\nvariance with present notions of him?\\n\\ncertainly, he said.\\n\\nand have we not a right to say in his defence, that the true lover of\\nknowledge is always striving after being—that is his nature; he will\\nnot rest in the multiplicity of individuals which is an appearance\\nonly, but will go on—the keen edge will not be blunted, nor the force\\nof his desire abate until he have attained the knowledge of the true\\nnature of every essence by a sympathetic and kindred power in the soul,\\nand by that power drawing near and mingling and becoming incorporate\\nwith very being, having begotten mind and truth, he will have knowledge\\nand will live and grow truly, and then, and not till then, will he\\ncease from his travail.\\n\\nnothing, he said, can be more just than such a description of him.\\n\\nand will the love of a lie be any part of a philosopher’s nature? will\\nhe not utterly hate a lie?\\n\\nhe will.\\n\\nand when truth is the captain, we cannot suspect any evil of the band\\nwhich he leads?\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\njustice and health of mind will be of the company, and temperance will\\nfollow after?\\n\\ntrue, he replied.\\n\\nneither is there any reason why i should again set in array the\\nphilosopher’s virtues, as you will doubtless remember that courage,\\nmagnificence, apprehension, memory, were his natural gifts. and you\\nobjected that, although no one could deny what i then said, still, if\\nyou leave words and look at facts, the persons who are thus described\\nare some of them manifestly useless, and the greater number utterly\\ndepraved; we were then led to enquire into the grounds of these\\naccusations, and have now arrived at the point of asking why are the\\nmajority bad, which question of necessity brought us back to the\\nexamination and definition of the true philosopher.\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nand we have next to consider the corruptions of the philosophic nature,\\nwhy so many are spoiled and so few escape spoiling—i am speaking of\\nthose who were said to be useless but not wicked—and, when we have done\\nwith them, we will speak of the imitators of philosophy, what manner of\\nmen are they who aspire after a profession which is above them and of\\nwhich they are unworthy, and then, by their manifold inconsistencies,\\nbring upon philosophy, and upon all philosophers, that universal\\nreprobation of which we speak.\\n\\nwhat are these corruptions? he said.\\n\\ni will see if i can explain them to you. every one will admit that a\\nnature having in perfection all the qualities which we required in a\\nphilosopher, is a rare plant which is seldom seen among men.\\n\\nrare indeed.\\n\\nand what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare\\nnatures!\\n\\nwhat causes?\\n\\nin the first place there are their own virtues, their courage,\\ntemperance, and the rest of them, every one of which praiseworthy\\nqualities (and this is a most singular circumstance) destroys and\\ndistracts from philosophy the soul which is the possessor of them.\\n\\nthat is very singular, he replied.\\n\\nthen there are all the ordinary goods of life—beauty, wealth, strength,\\nrank, and great connections in the state—you understand the sort of\\nthings—these also have a corrupting and distracting effect.\\n\\ni understand; but i should like to know more precisely what you mean\\nabout them.\\n\\ngrasp the truth as a whole, i said, and in the right way; you will then\\nhave no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks, and they will\\nno longer appear strange to you.\\n\\nand how am i to do so? he asked.\\n\\nwhy, i said, we know that all germs or seeds, whether vegetable or\\nanimal, when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or\\nsoil, in proportion to their vigour, are all the more sensitive to the\\nwant of a suitable environment, for evil is a greater enemy to what is\\ngood than to what is not.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nthere is reason in supposing that the finest natures, when under alien\\nconditions, receive more injury than the inferior, because the contrast\\nis greater.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand may we not say, adeimantus, that the most gifted minds, when they\\nare ill-educated, become pre-eminently bad? do not great crimes and the\\nspirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by\\neducation rather than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are\\nscarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil?\\n\\nthere i think that you are right.\\n\\nand our philosopher follows the same analogy—he is like a plant which,\\nhaving proper nurture, must necessarily grow and mature into all\\nvirtue, but, if sown and planted in an alien soil, becomes the most\\nnoxious of all weeds, unless he be preserved by some divine power. do\\nyou really think, as people so often say, that our youth are corrupted\\nby sophists, or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any\\ndegree worth speaking of? are not the public who say these things the\\ngreatest of all sophists? and do they not educate to perfection young\\nand old, men and women alike, and fashion them after their own hearts?\\n\\nwhen is this accomplished? he said.\\n\\nwhen they meet together, and the world sits down at an assembly, or in\\na court of law, or a theatre, or a camp, or in any other popular\\nresort, and there is a great uproar, and they praise some things which\\nare being said or done, and blame other things, equally exaggerating\\nboth, shouting and clapping their hands, and the echo of the rocks and\\nthe place in which they are assembled redoubles the sound of the praise\\nor blame—at such a time will not a young man’s heart, as they say, leap\\nwithin him? will any private training enable him to stand firm against\\nthe overwhelming flood of popular opinion? or will he be carried away\\nby the stream? will he not have the notions of good and evil which the\\npublic in general have—he will do as they do, and as they are, such\\nwill he be?\\n\\nyes, socrates; necessity will compel him.\\n\\nand yet, i said, there is a still greater necessity, which has not been\\nmentioned.\\n\\nwhat is that?\\n\\nthe gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death, which, as you\\nare aware, these new sophists and educators, who are the public, apply\\nwhen their words are powerless.\\n\\nindeed they do; and in right good earnest.\\n\\nnow what opinion of any other sophist, or of any private person, can be\\nexpected to overcome in such an unequal contest?\\n\\nnone, he replied.\\n\\nno, indeed, i said, even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly;\\nthere neither is, nor has been, nor is ever likely to be, any different\\ntype of character which has had no other training in virtue but that\\nwhich is supplied by public opinion—i speak, my friend, of human virtue\\nonly; what is more than human, as the proverb says, is not included:\\nfor i would not have you ignorant that, in the present evil state of\\ngovernments, whatever is saved and comes to good is saved by the power\\nof god, as we may truly say.\\n\\ni quite assent, he replied.\\n\\nthen let me crave your assent also to a further observation.\\n\\nwhat are you going to say?\\n\\nwhy, that all those mercenary individuals, whom the many call sophists\\nand whom they deem to be their adversaries, do, in fact, teach nothing\\nbut the opinion of the many, that is to say, the opinions of their\\nassemblies; and this is their wisdom. i might compare them to a man who\\nshould study the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who is\\nfed by him—he would learn how to approach and handle him, also at what\\ntimes and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse, and what is\\nthe meaning of his several cries, and by what sounds, when another\\nutters them, he is soothed or infuriated; and you may suppose further,\\nthat when, by continually attending upon him, he has become perfect in\\nall this, he calls his knowledge wisdom, and makes of it a system or\\nart, which he proceeds to teach, although he has no real notion of what\\nhe means by the principles or passions of which he is speaking, but\\ncalls this honourable and that dishonourable, or good or evil, or just\\nor unjust, all in accordance with the tastes and tempers of the great\\nbrute. good he pronounces to be that in which the beast delights and\\nevil to be that which he dislikes; and he can give no other account of\\nthem except that the just and noble are the necessary, having never\\nhimself seen, and having no power of explaining to others the nature of\\neither, or the difference between them, which is immense. by heaven,\\nwould not such an one be a rare educator?\\n\\nindeed he would.\\n\\nand in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of\\nthe tempers and tastes of the motley multitude, whether in painting or\\nmusic, or, finally, in politics, differ from him whom i have been\\ndescribing? for when a man consorts with the many, and exhibits to them\\nhis poem or other work of art or the service which he has done the\\nstate, making them his judges when he is not obliged, the so-called\\nnecessity of diomede will oblige him to produce whatever they praise.\\nand yet the reasons are utterly ludicrous which they give in\\nconfirmation of their own notions about the honourable and good. did\\nyou ever hear any of them which were not?\\n\\nno, nor am i likely to hear.\\n\\nyou recognise the truth of what i have been saying? then let me ask you\\nto consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe\\nin the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful,\\nor of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nthen the world cannot possibly be a philosopher?\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nand therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure of\\nthe world?\\n\\nthey must.\\n\\nand of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them?\\n\\nthat is evident.\\n\\nthen, do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved in\\nhis calling to the end? and remember what we were saying of him, that\\nhe was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence—these\\nwere admitted by us to be the true philosopher’s gifts.\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nwill not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first\\namong all, especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental\\nones?\\n\\ncertainly, he said.\\n\\nand his friends and fellow-citizens will want to use him as he gets\\nolder for their own purposes?\\n\\nno question.\\n\\nfalling at his feet, they will make requests to him and do him honour\\nand flatter him, because they want to get into their hands now, the\\npower which he will one day possess.\\n\\nthat often happens, he said.\\n\\nand what will a man such as he is be likely to do under such\\ncircumstances, especially if he be a citizen of a great city, rich and\\nnoble, and a tall proper youth? will he not be full of boundless\\naspirations, and fancy himself able to manage the affairs of hellenes\\nand of barbarians, and having got such notions into his head will he\\nnot dilate and elevate himself in the fulness of vain pomp and\\nsenseless pride?\\n\\nto be sure he will.\\n\\nnow, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to him\\nand tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding, which can\\nonly be got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse\\ncircumstances, he will be easily induced to listen?\\n\\nfar otherwise.\\n\\nand even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural\\nreasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and\\ntaken captive by philosophy, how will his friends behave when they\\nthink that they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping\\nto reap from his companionship? will they not do and say anything to\\nprevent him from yielding to his better nature and to render his\\nteacher powerless, using to this end private intrigues as well as\\npublic prosecutions?\\n\\nthere can be no doubt of it.\\n\\nand how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher?\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nthen were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which\\nmake a man a philosopher may, if he be ill-educated, divert him from\\nphilosophy, no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other\\nso-called goods of life?\\n\\nwe were quite right.\\n\\nthus, my excellent friend, is brought about all that ruin and failure\\nwhich i have been describing of the natures best adapted to the best of\\nall pursuits; they are natures which we maintain to be rare at any\\ntime; this being the class out of which come the men who are the\\nauthors of the greatest evil to states and individuals; and also of the\\ngreatest good when the tide carries them in that direction; but a small\\nman never was the doer of any great thing either to individuals or to\\nstates.\\n\\nthat is most true, he said.\\n\\nand so philosophy is left desolate, with her marriage rite incomplete:\\nfor her own have fallen away and forsaken her, and while they are\\nleading a false and unbecoming life, other unworthy persons, seeing\\nthat she has no kinsmen to be her protectors, enter in and dishonour\\nher; and fasten upon her the reproaches which, as you say, her\\nreprovers utter, who affirm of her votaries that some are good for\\nnothing, and that the greater number deserve the severest punishment.\\n\\nthat is certainly what people say.\\n\\nyes; and what else would you expect, i said, when you think of the puny\\ncreatures who, seeing this land open to them—a land well stocked with\\nfair names and showy titles—like prisoners running out of prison into a\\nsanctuary, take a leap out of their trades into philosophy; those who\\ndo so being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable crafts?\\nfor, although philosophy be in this evil case, still there remains a\\ndignity about her which is not to be found in the arts. and many are\\nthus attracted by her whose natures are imperfect and whose souls are\\nmaimed and disfigured by their meannesses, as their bodies are by their\\ntrades and crafts. is not this unavoidable?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nare they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out of\\ndurance and come into a fortune; he takes a bath and puts on a new\\ncoat, and is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his master’s\\ndaughter, who is left poor and desolate?\\n\\na most exact parallel.\\n\\nwhat will be the issue of such marriages? will they not be vile and\\nbastard?\\n\\nthere can be no question of it.\\n\\nand when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy and\\nmake an alliance with her who is in a rank above them what sort of\\nideas and opinions are likely to be generated? will they not be\\nsophisms captivating to the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or\\nworthy of or akin to true wisdom?\\n\\nno doubt, he said.\\n\\nthen, adeimantus, i said, the worthy disciples of philosophy will be\\nbut a small remnant: perchance some noble and well-educated person,\\ndetained by exile in her service, who in the absence of corrupting\\ninfluences remains devoted to her; or some lofty soul born in a mean\\ncity, the politics of which he contemns and neglects; and there may be\\na gifted few who leave the arts, which they justly despise, and come to\\nher;—or peradventure there are some who are restrained by our friend\\ntheages’ bridle; for everything in the life of theages conspired to\\ndivert him from philosophy; but ill-health kept him away from politics.\\nmy own case of the internal sign is hardly worth mentioning, for\\nrarely, if ever, has such a monitor been given to any other man. those\\nwho belong to this small class have tasted how sweet and blessed a\\npossession philosophy is, and have also seen enough of the madness of\\nthe multitude; and they know that no politician is honest, nor is there\\nany champion of justice at whose side they may fight and be saved. such\\nan one may be compared to a man who has fallen among wild beasts—he\\nwill not join in the wickedness of his fellows, but neither is he able\\nsingly to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore seeing that he\\nwould be of no use to the state or to his friends, and reflecting that\\nhe would have to throw away his life without doing any good either to\\nhimself or others, he holds his peace, and goes his own way. he is like\\none who, in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries\\nalong, retires under the shelter of a wall; and seeing the rest of\\nmankind full of wickedness, he is content, if only he can live his own\\nlife and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and\\ngood-will, with bright hopes.\\n\\nyes, he said, and he will have done a great work before he departs.\\n\\na great work—yes; but not the greatest, unless he find a state suitable\\nto him; for in a state which is suitable to him, he will have a larger\\ngrowth and be the saviour of his country, as well as of himself.\\n\\nthe causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been\\nsufficiently explained: the injustice of the charges against her has\\nbeen shown—is there anything more which you wish to say?\\n\\nnothing more on that subject, he replied; but i should like to know\\nwhich of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one\\nadapted to her.\\n\\nnot any of them, i said; and that is precisely the accusation which i\\nbring against them—not one of them is worthy of the philosophic nature,\\nand hence that nature is warped and estranged;—as the exotic seed which\\nis sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized, and is wont to be\\noverpowered and to lose itself in the new soil, even so this growth of\\nphilosophy, instead of persisting, degenerates and receives another\\ncharacter. but if philosophy ever finds in the state that perfection\\nwhich she herself is, then will be seen that she is in truth divine,\\nand that all other things, whether natures of men or institutions, are\\nbut human;—and now, i know, that you are going to ask, what that state\\nis:\\n\\nno, he said; there you are wrong, for i was going to ask another\\nquestion—whether it is the state of which we are the founders and\\ninventors, or some other?\\n\\nyes, i replied, ours in most respects; but you may remember my saying\\nbefore, that some living authority would always be required in the\\nstate having the same idea of the constitution which guided you when as\\nlegislator you were laying down the laws.\\n\\nthat was said, he replied.\\n\\nyes, but not in a satisfactory manner; you frightened us by interposing\\nobjections, which certainly showed that the discussion would be long\\nand difficult; and what still remains is the reverse of easy.\\n\\nwhat is there remaining?\\n\\nthe question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not to be\\nthe ruin of the state: all great attempts are attended with risk; ‘hard\\nis the good,’ as men say.\\n\\nstill, he said, let the point be cleared up, and the enquiry will then\\nbe complete.\\n\\ni shall not be hindered, i said, by any want of will, but, if at all,\\nby a want of power: my zeal you may see for yourselves; and please to\\nremark in what i am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly i\\ndeclare that states should pursue philosophy, not as they do now, but\\nin a different spirit.\\n\\nin what manner?\\n\\nat present, i said, the students of philosophy are quite young;\\nbeginning when they are hardly past childhood, they devote only the\\ntime saved from moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits; and even\\nthose of them who are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit,\\nwhen they come within sight of the great difficulty of the subject, i\\nmean dialectic, take themselves off. in after life when invited by some\\none else, they may, perhaps, go and hear a lecture, and about this they\\nmake much ado, for philosophy is not considered by them to be their\\nproper business: at last, when they grow old, in most cases they are\\nextinguished more truly than heracleitus’ sun, inasmuch as they never\\nlight up again. (heraclitus said that the sun was extinguished every\\nevening and relighted every morning.)\\n\\nbut what ought to be their course?\\n\\njust the opposite. in childhood and youth their study, and what\\nphilosophy they learn, should be suited to their tender years: during\\nthis period while they are growing up towards manhood, the chief and\\nspecial care should be given to their bodies that they may have them to\\nuse in the service of philosophy; as life advances and the intellect\\nbegins to mature, let them increase the gymnastics of the soul; but\\nwhen the strength of our citizens fails and is past civil and military\\nduties, then let them range at will and engage in no serious labour, as\\nwe intend them to live happily here, and to crown this life with a\\nsimilar happiness in another.\\n\\nhow truly in earnest you are, socrates! he said; i am sure of that; and\\nyet most of your hearers, if i am not mistaken, are likely to be still\\nmore earnest in their opposition to you, and will never be convinced;\\nthrasymachus least of all.\\n\\ndo not make a quarrel, i said, between thrasymachus and me, who have\\nrecently become friends, although, indeed, we were never enemies; for i\\nshall go on striving to the utmost until i either convert him and other\\nmen, or do something which may profit them against the day when they\\nlive again, and hold the like discourse in another state of existence.\\n\\nyou are speaking of a time which is not very near.\\n\\nrather, i replied, of a time which is as nothing in comparison with\\neternity. nevertheless, i do not wonder that the many refuse to\\nbelieve; for they have never seen that of which we are now speaking\\nrealized; they have seen only a conventional imitation of philosophy,\\nconsisting of words artificially brought together, not like these of\\nours having a natural unity. but a human being who in word and work is\\nperfectly moulded, as far as he can be, into the proportion and\\nlikeness of virtue—such a man ruling in a city which bears the same\\nimage, they have never yet seen, neither one nor many of them—do you\\nthink that they ever did?\\n\\nno indeed.\\n\\nno, my friend, and they have seldom, if ever, heard free and noble\\nsentiments; such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every\\nmeans in their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge,\\nwhile they look coldly on the subtleties of controversy, of which the\\nend is opinion and strife, whether they meet with them in the courts of\\nlaw or in society.\\n\\nthey are strangers, he said, to the words of which you speak.\\n\\nand this was what we foresaw, and this was the reason why truth forced\\nus to admit, not without fear and hesitation, that neither cities nor\\nstates nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small\\nclass of philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are\\nprovidentially compelled, whether they will or not, to take care of the\\nstate, and until a like necessity be laid on the state to obey them; or\\nuntil kings, or if not kings, the sons of kings or princes, are\\ndivinely inspired with a true love of true philosophy. that either or\\nboth of these alternatives are impossible, i see no reason to affirm:\\nif they were so, we might indeed be justly ridiculed as dreamers and\\nvisionaries. am i not right?\\n\\nquite right.\\n\\nif then, in the countless ages of the past, or at the present hour in\\nsome foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken, the perfected\\nphilosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a\\nsuperior power to have the charge of the state, we are ready to assert\\nto the death, that this our constitution has been, and is—yea, and will\\nbe whenever the muse of philosophy is queen. there is no impossibility\\nin all this; that there is a difficulty, we acknowledge ourselves.\\n\\nmy opinion agrees with yours, he said.\\n\\nbut do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude?\\n\\ni should imagine not, he replied.\\n\\no my friend, i said, do not attack the multitude: they will change\\ntheir minds, if, not in an aggressive spirit, but gently and with the\\nview of soothing them and removing their dislike of over-education, you\\nshow them your philosophers as they really are and describe as you were\\njust now doing their character and profession, and then mankind will\\nsee that he of whom you are speaking is not such as they supposed—if\\nthey view him in this new light, they will surely change their notion\\nof him, and answer in another strain. who can be at enmity with one who\\nloves them, who that is himself gentle and free from envy will be\\njealous of one in whom there is no jealousy? nay, let me answer for\\nyou, that in a few this harsh temper may be found but not in the\\nmajority of mankind.\\n\\ni quite agree with you, he said.\\n\\nand do you not also think, as i do, that the harsh feeling which the\\nmany entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders, who\\nrush in uninvited, and are always abusing them, and finding fault with\\nthem, who make persons instead of things the theme of their\\nconversation? and nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than\\nthis.\\n\\nit is most unbecoming.\\n\\nfor he, adeimantus, whose mind is fixed upon true being, has surely no\\ntime to look down upon the affairs of earth, or to be filled with\\nmalice and envy, contending against men; his eye is ever directed\\ntowards things fixed and immutable, which he sees neither injuring nor\\ninjured by one another, but all in order moving according to reason;\\nthese he imitates, and to these he will, as far as he can, conform\\nhimself. can a man help imitating that with which he holds reverential\\nconverse?\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nand the philosopher holding converse with the divine order, becomes\\norderly and divine, as far as the nature of man allows; but like every\\none else, he will suffer from detraction.\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nand if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning, not only himself,\\nbut human nature generally, whether in states or individuals, into that\\nwhich he beholds elsewhere, will he, think you, be an unskilful\\nartificer of justice, temperance, and every civil virtue?\\n\\nanything but unskilful.\\n\\nand if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the\\ntruth, will they be angry with philosophy? will they disbelieve us,\\nwhen we tell them that no state can be happy which is not designed by\\nartists who imitate the heavenly pattern?\\n\\nthey will not be angry if they understand, he said. but how will they\\ndraw out the plan of which you are speaking?\\n\\nthey will begin by taking the state and the manners of men, from which,\\nas from a tablet, they will rub out the picture, and leave a clean\\nsurface. this is no easy task. but whether easy or not, herein will lie\\nthe difference between them and every other legislator,—they will have\\nnothing to do either with individual or state, and will inscribe no\\nlaws, until they have either found, or themselves made, a clean\\nsurface.\\n\\nthey will be very right, he said.\\n\\nhaving effected this, they will proceed to trace an outline of the\\nconstitution?\\n\\nno doubt.\\n\\nand when they are filling in the work, as i conceive, they will often\\nturn their eyes upwards and downwards: i mean that they will first look\\nat absolute justice and beauty and temperance, and again at the human\\ncopy; and will mingle and temper the various elements of life into the\\nimage of a man; and this they will conceive according to that other\\nimage, which, when existing among men, homer calls the form and\\nlikeness of god.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nand one feature they will erase, and another they will put in, until\\nthey have made the ways of men, as far as possible, agreeable to the\\nways of god?\\n\\nindeed, he said, in no way could they make a fairer picture.\\n\\nand now, i said, are we beginning to persuade those whom you described\\nas rushing at us with might and main, that the painter of constitutions\\nis such an one as we are praising; at whom they were so very indignant\\nbecause to his hands we committed the state; and are they growing a\\nlittle calmer at what they have just heard?\\n\\nmuch calmer, if there is any sense in them.\\n\\nwhy, where can they still find any ground for objection? will they\\ndoubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being?\\n\\nthey would not be so unreasonable.\\n\\nor that his nature, being such as we have delineated, is akin to the\\nhighest good?\\n\\nneither can they doubt this.\\n\\nbut again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under\\nfavourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any\\never was? or will they prefer those whom we have rejected?\\n\\nsurely not.\\n\\nthen will they still be angry at our saying, that, until philosophers\\nbear rule, states and individuals will have no rest from evil, nor will\\nthis our imaginary state ever be realized?\\n\\ni think that they will be less angry.\\n\\nshall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle, and\\nthat they have been converted and for very shame, if for no other\\nreason, cannot refuse to come to terms?\\n\\nby all means, he said.\\n\\nthen let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected. will any\\none deny the other point, that there may be sons of kings or princes\\nwho are by nature philosophers?\\n\\nsurely no man, he said.\\n\\nand when they have come into being will any one say that they must of\\nnecessity be destroyed; that they can hardly be saved is not denied\\neven by us; but that in the whole course of ages no single one of them\\ncan escape—who will venture to affirm this?\\n\\nwho indeed!\\n\\nbut, said i, one is enough; let there be one man who has a city\\nobedient to his will, and he might bring into existence the ideal\\npolity about which the world is so incredulous.\\n\\nyes, one is enough.\\n\\nthe ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been\\ndescribing, and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand that others should approve, of what we approve, is no miracle or\\nimpossibility?\\n\\ni think not.\\n\\nbut we have sufficiently shown, in what has preceded, that all this, if\\nonly possible, is assuredly for the best.\\n\\nwe have.\\n\\nand now we say not only that our laws, if they could be enacted, would\\nbe for the best, but also that the enactment of them, though difficult,\\nis not impossible.\\n\\nvery good.\\n\\nand so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject, but\\nmore remains to be discussed;—how and by what studies and pursuits will\\nthe saviours of the constitution be created, and at what ages are they\\nto apply themselves to their several studies?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\ni omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women, and the\\nprocreation of children, and the appointment of the rulers, because i\\nknew that the perfect state would be eyed with jealousy and was\\ndifficult of attainment; but that piece of cleverness was not of much\\nservice to me, for i had to discuss them all the same. the women and\\nchildren are now disposed of, but the other question of the rulers must\\nbe investigated from the very beginning. we were saying, as you will\\nremember, that they were to be lovers of their country, tried by the\\ntest of pleasures and pains, and neither in hardships, nor in dangers,\\nnor at any other critical moment were to lose their patriotism—he was\\nto be rejected who failed, but he who always came forth pure, like gold\\ntried in the refiner’s fire, was to be made a ruler, and to receive\\nhonours and rewards in life and after death. this was the sort of thing\\nwhich was being said, and then the argument turned aside and veiled her\\nface; not liking to stir the question which has now arisen.\\n\\ni perfectly remember, he said.\\n\\nyes, my friend, i said, and i then shrank from hazarding the bold word;\\nbut now let me dare to say—that the perfect guardian must be a\\nphilosopher.\\n\\nyes, he said, let that be affirmed.\\n\\nand do not suppose that there will be many of them; for the gifts which\\nwere deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together; they are mostly\\nfound in shreds and patches.\\n\\nwhat do you mean? he said.\\n\\nyou are aware, i replied, that quick intelligence, memory, sagacity,\\ncleverness, and similar qualities, do not often grow together, and that\\npersons who possess them and are at the same time high-spirited and\\nmagnanimous are not so constituted by nature as to live orderly and in\\na peaceful and settled manner; they are driven any way by their\\nimpulses, and all solid principle goes out of them.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\non the other hand, those steadfast natures which can better be depended\\nupon, which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable, are\\nequally immovable when there is anything to be learned; they are always\\nin a torpid state, and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any\\nintellectual toil.\\n\\nquite true.\\n\\nand yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those to\\nwhom the higher education is to be imparted, and who are to share in\\nany office or command.\\n\\ncertainly, he said.\\n\\nand will they be a class which is rarely found?\\n\\nyes, indeed.\\n\\nthen the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and dangers\\nand pleasures which we mentioned before, but there is another kind of\\nprobation which we did not mention—he must be exercised also in many\\nkinds of knowledge, to see whether the soul will be able to endure the\\nhighest of all, or will faint under them, as in any other studies and\\nexercises.\\n\\nyes, he said, you are quite right in testing him. but what do you mean\\nby the highest of all knowledge?\\n\\nyou may remember, i said, that we divided the soul into three parts;\\nand distinguished the several natures of justice, temperance, courage,\\nand wisdom?\\n\\nindeed, he said, if i had forgotten, i should not deserve to hear more.\\n\\nand do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion\\nof them?\\n\\nto what do you refer?\\n\\nwe were saying, if i am not mistaken, that he who wanted to see them in\\ntheir perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way, at the\\nend of which they would appear; but that we could add on a popular\\nexposition of them on a level with the discussion which had preceded.\\nand you replied that such an exposition would be enough for you, and so\\nthe enquiry was continued in what to me seemed to be a very inaccurate\\nmanner; whether you were satisfied or not, it is for you to say.\\n\\nyes, he said, i thought and the others thought that you gave us a fair\\nmeasure of truth.\\n\\nbut, my friend, i said, a measure of such things which in any degree\\nfalls short of the whole truth is not fair measure; for nothing\\nimperfect is the measure of anything, although persons are too apt to\\nbe contented and think that they need search no further.\\n\\nnot an uncommon case when people are indolent.\\n\\nyes, i said; and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the\\nstate and of the laws.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthe guardian then, i said, must be required to take the longer circuit,\\nand toil at learning as well as at gymnastics, or he will never reach\\nthe highest knowledge of all which, as we were just now saying, is his\\nproper calling.\\n\\nwhat, he said, is there a knowledge still higher than this—higher than\\njustice and the other virtues?\\n\\nyes, i said, there is. and of the virtues too we must behold not the\\noutline merely, as at present—nothing short of the most finished\\npicture should satisfy us. when little things are elaborated with an\\ninfinity of pains, in order that they may appear in their full beauty\\nand utmost clearness, how ridiculous that we should not think the\\nhighest truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy!\\n\\na right noble thought; but do you suppose that we shall refrain from\\nasking you what is this highest knowledge?\\n\\nnay, i said, ask if you will; but i am certain that you have heard the\\nanswer many times, and now you either do not understand me or, as i\\nrather think, you are disposed to be troublesome; for you have often\\nbeen told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge, and that all\\nother things become useful and advantageous only by their use of this.\\nyou can hardly be ignorant that of this i was about to speak,\\nconcerning which, as you have often heard me say, we know so little;\\nand, without which, any other knowledge or possession of any kind will\\nprofit us nothing. do you think that the possession of all other things\\nis of any value if we do not possess the good? or the knowledge of all\\nother things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness?\\n\\nassuredly not.\\n\\nyou are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good,\\nbut the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by\\nknowledge, but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good?\\n\\nhow ridiculous!\\n\\nyes, i said, that they should begin by reproaching us with our\\nignorance of the good, and then presume our knowledge of it—for the\\ngood they define to be knowledge of the good, just as if we understood\\nthem when they use the term ‘good’—this is of course ridiculous.\\n\\nmost true, he said.\\n\\nand those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity; for\\nthey are compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as\\ngood.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthere can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this\\nquestion is involved.\\n\\nthere can be none.\\n\\nfurther, do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or to\\nseem to be what is just and honourable without the reality; but no one\\nis satisfied with the appearance of good—the reality is what they seek;\\nin the case of the good, appearance is despised by every one.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nof this then, which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of all\\nhis actions, having a presentiment that there is such an end, and yet\\nhesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the same\\nassurance of this as of other things, and therefore losing whatever\\ngood there is in other things,—of a principle such and so great as this\\nought the best men in our state, to whom everything is entrusted, to be\\nin the darkness of ignorance?\\n\\ncertainly not, he said.\\n\\ni am sure, i said, that he who does not know how the beautiful and the\\njust are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them; and i\\nsuspect that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true\\nknowledge of them.\\n\\nthat, he said, is a shrewd suspicion of yours.\\n\\nand if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our state will be\\nperfectly ordered?\\n\\nof course, he replied; but i wish that you would tell me whether you\\nconceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or\\npleasure, or different from either?\\n\\naye, i said, i knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you\\nwould not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these\\nmatters.\\n\\ntrue, socrates; but i must say that one who like you has passed a\\nlifetime in the study of philosophy should not be always repeating the\\nopinions of others, and never telling his own.\\n\\nwell, but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know?\\n\\nnot, he said, with the assurance of positive certainty; he has no right\\nto do that: but he may say what he thinks, as a matter of opinion.\\n\\nand do you not know, i said, that all mere opinions are bad, and the\\nbest of them blind? you would not deny that those who have any true\\nnotion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way\\nalong the road?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base, when\\nothers will tell you of brightness and beauty?\\n\\nstill, i must implore you, socrates, said glaucon, not to turn away\\njust as you are reaching the goal; if you will only give such an\\nexplanation of the good as you have already given of justice and\\ntemperance and the other virtues, we shall be satisfied.\\n\\nyes, my friend, and i shall be at least equally satisfied, but i cannot\\nhelp fearing that i shall fail, and that my indiscreet zeal will bring\\nridicule upon me. no, sweet sirs, let us not at present ask what is the\\nactual nature of the good, for to reach what is now in my thoughts\\nwould be an effort too great for me. but of the child of the good who\\nis likest him, i would fain speak, if i could be sure that you wished\\nto hear—otherwise, not.\\n\\nby all means, he said, tell us about the child, and you shall remain in\\nour debt for the account of the parent.\\n\\ni do indeed wish, i replied, that i could pay, and you receive, the\\naccount of the parent, and not, as now, of the offspring only; take,\\nhowever, this latter by way of interest, and at the same time have a\\ncare that i do not render a false account, although i have no intention\\nof deceiving you.\\n\\nyes, we will take all the care that we can: proceed.\\n\\nyes, i said, but i must first come to an understanding with you, and\\nremind you of what i have mentioned in the course of this discussion,\\nand at many other times.\\n\\nwhat?\\n\\nthe old story, that there is a many beautiful and a many good, and so\\nof other things which we describe and define; to all of them the term\\n‘many’ is applied.\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nand there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good, and of other\\nthings to which the term ‘many’ is applied there is an absolute; for\\nthey may be brought under a single idea, which is called the essence of\\neach.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nthe many, as we say, are seen but not known, and the ideas are known\\nbut not seen.\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nand what is the organ with which we see the visible things?\\n\\nthe sight, he said.\\n\\nand with the hearing, i said, we hear, and with the other senses\\nperceive the other objects of sense?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nbut have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex\\npiece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived?\\n\\nno, i never have, he said.\\n\\nthen reflect; has the ear or voice need of any third or additional\\nnature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be\\nheard?\\n\\nnothing of the sort.\\n\\nno, indeed, i replied; and the same is true of most, if not all, the\\nother senses—you would not say that any of them requires such an\\naddition?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nbut you see that without the addition of some other nature there is no\\nseeing or being seen?\\n\\nhow do you mean?\\n\\nsight being, as i conceive, in the eyes, and he who has eyes wanting to\\nsee; colour being also present in them, still unless there be a third\\nnature specially adapted to the purpose, the owner of the eyes will see\\nnothing and the colours will be invisible.\\n\\nof what nature are you speaking?\\n\\nof that which you term light, i replied.\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nnoble, then, is the bond which links together sight and visibility, and\\ngreat beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature; for light is\\ntheir bond, and light is no ignoble thing?\\n\\nnay, he said, the reverse of ignoble.\\n\\nand which, i said, of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord of\\nthis element? whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly\\nand the visible to appear?\\n\\nyou mean the sun, as you and all mankind say.\\n\\nmay not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows?\\n\\nhow?\\n\\nneither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun?\\n\\nno.\\n\\nyet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the sun?\\n\\nby far the most like.\\n\\nand the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is\\ndispensed from the sun?\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nthen the sun is not sight, but the author of sight who is recognised by\\nsight?\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nand this is he whom i call the child of the good, whom the good begat\\nin his own likeness, to be in the visible world, in relation to sight\\nand the things of sight, what the good is in the intellectual world in\\nrelation to mind and the things of mind:\\n\\nwill you be a little more explicit? he said.\\n\\nwhy, you know, i said, that the eyes, when a person directs them\\ntowards objects on which the light of day is no longer shining, but the\\nmoon and stars only, see dimly, and are nearly blind; they seem to have\\nno clearness of vision in them?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nbut when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines,\\nthey see clearly and there is sight in them?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand the soul is like the eye: when resting upon that on which truth and\\nbeing shine, the soul perceives and understands, and is radiant with\\nintelligence; but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and\\nperishing, then she has opinion only, and goes blinking about, and is\\nfirst of one opinion and then of another, and seems to have no\\nintelligence?\\n\\njust so.\\n\\nnow, that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing to\\nthe knower is what i would have you term the idea of good, and this you\\nwill deem to be the cause of science, and of truth in so far as the\\nlatter becomes the subject of knowledge; beautiful too, as are both\\ntruth and knowledge, you will be right in esteeming this other nature\\nas more beautiful than either; and, as in the previous instance, light\\nand sight may be truly said to be like the sun, and yet not to be the\\nsun, so in this other sphere, science and truth may be deemed to be\\nlike the good, but not the good; the good has a place of honour yet\\nhigher.\\n\\nwhat a wonder of beauty that must be, he said, which is the author of\\nscience and truth, and yet surpasses them in beauty; for you surely\\ncannot mean to say that pleasure is the good?\\n\\ngod forbid, i replied; but may i ask you to consider the image in\\nanother point of view?\\n\\nin what point of view?\\n\\nyou would say, would you not, that the sun is not only the author of\\nvisibility in all visible things, but of generation and nourishment and\\ngrowth, though he himself is not generation?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nin like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of\\nknowledge to all things known, but of their being and essence, and yet\\nthe good is not essence, but far exceeds essence in dignity and power.\\n\\nglaucon said, with a ludicrous earnestness: by the light of heaven, how\\namazing!\\n\\nyes, i said, and the exaggeration may be set down to you; for you made\\nme utter my fancies.\\n\\nand pray continue to utter them; at any rate let us hear if there is\\nanything more to be said about the similitude of the sun.\\n\\nyes, i said, there is a great deal more.\\n\\nthen omit nothing, however slight.\\n\\ni will do my best, i said; but i should think that a great deal will\\nhave to be omitted.\\n\\ni hope not, he said.\\n\\nyou have to imagine, then, that there are two ruling powers, and that\\none of them is set over the intellectual world, the other over the\\nvisible. i do not say heaven, lest you should fancy that i am playing\\nupon the name (‘ourhanoz, orhatoz’). may i suppose that you have this\\ndistinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?\\n\\ni have.\\n\\nnow take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts, and divide\\neach of them again in the same proportion, and suppose the two main\\ndivisions to answer, one to the visible and the other to the\\nintelligible, and then compare the subdivisions in respect of their\\nclearness and want of clearness, and you will find that the first\\nsection in the sphere of the visible consists of images. and by images\\ni mean, in the first place, shadows, and in the second place,\\nreflections in water and in solid, smooth and polished bodies and the\\nlike: do you understand?\\n\\nyes, i understand.\\n\\nimagine, now, the other section, of which this is only the resemblance,\\nto include the animals which we see, and everything that grows or is\\nmade.\\n\\nvery good.\\n\\nwould you not admit that both the sections of this division have\\ndifferent degrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the\\nsphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge?\\n\\nmost undoubtedly.\\n\\nnext proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the\\nintellectual is to be divided.\\n\\nin what manner?\\n\\nthus:—there are two subdivisions, in the lower of which the soul uses\\nthe figures given by the former division as images; the enquiry can\\nonly be hypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle\\ndescends to the other end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes\\nout of hypotheses, and goes up to a principle which is above\\nhypotheses, making no use of images as in the former case, but\\nproceeding only in and through the ideas themselves.\\n\\ni do not quite understand your meaning, he said.\\n\\nthen i will try again; you will understand me better when i have made\\nsome preliminary remarks. you are aware that students of geometry,\\narithmetic, and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and\\nthe figures and three kinds of angles and the like in their several\\nbranches of science; these are their hypotheses, which they and every\\nbody are supposed to know, and therefore they do not deign to give any\\naccount of them either to themselves or others; but they begin with\\nthem, and go on until they arrive at last, and in a consistent manner,\\nat their conclusion?\\n\\nyes, he said, i know.\\n\\nand do you not know also that although they make use of the visible\\nforms and reason about them, they are thinking not of these, but of the\\nideals which they resemble; not of the figures which they draw, but of\\nthe absolute square and the absolute diameter, and so on—the forms\\nwhich they draw or make, and which have shadows and reflections in\\nwater of their own, are converted by them into images, but they are\\nreally seeking to behold the things themselves, which can only be seen\\nwith the eye of the mind?\\n\\nthat is true.\\n\\nand of this kind i spoke as the intelligible, although in the search\\nafter it the soul is compelled to use hypotheses; not ascending to a\\nfirst principle, because she is unable to rise above the region of\\nhypothesis, but employing the objects of which the shadows below are\\nresemblances in their turn as images, they having in relation to the\\nshadows and reflections of them a greater distinctness, and therefore a\\nhigher value.\\n\\ni understand, he said, that you are speaking of the province of\\ngeometry and the sister arts.\\n\\nand when i speak of the other division of the intelligible, you will\\nunderstand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason\\nherself attains by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not as\\nfirst principles, but only as hypotheses—that is to say, as steps and\\npoints of departure into a world which is above hypotheses, in order\\nthat she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole; and\\nclinging to this and then to that which depends on this, by successive\\nsteps she descends again without the aid of any sensible object, from\\nideas, through ideas, and in ideas she ends.\\n\\ni understand you, he replied; not perfectly, for you seem to me to be\\ndescribing a task which is really tremendous; but, at any rate, i\\nunderstand you to say that knowledge and being, which the science of\\ndialectic contemplates, are clearer than the notions of the arts, as\\nthey are termed, which proceed from hypotheses only: these are also\\ncontemplated by the understanding, and not by the senses: yet, because\\nthey start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle, those who\\ncontemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher reason upon\\nthem, although when a first principle is added to them they are\\ncognizable by the higher reason. and the habit which is concerned with\\ngeometry and the cognate sciences i suppose that you would term\\nunderstanding and not reason, as being intermediate between opinion and\\nreason.\\n\\nyou have quite conceived my meaning, i said; and now, corresponding to\\nthese four divisions, let there be four faculties in the soul—reason\\nanswering to the highest, understanding to the second, faith (or\\nconviction) to the third, and perception of shadows to the last—and let\\nthere be a scale of them, and let us suppose that the several faculties\\nhave clearness in the same degree that their objects have truth.\\n\\ni understand, he replied, and give my assent, and accept your\\narrangement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book vii.\\n\\n\\nand now, i said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is\\nenlightened or unenlightened:—behold! human beings living in a\\nunderground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching\\nall along the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have\\ntheir legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see\\nbefore them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their\\nheads. above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, and\\nbetween the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will\\nsee, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which\\nmarionette players have in front of them, over which they show the\\npuppets.\\n\\ni see.\\n\\nand do you see, i said, men passing along the wall carrying all sorts\\nof vessels, and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone\\nand various materials, which appear over the wall? some of them are\\ntalking, others silent.\\n\\nyou have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners.\\n\\nlike ourselves, i replied; and they see only their own shadows, or the\\nshadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of\\nthe cave?\\n\\ntrue, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they were\\nnever allowed to move their heads?\\n\\nand of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would\\nonly see the shadows?\\n\\nyes, he said.\\n\\nand if they were able to converse with one another, would they not\\nsuppose that they were naming what was actually before them?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the\\nother side, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by\\nspoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow?\\n\\nno question, he replied.\\n\\nto them, i said, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows\\nof the images.\\n\\nthat is certain.\\n\\nand now look again, and see what will naturally follow if the prisoners\\nare released and disabused of their error. at first, when any of them\\nis liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round\\nand walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the\\nglare will distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities of\\nwhich in his former state he had seen the shadows; and then conceive\\nsome one saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but\\nthat now, when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned\\ntowards more real existence, he has a clearer vision,—what will be his\\nreply? and you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to\\nthe objects as they pass and requiring him to name them,—will he not be\\nperplexed? will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are\\ntruer than the objects which are now shown to him?\\n\\nfar truer.\\n\\nand if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have\\na pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the\\nobjects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in\\nreality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nand suppose once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and\\nrugged ascent, and held fast until he is forced into the presence of\\nthe sun himself, is he not likely to be pained and irritated? when he\\napproaches the light his eyes will be dazzled, and he will not be able\\nto see anything at all of what are now called realities.\\n\\nnot all in a moment, he said.\\n\\nhe will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world. and\\nfirst he will see the shadows best, next the reflections of men and\\nother objects in the water, and then the objects themselves; then he\\nwill gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled\\nheaven; and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the\\nsun or the light of the sun by day?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nlast of all he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections of\\nhim in the water, but he will see him in his own proper place, and not\\nin another; and he will contemplate him as he is.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nhe will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and\\nthe years, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world, and\\nin a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have\\nbeen accustomed to behold?\\n\\nclearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then reason about him.\\n\\nand when he remembered his old habitation, and the wisdom of the den\\nand his fellow-prisoners, do you not suppose that he would felicitate\\nhimself on the change, and pity them?\\n\\ncertainly, he would.\\n\\nand if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves on\\nthose who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark\\nwhich of them went before, and which followed after, and which were\\ntogether; and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to\\nthe future, do you think that he would care for such honours and\\nglories, or envy the possessors of them? would he not say with homer,\\n\\n‘better to be the poor servant of a poor master,’\\n\\nand to endure anything, rather than think as they do and live after\\ntheir manner?\\n\\nyes, he said, i think that he would rather suffer anything than\\nentertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner.\\n\\nimagine once more, i said, such an one coming suddenly out of the sun\\nto be replaced in his old situation; would he not be certain to have\\nhis eyes full of darkness?\\n\\nto be sure, he said.\\n\\nand if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the\\nshadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den, while\\nhis sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and\\nthe time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might\\nbe very considerable), would he not be ridiculous? men would say of him\\nthat up he went and down he came without his eyes; and that it was\\nbetter not even to think of ascending; and if any one tried to loose\\nanother and lead him up to the light, let them only catch the offender,\\nand they would put him to death.\\n\\nno question, he said.\\n\\nthis entire allegory, i said, you may now append, dear glaucon, to the\\nprevious argument; the prison-house is the world of sight, the light of\\nthe fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret\\nthe journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual\\nworld according to my poor belief, which, at your desire, i have\\nexpressed—whether rightly or wrongly god knows. but, whether true or\\nfalse, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good\\nappears last of all, and is seen only with an effort; and, when seen,\\nis also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and\\nright, parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world,\\nand the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual; and\\nthat this is the power upon which he who would act rationally either in\\npublic or private life must have his eye fixed.\\n\\ni agree, he said, as far as i am able to understand you.\\n\\nmoreover, i said, you must not wonder that those who attain to this\\nbeatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs; for their\\nsouls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to\\ndwell; which desire of theirs is very natural, if our allegory may be\\ntrusted.\\n\\nyes, very natural.\\n\\nand is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine\\ncontemplations to the evil state of man, misbehaving himself in a\\nridiculous manner; if, while his eyes are blinking and before he has\\nbecome accustomed to the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight\\nin courts of law, or in other places, about the images or the shadows\\nof images of justice, and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of\\nthose who have never yet seen absolute justice?\\n\\nanything but surprising, he replied.\\n\\nany one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of\\nthe eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from\\ncoming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of\\nthe mind’s eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who\\nremembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak,\\nwill not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of\\nman has come out of the brighter life, and is unable to see because\\nunaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness to the day is\\ndazzled by excess of light. and he will count the one happy in his\\ncondition and state of being, and he will pity the other; or, if he\\nhave a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light,\\nthere will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him\\nwho returns from above out of the light into the den.\\n\\nthat, he said, is a very just distinction.\\n\\nbut then, if i am right, certain professors of education must be wrong\\nwhen they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not\\nthere before, like sight into blind eyes.\\n\\nthey undoubtedly say this, he replied.\\n\\nwhereas, our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning\\nexists in the soul already; and that just as the eye was unable to turn\\nfrom darkness to light without the whole body, so too the instrument of\\nknowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the\\nworld of becoming into that of being, and learn by degrees to endure\\nthe sight of being, and of the brightest and best of being, or in other\\nwords, of the good.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the\\neasiest and quickest manner; not implanting the faculty of sight, for\\nthat exists already, but has been turned in the wrong direction, and is\\nlooking away from the truth?\\n\\nyes, he said, such an art may be presumed.\\n\\nand whereas the other so-called virtues of the soul seem to be akin to\\nbodily qualities, for even when they are not originally innate they can\\nbe implanted later by habit and exercise, the virtue of wisdom more\\nthan anything else contains a divine element which always remains, and\\nby this conversion is rendered useful and profitable; or, on the other\\nhand, hurtful and useless. did you never observe the narrow\\nintelligence flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue—how eager he\\nis, how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end; he is the\\nreverse of blind, but his keen eye-sight is forced into the service of\\nevil, and he is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness?\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nbut what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days\\nof their youth; and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures,\\nsuch as eating and drinking, which, like leaden weights, were attached\\nto them at their birth, and which drag them down and turn the vision of\\ntheir souls upon the things that are below—if, i say, they had been\\nreleased from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction,\\nthe very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as\\nthey see what their eyes are turned to now.\\n\\nvery likely.\\n\\nyes, i said; and there is another thing which is likely, or rather a\\nnecessary inference from what has preceded, that neither the uneducated\\nand uninformed of the truth, nor yet those who never make an end of\\ntheir education, will be able ministers of state; not the former,\\nbecause they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their\\nactions, private as well as public; nor the latter, because they will\\nnot act at all except upon compulsion, fancying that they are already\\ndwelling apart in the islands of the blest.\\n\\nvery true, he replied.\\n\\nthen, i said, the business of us who are the founders of the state will\\nbe to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have\\nalready shown to be the greatest of all—they must continue to ascend\\nuntil they arrive at the good; but when they have ascended and seen\\nenough we must not allow them to do as they do now.\\n\\nwhat do you mean?\\n\\ni mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be\\nallowed; they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the\\nden, and partake of their labours and honours, whether they are worth\\nhaving or not.\\n\\nbut is not this unjust? he said; ought we to give them a worse life,\\nwhen they might have a better?\\n\\nyou have again forgotten, my friend, i said, the intention of the\\nlegislator, who did not aim at making any one class in the state happy\\nabove the rest; the happiness was to be in the whole state, and he held\\nthe citizens together by persuasion and necessity, making them\\nbenefactors of the state, and therefore benefactors of one another; to\\nthis end he created them, not to please themselves, but to be his\\ninstruments in binding up the state.\\n\\ntrue, he said, i had forgotten.\\n\\nobserve, glaucon, that there will be no injustice in compelling our\\nphilosophers to have a care and providence of others; we shall explain\\nto them that in other states, men of their class are not obliged to\\nshare in the toils of politics: and this is reasonable, for they grow\\nup at their own sweet will, and the government would rather not have\\nthem. being self-taught, they cannot be expected to show any gratitude\\nfor a culture which they have never received. but we have brought you\\ninto the world to be rulers of the hive, kings of yourselves and of the\\nother citizens, and have educated you far better and more perfectly\\nthan they have been educated, and you are better able to share in the\\ndouble duty. wherefore each of you, when his turn comes, must go down\\nto the general underground abode, and get the habit of seeing in the\\ndark. when you have acquired the habit, you will see ten thousand times\\nbetter than the inhabitants of the den, and you will know what the\\nseveral images are, and what they represent, because you have seen the\\nbeautiful and just and good in their truth. and thus our state, which\\nis also yours, will be a reality, and not a dream only, and will be\\nadministered in a spirit unlike that of other states, in which men\\nfight with one another about shadows only and are distracted in the\\nstruggle for power, which in their eyes is a great good. whereas the\\ntruth is that the state in which the rulers are most reluctant to\\ngovern is always the best and most quietly governed, and the state in\\nwhich they are most eager, the worst.\\n\\nquite true, he replied.\\n\\nand will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their turn at\\nthe toils of state, when they are allowed to spend the greater part of\\ntheir time with one another in the heavenly light?\\n\\nimpossible, he answered; for they are just men, and the commands which\\nwe impose upon them are just; there can be no doubt that every one of\\nthem will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the fashion\\nof our present rulers of state.\\n\\nyes, my friend, i said; and there lies the point. you must contrive for\\nyour future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler, and\\nthen you may have a well-ordered state; for only in the state which\\noffers this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver and gold,\\nbut in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of life. whereas\\nif they go to the administration of public affairs, poor and hungering\\nafter their own private advantage, thinking that hence they are to\\nsnatch the chief good, order there can never be; for they will be\\nfighting about office, and the civil and domestic broils which thus\\narise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole state.\\n\\nmost true, he replied.\\n\\nand the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition\\nis that of true philosophy. do you know of any other?\\n\\nindeed, i do not, he said.\\n\\nand those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task? for, if they\\nare, there will be rival lovers, and they will fight.\\n\\nno question.\\n\\nwho then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians? surely they\\nwill be the men who are wisest about affairs of state, and by whom the\\nstate is best administered, and who at the same time have other honours\\nand another and a better life than that of politics?\\n\\nthey are the men, and i will choose them, he replied.\\n\\nand now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced,\\nand how they are to be brought from darkness to light,—as some are said\\nto have ascended from the world below to the gods?\\n\\nby all means, he replied.\\n\\nthe process, i said, is not the turning over of an oyster-shell (in\\nallusion to a game in which two parties fled or pursued according as an\\noyster-shell which was thrown into the air fell with the dark or light\\nside uppermost.), but the turning round of a soul passing from a day\\nwhich is little better than night to the true day of being, that is,\\nthe ascent from below, which we affirm to be true philosophy?\\n\\nquite so.\\n\\nand should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of\\neffecting such a change?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nwhat sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming\\nto being? and another consideration has just occurred to me: you will\\nremember that our young men are to be warrior athletes?\\n\\nyes, that was said.\\n\\nthen this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?\\n\\nwhat quality?\\n\\nusefulness in war.\\n\\nyes, if possible.\\n\\nthere were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?\\n\\njust so.\\n\\nthere was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the\\nbody, and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and\\ncorruption?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthen that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?\\n\\nno.\\n\\nbut what do you say of music, which also entered to a certain extent\\ninto our former scheme?\\n\\nmusic, he said, as you will remember, was the counterpart of gymnastic,\\nand trained the guardians by the influences of habit, by harmony making\\nthem harmonious, by rhythm rhythmical, but not giving them science; and\\nthe words, whether fabulous or possibly true, had kindred elements of\\nrhythm and harmony in them. but in music there was nothing which tended\\nto that good which you are now seeking.\\n\\nyou are most accurate, i said, in your recollection; in music there\\ncertainly was nothing of the kind. but what branch of knowledge is\\nthere, my dear glaucon, which is of the desired nature; since all the\\nuseful arts were reckoned mean by us?\\n\\nundoubtedly; and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded, and the arts\\nare also excluded, what remains?\\n\\nwell, i said, there may be nothing left of our special subjects; and\\nthen we shall have to take something which is not special, but of\\nuniversal application.\\n\\nwhat may that be?\\n\\na something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in\\ncommon, and which every one first has to learn among the elements of\\neducation.\\n\\nwhat is that?\\n\\nthe little matter of distinguishing one, two, and three—in a word,\\nnumber and calculation:—do not all arts and sciences necessarily\\npartake of them?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthen the art of war partakes of them?\\n\\nto be sure.\\n\\nthen palamedes, whenever he appears in tragedy, proves agamemnon\\nridiculously unfit to be a general. did you never remark how he\\ndeclares that he had invented number, and had numbered the ships and\\nset in array the ranks of the army at troy; which implies that they had\\nnever been numbered before, and agamemnon must be supposed literally to\\nhave been incapable of counting his own feet—how could he if he was\\nignorant of number? and if that is true, what sort of general must he\\nhave been?\\n\\ni should say a very strange one, if this was as you say.\\n\\ncan we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic?\\n\\ncertainly he should, if he is to have the smallest understanding of\\nmilitary tactics, or indeed, i should rather say, if he is to be a man\\nat all.\\n\\ni should like to know whether you have the same notion which i have of\\nthis study?\\n\\nwhat is your notion?\\n\\nit appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking, and\\nwhich leads naturally to reflection, but never to have been rightly\\nused; for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being.\\n\\nwill you explain your meaning? he said.\\n\\ni will try, i said; and i wish you would share the enquiry with me, and\\nsay ‘yes’ or ‘no’ when i attempt to distinguish in my own mind what\\nbranches of knowledge have this attracting power, in order that we may\\nhave clearer proof that arithmetic is, as i suspect, one of them.\\n\\nexplain, he said.\\n\\ni mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds; some of them do\\nnot invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them;\\nwhile in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that\\nfurther enquiry is imperatively demanded.\\n\\nyou are clearly referring, he said, to the manner in which the senses\\nare imposed upon by distance, and by painting in light and shade.\\n\\nno, i said, that is not at all my meaning.\\n\\nthen what is your meaning?\\n\\nwhen speaking of uninviting objects, i mean those which do not pass\\nfrom one sensation to the opposite; inviting objects are those which\\ndo; in this latter case the sense coming upon the object, whether at a\\ndistance or near, gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular\\nthan of its opposite. an illustration will make my meaning\\nclearer:—here are three fingers—a little finger, a second finger, and a\\nmiddle finger.\\n\\nvery good.\\n\\nyou may suppose that they are seen quite close: and here comes the\\npoint.\\n\\nwhat is it?\\n\\neach of them equally appears a finger, whether seen in the middle or at\\nthe extremity, whether white or black, or thick or thin—it makes no\\ndifference; a finger is a finger all the same. in these cases a man is\\nnot compelled to ask of thought the question what is a finger? for the\\nsight never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand therefore, i said, as we might expect, there is nothing here which\\ninvites or excites intelligence.\\n\\nthere is not, he said.\\n\\nbut is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers?\\ncan sight adequately perceive them? and is no difference made by the\\ncircumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at\\nthe extremity? and in like manner does the touch adequately perceive\\nthe qualities of thickness or thinness, of softness or hardness? and so\\nof the other senses; do they give perfect intimations of such matters?\\nis not their mode of operation on this wise—the sense which is\\nconcerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also\\nwith the quality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the\\nsame thing is felt to be both hard and soft?\\n\\nyou are quite right, he said.\\n\\nand must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense\\ngives of a hard which is also soft? what, again, is the meaning of\\nlight and heavy, if that which is light is also heavy, and that which\\nis heavy, light?\\n\\nyes, he said, these intimations which the soul receives are very\\ncurious and require to be explained.\\n\\nyes, i said, and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons to\\nher aid calculation and intelligence, that she may see whether the\\nseveral objects announced to her are one or two.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand if they turn out to be two, is not each of them one and different?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the two as in a\\nstate of division, for if there were undivided they could only be\\nconceived of as one?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthe eye certainly did see both small and great, but only in a confused\\nmanner; they were not distinguished.\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nwhereas the thinking mind, intending to light up the chaos, was\\ncompelled to reverse the process, and look at small and great as\\nseparate and not confused.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nwas not this the beginning of the enquiry ‘what is great?’ and ‘what is\\nsmall?’\\n\\nexactly so.\\n\\nand thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible.\\n\\nmost true.\\n\\nthis was what i meant when i spoke of impressions which invited the\\nintellect, or the reverse—those which are simultaneous with opposite\\nimpressions, invite thought; those which are not simultaneous do not.\\n\\ni understand, he said, and agree with you.\\n\\nand to which class do unity and number belong?\\n\\ni do not know, he replied.\\n\\nthink a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply the\\nanswer; for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the sight\\nor by any other sense, then, as we were saying in the case of the\\nfinger, there would be nothing to attract towards being; but when there\\nis some contradiction always present, and one is the reverse of one and\\ninvolves the conception of plurality, then thought begins to be aroused\\nwithin us, and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision\\nasks ‘what is absolute unity?’ this is the way in which the study of\\nthe one has a power of drawing and converting the mind to the\\ncontemplation of true being.\\n\\nand surely, he said, this occurs notably in the case of one; for we see\\nthe same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude?\\n\\nyes, i said; and this being true of one must be equally true of all\\nnumber?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand they appear to lead the mind towards truth?\\n\\nyes, in a very remarkable manner.\\n\\nthen this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking, having a\\ndouble use, military and philosophical; for the man of war must learn\\nthe art of number or he will not know how to array his troops, and the\\nphilosopher also, because he has to rise out of the sea of change and\\nlay hold of true being, and therefore he must be an arithmetician.\\n\\nthat is true.\\n\\nand our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nthen this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe;\\nand we must endeavour to persuade those who are to be the principal men\\nof our state to go and learn arithmetic, not as amateurs, but they must\\ncarry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind\\nonly; nor again, like merchants or retail-traders, with a view to\\nbuying or selling, but for the sake of their military use, and of the\\nsoul herself; and because this will be the easiest way for her to pass\\nfrom becoming to truth and being.\\n\\nthat is excellent, he said.\\n\\nyes, i said, and now having spoken of it, i must add how charming the\\nscience is! and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end, if\\npursued in the spirit of a philosopher, and not of a shopkeeper!\\n\\nhow do you mean?\\n\\ni mean, as i was saying, that arithmetic has a very great and elevating\\neffect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and\\nrebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into\\nthe argument. you know how steadily the masters of the art repel and\\nridicule any one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is\\ncalculating, and if you divide, they multiply (meaning either (1) that\\nthey integrate the number because they deny the possibility of\\nfractions; or (2) that division is regarded by them as a process of\\nmultiplication, for the fractions of one continue to be units.), taking\\ncare that one shall continue one and not become lost in fractions.\\n\\nthat is very true.\\n\\nnow, suppose a person were to say to them: o my friends, what are these\\nwonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as you say,\\nthere is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal,\\ninvariable, indivisible,—what would they answer?\\n\\nthey would answer, as i should conceive, that they were speaking of\\nthose numbers which can only be realized in thought.\\n\\nthen you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary,\\nnecessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in\\nthe attainment of pure truth?\\n\\nyes; that is a marked characteristic of it.\\n\\nand have you further observed, that those who have a natural talent for\\ncalculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge; and\\neven the dull, if they have had an arithmetical training, although they\\nmay derive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker than\\nthey would otherwise have been.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nand indeed, you will not easily find a more difficult study, and not\\nmany as difficult.\\n\\nyou will not.\\n\\nand, for all these reasons, arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which\\nthe best natures should be trained, and which must not be given up.\\n\\ni agree.\\n\\nlet this then be made one of our subjects of education. and next, shall\\nwe enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us?\\n\\nyou mean geometry?\\n\\nexactly so.\\n\\nclearly, he said, we are concerned with that part of geometry which\\nrelates to war; for in pitching a camp, or taking up a position, or\\nclosing or extending the lines of an army, or any other military\\nmanoeuvre, whether in actual battle or on a march, it will make all the\\ndifference whether a general is or is not a geometrician.\\n\\nyes, i said, but for that purpose a very little of either geometry or\\ncalculation will be enough; the question relates rather to the greater\\nand more advanced part of geometry—whether that tends in any degree to\\nmake more easy the vision of the idea of good; and thither, as i was\\nsaying, all things tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze towards\\nthat place, where is the full perfection of being, which she ought, by\\nall means, to behold.\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nthen if geometry compels us to view being, it concerns us; if becoming\\nonly, it does not concern us?\\n\\nyes, that is what we assert.\\n\\nyet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not deny\\nthat such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the\\nordinary language of geometricians.\\n\\nhow so?\\n\\nthey have in view practice only, and are always speaking, in a narrow\\nand ridiculous manner, of squaring and extending and applying and the\\nlike—they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life;\\nwhereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science.\\n\\ncertainly, he said.\\n\\nthen must not a further admission be made?\\n\\nwhat admission?\\n\\nthat the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal,\\nand not of aught perishing and transient.\\n\\nthat, he replied, may be readily allowed, and is true.\\n\\nthen, my noble friend, geometry will draw the soul towards truth, and\\ncreate the spirit of philosophy, and raise up that which is now\\nunhappily allowed to fall down.\\n\\nnothing will be more likely to have such an effect.\\n\\nthen nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants\\nof your fair city should by all means learn geometry. moreover the\\nscience has indirect effects, which are not small.\\n\\nof what kind? he said.\\n\\nthere are the military advantages of which you spoke, i said; and in\\nall departments of knowledge, as experience proves, any one who has\\nstudied geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has\\nnot.\\n\\nyes indeed, he said, there is an infinite difference between them.\\n\\nthen shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our\\nyouth will study?\\n\\nlet us do so, he replied.\\n\\nand suppose we make astronomy the third—what do you say?\\n\\ni am strongly inclined to it, he said; the observation of the seasons\\nand of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the\\nfarmer or sailor.\\n\\ni am amused, i said, at your fear of the world, which makes you guard\\nagainst the appearance of insisting upon useless studies; and i quite\\nadmit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye of\\nthe soul which, when by other pursuits lost and dimmed, is by these\\npurified and re-illumined; and is more precious far than ten thousand\\nbodily eyes, for by it alone is truth seen. now there are two classes\\nof persons: one class of those who will agree with you and will take\\nyour words as a revelation; another class to whom they will be utterly\\nunmeaning, and who will naturally deem them to be idle tales, for they\\nsee no sort of profit which is to be obtained from them. and therefore\\nyou had better decide at once with which of the two you are proposing\\nto argue. you will very likely say with neither, and that your chief\\naim in carrying on the argument is your own improvement; at the same\\ntime you do not grudge to others any benefit which they may receive.\\n\\ni think that i should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my own\\nbehalf.\\n\\nthen take a step backward, for we have gone wrong in the order of the\\nsciences.\\n\\nwhat was the mistake? he said.\\n\\nafter plane geometry, i said, we proceeded at once to solids in\\nrevolution, instead of taking solids in themselves; whereas after the\\nsecond dimension the third, which is concerned with cubes and\\ndimensions of depth, ought to have followed.\\n\\nthat is true, socrates; but so little seems to be known as yet about\\nthese subjects.\\n\\nwhy, yes, i said, and for two reasons:—in the first place, no\\ngovernment patronises them; this leads to a want of energy in the\\npursuit of them, and they are difficult; in the second place, students\\ncannot learn them unless they have a director. but then a director can\\nhardly be found, and even if he could, as matters now stand, the\\nstudents, who are very conceited, would not attend to him. that,\\nhowever, would be otherwise if the whole state became the director of\\nthese studies and gave honour to them; then disciples would want to\\ncome, and there would be continuous and earnest search, and discoveries\\nwould be made; since even now, disregarded as they are by the world,\\nand maimed of their fair proportions, and although none of their\\nvotaries can tell the use of them, still these studies force their way\\nby their natural charm, and very likely, if they had the help of the\\nstate, they would some day emerge into light.\\n\\nyes, he said, there is a remarkable charm in them. but i do not clearly\\nunderstand the change in the order. first you began with a geometry of\\nplane surfaces?\\n\\nyes, i said.\\n\\nand you placed astronomy next, and then you made a step backward?\\n\\nyes, and i have delayed you by my hurry; the ludicrous state of solid\\ngeometry, which, in natural order, should have followed, made me pass\\nover this branch and go on to astronomy, or motion of solids.\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nthen assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence if\\nencouraged by the state, let us go on to astronomy, which will be\\nfourth.\\n\\nthe right order, he replied. and now, socrates, as you rebuked the\\nvulgar manner in which i praised astronomy before, my praise shall be\\ngiven in your own spirit. for every one, as i think, must see that\\nastronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world\\nto another.\\n\\nevery one but myself, i said; to every one else this may be clear, but\\nnot to me.\\n\\nand what then would you say?\\n\\ni should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy\\nappear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards.\\n\\nwhat do you mean? he asked.\\n\\nyou, i replied, have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our\\nknowledge of the things above. and i dare say that if a person were to\\nthrow his head back and study the fretted ceiling, you would still\\nthink that his mind was the percipient, and not his eyes. and you are\\nvery likely right, and i may be a simpleton: but, in my opinion, that\\nknowledge only which is of being and of the unseen can make the soul\\nlook upwards, and whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks on the\\nground, seeking to learn some particular of sense, i would deny that he\\ncan learn, for nothing of that sort is matter of science; his soul is\\nlooking downwards, not upwards, whether his way to knowledge is by\\nwater or by land, whether he floats, or only lies on his back.\\n\\ni acknowledge, he said, the justice of your rebuke. still, i should\\nlike to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more\\nconducive to that knowledge of which we are speaking?\\n\\ni will tell you, i said: the starry heaven which we behold is wrought\\nupon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most\\nperfect of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far to\\nthe true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are\\nrelative to each other, and carry with them that which is contained in\\nthem, in the true number and in every true figure. now, these are to be\\napprehended by reason and intelligence, but not by sight.\\n\\ntrue, he replied.\\n\\nthe spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to\\nthat higher knowledge; their beauty is like the beauty of figures or\\npictures excellently wrought by the hand of daedalus, or some other\\ngreat artist, which we may chance to behold; any geometrician who saw\\nthem would appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship, but he\\nwould never dream of thinking that in them he could find the true equal\\nor the true double, or the truth of any other proportion.\\n\\nno, he replied, such an idea would be ridiculous.\\n\\nand will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at\\nthe movements of the stars? will he not think that heaven and the\\nthings in heaven are framed by the creator of them in the most perfect\\nmanner? but he will never imagine that the proportions of night and\\nday, or of both to the month, or of the month to the year, or of the\\nstars to these and to one another, and any other things that are\\nmaterial and visible can also be eternal and subject to no\\ndeviation—that would be absurd; and it is equally absurd to take so\\nmuch pains in investigating their exact truth.\\n\\ni quite agree, though i never thought of this before.\\n\\nthen, i said, in astronomy, as in geometry, we should employ problems,\\nand let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right\\nway and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real use.\\n\\nthat, he said, is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers.\\n\\nyes, i said; and there are many other things which must also have a\\nsimilar extension given to them, if our legislation is to be of any\\nvalue. but can you tell me of any other suitable study?\\n\\nno, he said, not without thinking.\\n\\nmotion, i said, has many forms, and not one only; two of them are\\nobvious enough even to wits no better than ours; and there are others,\\nas i imagine, which may be left to wiser persons.\\n\\nbut where are the two?\\n\\nthere is a second, i said, which is the counterpart of the one already\\nnamed.\\n\\nand what may that be?\\n\\nthe second, i said, would seem relatively to the ears to be what the\\nfirst is to the eyes; for i conceive that as the eyes are designed to\\nlook up at the stars, so are the ears to hear harmonious motions; and\\nthese are sister sciences—as the pythagoreans say, and we, glaucon,\\nagree with them?\\n\\nyes, he replied.\\n\\nbut this, i said, is a laborious study, and therefore we had better go\\nand learn of them; and they will tell us whether there are any other\\napplications of these sciences. at the same time, we must not lose\\nsight of our own higher object.\\n\\nwhat is that?\\n\\nthere is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach, and which our\\npupils ought also to attain, and not to fall short of, as i was saying\\nthat they did in astronomy. for in the science of harmony, as you\\nprobably know, the same thing happens. the teachers of harmony compare\\nthe sounds and consonances which are heard only, and their labour, like\\nthat of the astronomers, is in vain.\\n\\nyes, by heaven! he said; and ’tis as good as a play to hear them\\ntalking about their condensed notes, as they call them; they put their\\nears close alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from\\ntheir neighbour’s wall—one set of them declaring that they distinguish\\nan intermediate note and have found the least interval which should be\\nthe unit of measurement; the others insisting that the two sounds have\\npassed into the same—either party setting their ears before their\\nunderstanding.\\n\\nyou mean, i said, those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and\\nrack them on the pegs of the instrument: i might carry on the metaphor\\nand speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives, and\\nmake accusations against the strings, both of backwardness and\\nforwardness to sound; but this would be tedious, and therefore i will\\nonly say that these are not the men, and that i am referring to the\\npythagoreans, of whom i was just now proposing to enquire about\\nharmony. for they too are in error, like the astronomers; they\\ninvestigate the numbers of the harmonies which are heard, but they\\nnever attain to problems—that is to say, they never reach the natural\\nharmonies of number, or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and\\nothers not.\\n\\nthat, he said, is a thing of more than mortal knowledge.\\n\\na thing, i replied, which i would rather call useful; that is, if\\nsought after with a view to the beautiful and good; but if pursued in\\nany other spirit, useless.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nnow, when all these studies reach the point of inter-communion and\\nconnection with one another, and come to be considered in their mutual\\naffinities, then, i think, but not till then, will the pursuit of them\\nhave a value for our objects; otherwise there is no profit in them.\\n\\ni suspect so; but you are speaking, socrates, of a vast work.\\n\\nwhat do you mean? i said; the prelude or what? do you not know that all\\nthis is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn?\\nfor you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a\\ndialectician?\\n\\nassuredly not, he said; i have hardly ever known a mathematician who\\nwas capable of reasoning.\\n\\nbut do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason\\nwill have the knowledge which we require of them?\\n\\nneither can this be supposed.\\n\\nand so, glaucon, i said, we have at last arrived at the hymn of\\ndialectic. this is that strain which is of the intellect only, but\\nwhich the faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate; for\\nsight, as you may remember, was imagined by us after a while to behold\\nthe real animals and stars, and last of all the sun himself. and so\\nwith dialectic; when a person starts on the discovery of the absolute\\nby the light of reason only, and without any assistance of sense, and\\nperseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives at the perception of\\nthe absolute good, he at last finds himself at the end of the\\nintellectual world, as in the case of sight at the end of the visible.\\n\\nexactly, he said.\\n\\nthen this is the progress which you call dialectic?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nbut the release of the prisoners from chains, and their translation\\nfrom the shadows to the images and to the light, and the ascent from\\nthe underground den to the sun, while in his presence they are vainly\\ntrying to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun, but are\\nable to perceive even with their weak eyes the images in the water\\n(which are divine), and are the shadows of true existence (not shadows\\nof images cast by a light of fire, which compared with the sun is only\\nan image)—this power of elevating the highest principle in the soul to\\nthe contemplation of that which is best in existence, with which we may\\ncompare the raising of that faculty which is the very light of the body\\nto the sight of that which is brightest in the material and visible\\nworld—this power is given, as i was saying, by all that study and\\npursuit of the arts which has been described.\\n\\ni agree in what you are saying, he replied, which may be hard to\\nbelieve, yet, from another point of view, is harder still to deny.\\nthis, however, is not a theme to be treated of in passing only, but\\nwill have to be discussed again and again. and so, whether our\\nconclusion be true or false, let us assume all this, and proceed at\\nonce from the prelude or preamble to the chief strain (a play upon the\\ngreek word, which means both ‘law’ and ‘strain.’), and describe that in\\nlike manner. say, then, what is the nature and what are the divisions\\nof dialectic, and what are the paths which lead thither; for these\\npaths will also lead to our final rest.\\n\\ndear glaucon, i said, you will not be able to follow me here, though i\\nwould do my best, and you should behold not an image only but the\\nabsolute truth, according to my notion. whether what i told you would\\nor would not have been a reality i cannot venture to say; but you would\\nhave seen something like reality; of that i am confident.\\n\\ndoubtless, he replied.\\n\\nbut i must also remind you, that the power of dialectic alone can\\nreveal this, and only to one who is a disciple of the previous\\nsciences.\\n\\nof that assertion you may be as confident as of the last.\\n\\nand assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of\\ncomprehending by any regular process all true existence or of\\nascertaining what each thing is in its own nature; for the arts in\\ngeneral are concerned with the desires or opinions of men, or are\\ncultivated with a view to production and construction, or for the\\npreservation of such productions and constructions; and as to the\\nmathematical sciences which, as we were saying, have some apprehension\\nof true being—geometry and the like—they only dream about being, but\\nnever can they behold the waking reality so long as they leave the\\nhypotheses which they use unexamined, and are unable to give an account\\nof them. for when a man knows not his own first principle, and when the\\nconclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows\\nnot what, how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever\\nbecome science?\\n\\nimpossible, he said.\\n\\nthen dialectic, and dialectic alone, goes directly to the first\\nprinciple and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in\\norder to make her ground secure; the eye of the soul, which is\\nliterally buried in an outlandish slough, is by her gentle aid lifted\\nupwards; and she uses as handmaids and helpers in the work of\\nconversion, the sciences which we have been discussing. custom terms\\nthem sciences, but they ought to have some other name, implying greater\\nclearness than opinion and less clearness than science: and this, in\\nour previous sketch, was called understanding. but why should we\\ndispute about names when we have realities of such importance to\\nconsider?\\n\\nwhy indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought\\nof the mind with clearness?\\n\\nat any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions; two\\nfor intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division\\nscience, the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth\\nperception of shadows, opinion being concerned with becoming, and\\nintellect with being; and so to make a proportion:—\\n\\nas being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion. and as\\nintellect is to opinion, so is science to belief, and understanding to\\nthe perception of shadows.\\n\\nbut let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the\\nsubjects of opinion and of intellect, for it will be a long enquiry,\\nmany times longer than this has been.\\n\\nas far as i understand, he said, i agree.\\n\\nand do you also agree, i said, in describing the dialectician as one\\nwho attains a conception of the essence of each thing? and he who does\\nnot possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in\\nwhatever degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in\\nintelligence? will you admit so much?\\n\\nyes, he said; how can i deny it?\\n\\nand you would say the same of the conception of the good? until the\\nperson is able to abstract and define rationally the idea of good, and\\nunless he can run the gauntlet of all objections, and is ready to\\ndisprove them, not by appeals to opinion, but to absolute truth, never\\nfaltering at any step of the argument—unless he can do all this, you\\nwould say that he knows neither the idea of good nor any other good; he\\napprehends only a shadow, if anything at all, which is given by opinion\\nand not by science;—dreaming and slumbering in this life, before he is\\nwell awake here, he arrives at the world below, and has his final\\nquietus.\\n\\nin all that i should most certainly agree with you.\\n\\nand surely you would not have the children of your ideal state, whom\\nyou are nurturing and educating—if the ideal ever becomes a reality—you\\nwould not allow the future rulers to be like posts (literally ‘lines,’\\nprobably the starting-point of a race-course.), having no reason in\\nthem, and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nthen you will make a law that they shall have such an education as will\\nenable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering\\nquestions?\\n\\nyes, he said, you and i together will make it.\\n\\ndialectic, then, as you will agree, is the coping-stone of the\\nsciences, and is set over them; no other science can be placed\\nhigher—the nature of knowledge can no further go?\\n\\ni agree, he said.\\n\\nbut to whom we are to assign these studies, and in what way they are to\\nbe assigned, are questions which remain to be considered.\\n\\nyes, clearly.\\n\\nyou remember, i said, how the rulers were chosen before?\\n\\ncertainly, he said.\\n\\nthe same natures must still be chosen, and the preference again given\\nto the surest and the bravest, and, if possible, to the fairest; and,\\nhaving noble and generous tempers, they should also have the natural\\ngifts which will facilitate their education.\\n\\nand what are these?\\n\\nsuch gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition; for the mind\\nmore often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of\\ngymnastics: the toil is more entirely the mind’s own, and is not shared\\nwith the body.\\n\\nvery true, he replied.\\n\\nfurther, he of whom we are in search should have a good memory, and be\\nan unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line; or he will\\nnever be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go\\nthrough all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of\\nhim.\\n\\ncertainly, he said; he must have natural gifts.\\n\\nthe mistake at present is, that those who study philosophy have no\\nvocation, and this, as i was before saying, is the reason why she has\\nfallen into disrepute: her true sons should take her by the hand and\\nnot bastards.\\n\\nwhat do you mean?\\n\\nin the first place, her votary should not have a lame or halting\\nindustry—i mean, that he should not be half industrious and half idle:\\nas, for example, when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting, and\\nall other bodily exercises, but a hater rather than a lover of the\\nlabour of learning or listening or enquiring. or the occupation to\\nwhich he devotes himself may be of an opposite kind, and he may have\\nthe other sort of lameness.\\n\\ncertainly, he said.\\n\\nand as to truth, i said, is not a soul equally to be deemed halt and\\nlame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at\\nherself and others when they tell lies, but is patient of involuntary\\nfalsehood, and does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire\\nof ignorance, and has no shame at being detected?\\n\\nto be sure.\\n\\nand, again, in respect of temperance, courage, magnificence, and every\\nother virtue, should we not carefully distinguish between the true son\\nand the bastard? for where there is no discernment of such qualities\\nstates and individuals unconsciously err; and the state makes a ruler,\\nand the individual a friend, of one who, being defective in some part\\nof virtue, is in a figure lame or a bastard.\\n\\nthat is very true, he said.\\n\\nall these things, then, will have to be carefully considered by us; and\\nif only those whom we introduce to this vast system of education and\\ntraining are sound in body and mind, justice herself will have nothing\\nto say against us, and we shall be the saviours of the constitution and\\nof the state; but, if our pupils are men of another stamp, the reverse\\nwill happen, and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule on\\nphilosophy than she has to endure at present.\\n\\nthat would not be creditable.\\n\\ncertainly not, i said; and yet perhaps, in thus turning jest into\\nearnest i am equally ridiculous.\\n\\nin what respect?\\n\\ni had forgotten, i said, that we were not serious, and spoke with too\\nmuch excitement. for when i saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled\\nunder foot of men i could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the\\nauthors of her disgrace: and my anger made me too vehement.\\n\\nindeed! i was listening, and did not think so.\\n\\nbut i, who am the speaker, felt that i was. and now let me remind you\\nthat, although in our former selection we chose old men, we must not do\\nso in this. solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he\\ngrows old may learn many things—for he can no more learn much than he\\ncan run much; youth is the time for any extraordinary toil.\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nand, therefore, calculation and geometry and all the other elements of\\ninstruction, which are a preparation for dialectic, should be presented\\nto the mind in childhood; not, however, under any notion of forcing our\\nsystem of education.\\n\\nwhy not?\\n\\nbecause a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of\\nknowledge of any kind. bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm\\nto the body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains\\nno hold on the mind.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nthen, my good friend, i said, do not use compulsion, but let early\\neducation be a sort of amusement; you will then be better able to find\\nout the natural bent.\\n\\nthat is a very rational notion, he said.\\n\\ndo you remember that the children, too, were to be taken to see the\\nbattle on horseback; and that if there were no danger they were to be\\nbrought close up and, like young hounds, have a taste of blood given\\nthem?\\n\\nyes, i remember.\\n\\nthe same practice may be followed, i said, in all these things—labours,\\nlessons, dangers—and he who is most at home in all of them ought to be\\nenrolled in a select number.\\n\\nat what age?\\n\\nat the age when the necessary gymnastics are over: the period whether\\nof two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless\\nfor any other purpose; for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to\\nlearning; and the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one\\nof the most important tests to which our youth are subjected.\\n\\ncertainly, he replied.\\n\\nafter that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years\\nold will be promoted to higher honour, and the sciences which they\\nlearned without any order in their early education will now be brought\\ntogether, and they will be able to see the natural relationship of them\\nto one another and to true being.\\n\\nyes, he said, that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting\\nroot.\\n\\nyes, i said; and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion\\nof dialectical talent: the comprehensive mind is always the\\ndialectical.\\n\\ni agree with you, he said.\\n\\nthese, i said, are the points which you must consider; and those who\\nhave most of this comprehension, and who are most steadfast in their\\nlearning, and in their military and other appointed duties, when they\\nhave arrived at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of the\\nselect class, and elevated to higher honour; and you will have to prove\\nthem by the help of dialectic, in order to learn which of them is able\\nto give up the use of sight and the other senses, and in company with\\ntruth to attain absolute being: and here, my friend, great caution is\\nrequired.\\n\\nwhy great caution?\\n\\ndo you not remark, i said, how great is the evil which dialectic has\\nintroduced?\\n\\nwhat evil? he said.\\n\\nthe students of the art are filled with lawlessness.\\n\\nquite true, he said.\\n\\ndo you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in\\ntheir case? or will you make allowance for them?\\n\\nin what way make allowance?\\n\\ni want you, i said, by way of parallel, to imagine a supposititious son\\nwho is brought up in great wealth; he is one of a great and numerous\\nfamily, and has many flatterers. when he grows up to manhood, he learns\\nthat his alleged are not his real parents; but who the real are he is\\nunable to discover. can you guess how he will be likely to behave\\ntowards his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during\\nthe period when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again\\nwhen he knows? or shall i guess for you?\\n\\nif you please.\\n\\nthen i should say, that while he is ignorant of the truth he will be\\nlikely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations\\nmore than the flatterers; he will be less inclined to neglect them when\\nin need, or to do or say anything against them; and he will be less\\nwilling to disobey them in any important matter.\\n\\nhe will.\\n\\nbut when he has made the discovery, i should imagine that he would\\ndiminish his honour and regard for them, and would become more devoted\\nto the flatterers; their influence over him would greatly increase; he\\nwould now live after their ways, and openly associate with them, and,\\nunless he were of an unusually good disposition, he would trouble\\nhimself no more about his supposed parents or other relations.\\n\\nwell, all that is very probable. but how is the image applicable to the\\ndisciples of philosophy?\\n\\nin this way: you know that there are certain principles about justice\\nand honour, which were taught us in childhood, and under their parental\\nauthority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring them.\\n\\nthat is true.\\n\\nthere are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter and\\nattract the soul, but do not influence those of us who have any sense\\nof right, and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their\\nfathers.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nnow, when a man is in this state, and the questioning spirit asks what\\nis fair or honourable, and he answers as the legislator has taught him,\\nand then arguments many and diverse refute his words, until he is\\ndriven into believing that nothing is honourable any more than\\ndishonourable, or just and good any more than the reverse, and so of\\nall the notions which he most valued, do you think that he will still\\nhonour and obey them as before?\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nand when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore,\\nand he fails to discover the true, can he be expected to pursue any\\nlife other than that which flatters his desires?\\n\\nhe cannot.\\n\\nand from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of\\nit?\\n\\nunquestionably.\\n\\nnow all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as i have\\ndescribed, and also, as i was just now saying, most excusable.\\n\\nyes, he said; and, i may add, pitiable.\\n\\ntherefore, that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our\\ncitizens who are now thirty years of age, every care must be taken in\\nintroducing them to dialectic.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nthere is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early;\\nfor youngsters, as you may have observed, when they first get the taste\\nin their mouths, argue for amusement, and are always contradicting and\\nrefuting others in imitation of those who refute them; like puppy-dogs,\\nthey rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near them.\\n\\nyes, he said, there is nothing which they like better.\\n\\nand when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the\\nhands of many, they violently and speedily get into a way of not\\nbelieving anything which they believed before, and hence, not only\\nthey, but philosophy and all that relates to it is apt to have a bad\\nname with the rest of the world.\\n\\ntoo true, he said.\\n\\nbut when a man begins to get older, he will no longer be guilty of such\\ninsanity; he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth,\\nand not the eristic, who is contradicting for the sake of amusement;\\nand the greater moderation of his character will increase instead of\\ndiminishing the honour of the pursuit.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nand did we not make special provision for this, when we said that the\\ndisciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast, not, as now,\\nany chance aspirant or intruder?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nsuppose, i said, the study of philosophy to take the place of\\ngymnastics and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively\\nfor twice the number of years which were passed in bodily exercise—will\\nthat be enough?\\n\\nwould you say six or four years? he asked.\\n\\nsay five years, i replied; at the end of the time they must be sent\\ndown again into the den and compelled to hold any military or other\\noffice which young men are qualified to hold: in this way they will get\\ntheir experience of life, and there will be an opportunity of trying\\nwhether, when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation, they\\nwill stand firm or flinch.\\n\\nand how long is this stage of their lives to last?\\n\\nfifteen years, i answered; and when they have reached fifty years of\\nage, then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves\\nin every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at\\nlast to their consummation: the time has now arrived at which they must\\nraise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all\\nthings, and behold the absolute good; for that is the pattern according\\nto which they are to order the state and the lives of individuals, and\\nthe remainder of their own lives also; making philosophy their chief\\npursuit, but, when their turn comes, toiling also at politics and\\nruling for the public good, not as though they were performing some\\nheroic action, but simply as a matter of duty; and when they have\\nbrought up in each generation others like themselves and left them in\\ntheir place to be governors of the state, then they will depart to the\\nislands of the blest and dwell there; and the city will give them\\npublic memorials and sacrifices and honour them, if the pythian oracle\\nconsent, as demigods, but if not, as in any case blessed and divine.\\n\\nyou are a sculptor, socrates, and have made statues of our governors\\nfaultless in beauty.\\n\\nyes, i said, glaucon, and of our governesses too; for you must not\\nsuppose that what i have been saying applies to men only and not to\\nwomen as far as their natures can go.\\n\\nthere you are right, he said, since we have made them to share in all\\nthings like the men.\\n\\nwell, i said, and you would agree (would you not?) that what has been\\nsaid about the state and the government is not a mere dream, and\\nalthough difficult not impossible, but only possible in the way which\\nhas been supposed; that is to say, when the true philosopher kings are\\nborn in a state, one or more of them, despising the honours of this\\npresent world which they deem mean and worthless, esteeming above all\\nthings right and the honour that springs from right, and regarding\\njustice as the greatest and most necessary of all things, whose\\nministers they are, and whose principles will be exalted by them when\\nthey set in order their own city?\\n\\nhow will they proceed?\\n\\nthey will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants of\\nthe city who are more than ten years old, and will take possession of\\ntheir children, who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents;\\nthese they will train in their own habits and laws, i mean in the laws\\nwhich we have given them: and in this way the state and constitution of\\nwhich we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness,\\nand the nation which has such a constitution will gain most.\\n\\nyes, that will be the best way. and i think, socrates, that you have\\nvery well described how, if ever, such a constitution might come into\\nbeing.\\n\\nenough then of the perfect state, and of the man who bears its\\nimage—there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him.\\n\\nthere is no difficulty, he replied; and i agree with you in thinking\\nthat nothing more need be said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book viii.\\n\\n\\nand so, glaucon, we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect\\nstate wives and children are to be in common; and that all education\\nand the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common, and the best\\nphilosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings?\\n\\nthat, replied glaucon, has been acknowledged.\\n\\nyes, i said; and we have further acknowledged that the governors, when\\nappointed themselves, will take their soldiers and place them in houses\\nsuch as we were describing, which are common to all, and contain\\nnothing private, or individual; and about their property, you remember\\nwhat we agreed?\\n\\nyes, i remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions\\nof mankind; they were to be warrior athletes and guardians, receiving\\nfrom the other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only their\\nmaintenance, and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole\\nstate.\\n\\ntrue, i said; and now that this division of our task is concluded, let\\nus find the point at which we digressed, that we may return into the\\nold path.\\n\\nthere is no difficulty in returning; you implied, then as now, that you\\nhad finished the description of the state: you said that such a state\\nwas good, and that the man was good who answered to it, although, as\\nnow appears, you had more excellent things to relate both of state and\\nman. and you said further, that if this was the true form, then the\\nothers were false; and of the false forms, you said, as i remember,\\nthat there were four principal ones, and that their defects, and the\\ndefects of the individuals corresponding to them, were worth examining.\\nwhen we had seen all the individuals, and finally agreed as to who was\\nthe best and who was the worst of them, we were to consider whether the\\nbest was not also the happiest, and the worst the most miserable. i\\nasked you what were the four forms of government of which you spoke,\\nand then polemarchus and adeimantus put in their word; and you began\\nagain, and have found your way to the point at which we have now\\narrived.\\n\\nyour recollection, i said, is most exact.\\n\\nthen, like a wrestler, he replied, you must put yourself again in the\\nsame position; and let me ask the same questions, and do you give me\\nthe same answer which you were about to give me then.\\n\\nyes, if i can, i will, i said.\\n\\ni shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions of\\nwhich you were speaking.\\n\\nthat question, i said, is easily answered: the four governments of\\nwhich i spoke, so far as they have distinct names, are, first, those of\\ncrete and sparta, which are generally applauded; what is termed\\noligarchy comes next; this is not equally approved, and is a form of\\ngovernment which teems with evils: thirdly, democracy, which naturally\\nfollows oligarchy, although very different: and lastly comes tyranny,\\ngreat and famous, which differs from them all, and is the fourth and\\nworst disorder of a state. i do not know, do you? of any other\\nconstitution which can be said to have a distinct character. there are\\nlordships and principalities which are bought and sold, and some other\\nintermediate forms of government. but these are nondescripts and may be\\nfound equally among hellenes and among barbarians.\\n\\nyes, he replied, we certainly hear of many curious forms of government\\nwhich exist among them.\\n\\ndo you know, i said, that governments vary as the dispositions of men\\nvary, and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the\\nother? for we cannot suppose that states are made of ‘oak and rock,’\\nand not out of the human natures which are in them, and which in a\\nfigure turn the scale and draw other things after them?\\n\\nyes, he said, the states are as the men are; they grow out of human\\ncharacters.\\n\\nthen if the constitutions of states are five, the dispositions of\\nindividual minds will also be five?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nhim who answers to aristocracy, and whom we rightly call just and good,\\nwe have already described.\\n\\nwe have.\\n\\nthen let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures, being\\nthe contentious and ambitious, who answer to the spartan polity; also\\nthe oligarchical, democratical, and tyrannical. let us place the most\\njust by the side of the most unjust, and when we see them we shall be\\nable to compare the relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads\\na life of pure justice or pure injustice. the enquiry will then be\\ncompleted. and we shall know whether we ought to pursue injustice, as\\nthrasymachus advises, or in accordance with the conclusions of the\\nargument to prefer justice.\\n\\ncertainly, he replied, we must do as you say.\\n\\nshall we follow our old plan, which we adopted with a view to\\nclearness, of taking the state first and then proceeding to the\\nindividual, and begin with the government of honour?—i know of no name\\nfor such a government other than timocracy, or perhaps timarchy. we\\nwill compare with this the like character in the individual; and, after\\nthat, consider oligarchy and the oligarchical man; and then again we\\nwill turn our attention to democracy and the democratical man; and\\nlastly, we will go and view the city of tyranny, and once more take a\\nlook into the tyrant’s soul, and try to arrive at a satisfactory\\ndecision.\\n\\nthat way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very suitable.\\n\\nfirst, then, i said, let us enquire how timocracy (the government of\\nhonour) arises out of aristocracy (the government of the best).\\nclearly, all political changes originate in divisions of the actual\\ngoverning power; a government which is united, however small, cannot be\\nmoved.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nin what way, then, will our city be moved, and in what manner will the\\ntwo classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with\\none another? shall we, after the manner of homer, pray the muses to\\ntell us ‘how discord first arose’? shall we imagine them in solemn\\nmockery, to play and jest with us as if we were children, and to\\naddress us in a lofty tragic vein, making believe to be in earnest?\\n\\nhow would they address us?\\n\\nafter this manner:—a city which is thus constituted can hardly be\\nshaken; but, seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an\\nend, even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever, but will\\nin time be dissolved. and this is the dissolution:—in plants that grow\\nin the earth, as well as in animals that move on the earth’s surface,\\nfertility and sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences\\nof the circles of each are completed, which in short-lived existences\\npass over a short space, and in long-lived ones over a long space. but\\nto the knowledge of human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom and\\neducation of your rulers will not attain; the laws which regulate them\\nwill not be discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed with sense,\\nbut will escape them, and they will bring children into the world when\\nthey ought not. now that which is of divine birth has a period which is\\ncontained in a perfect number (i.e. a cyclical number, such as 6, which\\nis equal to the sum of its divisors 1, 2, 3, so that when the circle or\\ntime represented by 6 is completed, the lesser times or rotations\\nrepresented by 1, 2, 3 are also completed.), but the period of human\\nbirth is comprehended in a number in which first increments by\\ninvolution and evolution (or squared and cubed) obtaining three\\nintervals and four terms of like and unlike, waxing and waning numbers,\\nmake all the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another.\\n(probably the numbers 3, 4, 5, 6 of which the three first = the sides\\nof the pythagorean triangle. the terms will then be 3 cubed, 4 cubed, 5\\ncubed, which together = 6 cubed = 216.) the base of these (3) with a\\nthird added (4) when combined with five (20) and raised to the third\\npower furnishes two harmonies; the first a square which is a hundred\\ntimes as great (400 = 4 x 100) (or the first a square which is 100 x\\n100 = 10,000. the whole number will then be 17,500 = a square of 100,\\nand an oblong of 100 by 75.), and the other a figure having one side\\nequal to the former, but oblong, consisting of a hundred numbers\\nsquared upon rational diameters of a square (i.e. omitting fractions),\\nthe side of which is five (7 x 7 = 49 x 100 = 4900), each of them being\\nless by one (than the perfect square which includes the fractions, sc.\\n50) or less by (or, ‘consisting of two numbers squared upon irrational\\ndiameters,’ etc. = 100. for other explanations of the passage see\\nintroduction.) two perfect squares of irrational diameters (of a square\\nthe side of which is five = 50 + 50 = 100); and a hundred cubes of\\nthree (27 x 100 = 2700 + 4900 + 400 = 8000). now this number represents\\na geometrical figure which has control over the good and evil of\\nbirths. for when your guardians are ignorant of the law of births, and\\nunite bride and bridegroom out of season, the children will not be\\ngoodly or fortunate. and though only the best of them will be appointed\\nby their predecessors, still they will be unworthy to hold their\\nfathers’ places, and when they come into power as guardians, they will\\nsoon be found to fail in taking care of us, the muses, first by\\nunder-valuing music; which neglect will soon extend to gymnastic; and\\nhence the young men of your state will be less cultivated. in the\\nsucceeding generation rulers will be appointed who have lost the\\nguardian power of testing the metal of your different races, which,\\nlike hesiod’s, are of gold and silver and brass and iron. and so iron\\nwill be mingled with silver, and brass with gold, and hence there will\\narise dissimilarity and inequality and irregularity, which always and\\nin all places are causes of hatred and war. this the muses affirm to be\\nthe stock from which discord has sprung, wherever arising; and this is\\ntheir answer to us.\\n\\nyes, and we may assume that they answer truly.\\n\\nwhy, yes, i said, of course they answer truly; how can the muses speak\\nfalsely?\\n\\nand what do the muses say next?\\n\\nwhen discord arose, then the two races were drawn different ways: the\\niron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and\\nsilver; but the gold and silver races, not wanting money but having the\\ntrue riches in their own nature, inclined towards virtue and the\\nancient order of things. there was a battle between them, and at last\\nthey agreed to distribute their land and houses among individual\\nowners; and they enslaved their friends and maintainers, whom they had\\nformerly protected in the condition of freemen, and made of them\\nsubjects and servants; and they themselves were engaged in war and in\\nkeeping a watch against them.\\n\\ni believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change.\\n\\nand the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate\\nbetween oligarchy and aristocracy?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nsuch will be the change, and after the change has been made, how will\\nthey proceed? clearly, the new state, being in a mean between oligarchy\\nand the perfect state, will partly follow one and partly the other, and\\nwill also have some peculiarities.\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nin the honour given to rulers, in the abstinence of the warrior class\\nfrom agriculture, handicrafts, and trade in general, in the institution\\nof common meals, and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military\\ntraining—in all these respects this state will resemble the former.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nbut in the fear of admitting philosophers to power, because they are no\\nlonger to be had simple and earnest, but are made up of mixed elements;\\nand in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters, who\\nare by nature fitted for war rather than peace; and in the value set by\\nthem upon military stratagems and contrivances, and in the waging of\\neverlasting wars—this state will be for the most part peculiar.\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nyes, i said; and men of this stamp will be covetous of money, like\\nthose who live in oligarchies; they will have, a fierce secret longing\\nafter gold and silver, which they will hoard in dark places, having\\nmagazines and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment\\nof them; also castles which are just nests for their eggs, and in which\\nthey will spend large sums on their wives, or on any others whom they\\nplease.\\n\\nthat is most true, he said.\\n\\nand they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring the\\nmoney which they prize; they will spend that which is another man’s on\\nthe gratification of their desires, stealing their pleasures and\\nrunning away like children from the law, their father: they have been\\nschooled not by gentle influences but by force, for they have neglected\\nher who is the true muse, the companion of reason and philosophy, and\\nhave honoured gymnastic more than music.\\n\\nundoubtedly, he said, the form of government which you describe is a\\nmixture of good and evil.\\n\\nwhy, there is a mixture, i said; but one thing, and one thing only, is\\npredominantly seen,—the spirit of contention and ambition; and these\\nare due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element.\\n\\nassuredly, he said.\\n\\nsuch is the origin and such the character of this state, which has been\\ndescribed in outline only; the more perfect execution was not required,\\nfor a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and\\nmost perfectly unjust; and to go through all the states and all the\\ncharacters of men, omitting none of them, would be an interminable\\nlabour.\\n\\nvery true, he replied.\\n\\nnow what man answers to this form of government-how did he come into\\nbeing, and what is he like?\\n\\ni think, said adeimantus, that in the spirit of contention which\\ncharacterises him, he is not unlike our friend glaucon.\\n\\nperhaps, i said, he may be like him in that one point; but there are\\nother respects in which he is very different.\\n\\nin what respects?\\n\\nhe should have more of self-assertion and be less cultivated, and yet a\\nfriend of culture; and he should be a good listener, but no speaker.\\nsuch a person is apt to be rough with slaves, unlike the educated man,\\nwho is too proud for that; and he will also be courteous to freemen,\\nand remarkably obedient to authority; he is a lover of power and a\\nlover of honour; claiming to be a ruler, not because he is eloquent, or\\non any ground of that sort, but because he is a soldier and has\\nperformed feats of arms; he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and\\nof the chase.\\n\\nyes, that is the type of character which answers to timocracy.\\n\\nsuch an one will despise riches only when he is young; but as he gets\\nolder he will be more and more attracted to them, because he has a\\npiece of the avaricious nature in him, and is not single-minded towards\\nvirtue, having lost his best guardian.\\n\\nwho was that? said adeimantus.\\n\\nphilosophy, i said, tempered with music, who comes and takes up her\\nabode in a man, and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life.\\n\\ngood, he said.\\n\\nsuch, i said, is the timocratical youth, and he is like the\\ntimocratical state.\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nhis origin is as follows:—he is often the young son of a brave father,\\nwho dwells in an ill-governed city, of which he declines the honours\\nand offices, and will not go to law, or exert himself in any way, but\\nis ready to waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble.\\n\\nand how does the son come into being?\\n\\nthe character of the son begins to develope when he hears his mother\\ncomplaining that her husband has no place in the government, of which\\nthe consequence is that she has no precedence among other women.\\nfurther, when she sees her husband not very eager about money, and\\ninstead of battling and railing in the law courts or assembly, taking\\nwhatever happens to him quietly; and when she observes that his\\nthoughts always centre in himself, while he treats her with very\\nconsiderable indifference, she is annoyed, and says to her son that his\\nfather is only half a man and far too easy-going: adding all the other\\ncomplaints about her own ill-treatment which women are so fond of\\nrehearsing.\\n\\nyes, said adeimantus, they give us plenty of them, and their complaints\\nare so like themselves.\\n\\nand you know, i said, that the old servants also, who are supposed to\\nbe attached to the family, from time to time talk privately in the same\\nstrain to the son; and if they see any one who owes money to his\\nfather, or is wronging him in any way, and he fails to prosecute them,\\nthey tell the youth that when he grows up he must retaliate upon people\\nof this sort, and be more of a man than his father. he has only to walk\\nabroad and he hears and sees the same sort of thing: those who do their\\nown business in the city are called simpletons, and held in no esteem,\\nwhile the busy-bodies are honoured and applauded. the result is that\\nthe young man, hearing and seeing all these things—hearing, too, the\\nwords of his father, and having a nearer view of his way of life, and\\nmaking comparisons of him and others—is drawn opposite ways: while his\\nfather is watering and nourishing the rational principle in his soul,\\nthe others are encouraging the passionate and appetitive; and he being\\nnot originally of a bad nature, but having kept bad company, is at last\\nbrought by their joint influence to a middle point, and gives up the\\nkingdom which is within him to the middle principle of contentiousness\\nand passion, and becomes arrogant and ambitious.\\n\\nyou seem to me to have described his origin perfectly.\\n\\nthen we have now, i said, the second form of government and the second\\ntype of character?\\n\\nwe have.\\n\\nnext, let us look at another man who, as aeschylus says,\\n\\n‘is set over against another state;’\\n\\nor rather, as our plan requires, begin with the state.\\n\\nby all means.\\n\\ni believe that oligarchy follows next in order.\\n\\nand what manner of government do you term oligarchy?\\n\\na government resting on a valuation of property, in which the rich have\\npower and the poor man is deprived of it.\\n\\ni understand, he replied.\\n\\nought i not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to\\noligarchy arises?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nwell, i said, no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes\\ninto the other.\\n\\nhow?\\n\\nthe accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is the\\nruin of timocracy; they invent illegal modes of expenditure; for what\\ndo they or their wives care about the law?\\n\\nyes, indeed.\\n\\nand then one, seeing another grow rich, seeks to rival him, and thus\\nthe great mass of the citizens become lovers of money.\\n\\nlikely enough.\\n\\nand so they grow richer and richer, and the more they think of making a\\nfortune the less they think of virtue; for when riches and virtue are\\nplaced together in the scales of the balance, the one always rises as\\nthe other falls.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the state,\\nvirtue and the virtuous are dishonoured.\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nand what is honoured is cultivated, and that which has no honour is\\nneglected.\\n\\nthat is obvious.\\n\\nand so at last, instead of loving contention and glory, men become\\nlovers of trade and money; they honour and look up to the rich man, and\\nmake a ruler of him, and dishonour the poor man.\\n\\nthey do so.\\n\\nthey next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the\\nqualification of citizenship; the sum is higher in one place and lower\\nin another, as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive; and they allow\\nno one whose property falls below the amount fixed to have any share in\\nthe government. these changes in the constitution they effect by force\\nof arms, if intimidation has not already done their work.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand this, speaking generally, is the way in which oligarchy is\\nestablished.\\n\\nyes, he said; but what are the characteristics of this form of\\ngovernment, and what are the defects of which we were speaking?\\n\\nfirst of all, i said, consider the nature of the qualification. just\\nthink what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their\\nproperty, and a poor man were refused permission to steer, even though\\nhe were a better pilot?\\n\\nyou mean that they would shipwreck?\\n\\nyes; and is not this true of the government of anything?\\n\\ni should imagine so.\\n\\nexcept a city?—or would you include a city?\\n\\nnay, he said, the case of a city is the strongest of all, inasmuch as\\nthe rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all.\\n\\nthis, then, will be the first great defect of oligarchy?\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nand here is another defect which is quite as bad.\\n\\nwhat defect?\\n\\nthe inevitable division: such a state is not one, but two states, the\\none of poor, the other of rich men; and they are living on the same\\nspot and always conspiring against one another.\\n\\nthat, surely, is at least as bad.\\n\\nanother discreditable feature is, that, for a like reason, they are\\nincapable of carrying on any war. either they arm the multitude, and\\nthen they are more afraid of them than of the enemy; or, if they do not\\ncall them out in the hour of battle, they are oligarchs indeed, few to\\nfight as they are few to rule. and at the same time their fondness for\\nmoney makes them unwilling to pay taxes.\\n\\nhow discreditable!\\n\\nand, as we said before, under such a constitution the same persons have\\ntoo many callings—they are husbandmen, tradesmen, warriors, all in one.\\ndoes that look well?\\n\\nanything but well.\\n\\nthere is another evil which is, perhaps, the greatest of all, and to\\nwhich this state first begins to be liable.\\n\\nwhat evil?\\n\\na man may sell all that he has, and another may acquire his property;\\nyet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a\\npart, being neither trader, nor artisan, nor horseman, nor hoplite, but\\nonly a poor, helpless creature.\\n\\nyes, that is an evil which also first begins in this state.\\n\\nthe evil is certainly not prevented there; for oligarchies have both\\nthe extremes of great wealth and utter poverty.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nbut think again: in his wealthy days, while he was spending his money,\\nwas a man of this sort a whit more good to the state for the purposes\\nof citizenship? or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body,\\nalthough in truth he was neither ruler nor subject, but just a\\nspendthrift?\\n\\nas you say, he seemed to be a ruler, but was only a spendthrift.\\n\\nmay we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the\\ndrone in the honeycomb, and that the one is the plague of the city as\\nthe other is of the hive?\\n\\njust so, socrates.\\n\\nand god has made the flying drones, adeimantus, all without stings,\\nwhereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but\\nothers have dreadful stings; of the stingless class are those who in\\ntheir old age end as paupers; of the stingers come all the criminal\\nclass, as they are termed.\\n\\nmost true, he said.\\n\\nclearly then, whenever you see paupers in a state, somewhere in that\\nneighborhood there are hidden away thieves, and cut-purses and robbers\\nof temples, and all sorts of malefactors.\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nwell, i said, and in oligarchical states do you not find paupers?\\n\\nyes, he said; nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler.\\n\\nand may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals\\nto be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities\\nare careful to restrain by force?\\n\\ncertainly, we may be so bold.\\n\\nthe existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education,\\nill-training, and an evil constitution of the state?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nsuch, then, is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy; and there\\nmay be many other evils.\\n\\nvery likely.\\n\\nthen oligarchy, or the form of government in which the rulers are\\nelected for their wealth, may now be dismissed. let us next proceed to\\nconsider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this\\nstate.\\n\\nby all means.\\n\\ndoes not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this\\nwise?\\n\\nhow?\\n\\na time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son: at first\\nhe begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps, but\\npresently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the state as upon\\na sunken reef, and he and all that he has is lost; he may have been a\\ngeneral or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a\\nprejudice raised by informers, and either put to death, or exiled, or\\ndeprived of the privileges of a citizen, and all his property taken\\nfrom him.\\n\\nnothing more likely.\\n\\nand the son has seen and known all this—he is a ruined man, and his\\nfear has taught him to knock ambition and passion headforemost from his\\nbosom’s throne; humbled by poverty he takes to money-making and by mean\\nand miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together. is not such\\nan one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the\\nvacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him, girt\\nwith tiara and chain and scimitar?\\n\\nmost true, he replied.\\n\\nand when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground\\nobediently on either side of their sovereign, and taught them to know\\ntheir place, he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be\\nturned into larger ones, and will not allow the other to worship and\\nadmire anything but riches and rich men, or to be ambitious of anything\\nso much as the acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it.\\n\\nof all changes, he said, there is none so speedy or so sure as the\\nconversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one.\\n\\nand the avaricious, i said, is the oligarchical youth?\\n\\nyes, he said; at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like\\nthe state out of which oligarchy came.\\n\\nlet us then consider whether there is any likeness between them.\\n\\nvery good.\\n\\nfirst, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set upon\\nwealth?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nalso in their penurious, laborious character; the individual only\\nsatisfies his necessary appetites, and confines his expenditure to\\nthem; his other desires he subdues, under the idea that they are\\nunprofitable.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nhe is a shabby fellow, who saves something out of everything and makes\\na purse for himself; and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar\\napplaud. is he not a true image of the state which he represents?\\n\\nhe appears to me to be so; at any rate money is highly valued by him as\\nwell as by the state.\\n\\nyou see that he is not a man of cultivation, i said.\\n\\ni imagine not, he said; had he been educated he would never have made a\\nblind god director of his chorus, or given him chief honour.\\n\\nexcellent! i said. yet consider: must we not further admit that owing\\nto this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike\\ndesires as of pauper and rogue, which are forcibly kept down by his\\ngeneral habit of life?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\ndo you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his\\nrogueries?\\n\\nwhere must i look?\\n\\nyou should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting\\ndishonestly, as in the guardianship of an orphan.\\n\\naye.\\n\\nit will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give\\nhim a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced\\nvirtue; not making them see that they are wrong, or taming them by\\nreason, but by necessity and fear constraining them, and because he\\ntrembles for his possessions.\\n\\nto be sure.\\n\\nyes, indeed, my dear friend, but you will find that the natural desires\\nof the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to\\nspend what is not his own.\\n\\nyes, and they will be strong in him too.\\n\\nthe man, then, will be at war with himself; he will be two men, and not\\none; but, in general, his better desires will be found to prevail over\\nhis inferior ones.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nfor these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most\\npeople; yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will\\nflee far away and never come near him.\\n\\ni should expect so.\\n\\nand surely, the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in a\\nstate for any prize of victory, or other object of honourable ambition;\\nhe will not spend his money in the contest for glory; so afraid is he\\nof awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join\\nin the struggle; in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small\\npart only of his resources, and the result commonly is that he loses\\nthe prize and saves his money.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\ncan we any longer doubt, then, that the miser and money-maker answers\\nto the oligarchical state?\\n\\nthere can be no doubt.\\n\\nnext comes democracy; of this the origin and nature have still to be\\nconsidered by us; and then we will enquire into the ways of the\\ndemocratic man, and bring him up for judgment.\\n\\nthat, he said, is our method.\\n\\nwell, i said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy\\narise? is it not on this wise?—the good at which such a state aims is\\nto become as rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?\\n\\nwhat then?\\n\\nthe rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth,\\nrefuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth\\nbecause they gain by their ruin; they take interest from them and buy\\nup their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance?\\n\\nto be sure.\\n\\nthere can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of\\nmoderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any\\nconsiderable extent; one or the other will be disregarded.\\n\\nthat is tolerably clear.\\n\\nand in oligarchical states, from the general spread of carelessness and\\nextravagance, men of good family have often been reduced to beggary?\\n\\nyes, often.\\n\\nand still they remain in the city; there they are, ready to sting and\\nfully armed, and some of them owe money, some have forfeited their\\ncitizenship; a third class are in both predicaments; and they hate and\\nconspire against those who have got their property, and against\\neverybody else, and are eager for revolution.\\n\\nthat is true.\\n\\non the other hand, the men of business, stooping as they walk, and\\npretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined, insert\\ntheir sting—that is, their money—into some one else who is not on his\\nguard against them, and recover the parent sum many times over\\nmultiplied into a family of children: and so they make drone and pauper\\nto abound in the state.\\n\\nyes, he said, there are plenty of them—that is certain.\\n\\nthe evil blazes up like a fire; and they will not extinguish it, either\\nby restricting a man’s use of his own property, or by another remedy:\\n\\nwhat other?\\n\\none which is the next best, and has the advantage of compelling the\\ncitizens to look to their characters:—let there be a general rule that\\nevery one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk, and\\nthere will be less of this scandalous money-making, and the evils of\\nwhich we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the state.\\n\\nyes, they will be greatly lessened.\\n\\nat present the governors, induced by the motives which i have named,\\ntreat their subjects badly; while they and their adherents, especially\\nthe young men of the governing class, are habituated to lead a life of\\nluxury and idleness both of body and mind; they do nothing, and are\\nincapable of resisting either pleasure or pain.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nthey themselves care only for making money, and are as indifferent as\\nthe pauper to the cultivation of virtue.\\n\\nyes, quite as indifferent.\\n\\nsuch is the state of affairs which prevails among them. and often\\nrulers and their subjects may come in one another’s way, whether on a\\njourney or on some other occasion of meeting, on a pilgrimage or a\\nmarch, as fellow-soldiers or fellow-sailors; aye and they may observe\\nthe behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger—for where\\ndanger is, there is no fear that the poor will be despised by the\\nrich—and very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle\\nat the side of a wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and\\nhas plenty of superfluous flesh—when he sees such an one puffing and at\\nhis wits’-end, how can he avoid drawing the conclusion that men like\\nhim are only rich because no one has the courage to despoil them? and\\nwhen they meet in private will not people be saying to one another ‘our\\nwarriors are not good for much’?\\n\\nyes, he said, i am quite aware that this is their way of talking.\\n\\nand, as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from\\nwithout may bring on illness, and sometimes even when there is no\\nexternal provocation a commotion may arise within—in the same way\\nwherever there is weakness in the state there is also likely to be\\nillness, of which the occasion may be very slight, the one party\\nintroducing from without their oligarchical, the other their\\ndemocratical allies, and then the state falls sick, and is at war with\\nherself; and may be at times distracted, even when there is no external\\ncause.\\n\\nyes, surely.\\n\\nand then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their\\nopponents, slaughtering some and banishing some, while to the remainder\\nthey give an equal share of freedom and power; and this is the form of\\ngovernment in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot.\\n\\nyes, he said, that is the nature of democracy, whether the revolution\\nhas been effected by arms, or whether fear has caused the opposite\\nparty to withdraw.\\n\\nand now what is their manner of life, and what sort of a government\\nhave they? for as the government is, such will be the man.\\n\\nclearly, he said.\\n\\nin the first place, are they not free; and is not the city full of\\nfreedom and frankness—a man may say and do what he likes?\\n\\n’tis said so, he replied.\\n\\nand where freedom is, the individual is clearly able to order for\\nhimself his own life as he pleases?\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nthen in this kind of state there will be the greatest variety of human\\nnatures?\\n\\nthere will.\\n\\nthis, then, seems likely to be the fairest of states, being like an\\nembroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower. and just\\nas women and children think a variety of colours to be of all things\\nmost charming, so there are many men to whom this state, which is\\nspangled with the manners and characters of mankind, will appear to be\\nthe fairest of states.\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nyes, my good sir, and there will be no better in which to look for a\\ngovernment.\\n\\nwhy?\\n\\nbecause of the liberty which reigns there—they have a complete\\nassortment of constitutions; and he who has a mind to establish a\\nstate, as we have been doing, must go to a democracy as he would to a\\nbazaar at which they sell them, and pick out the one that suits him;\\nthen, when he has made his choice, he may found his state.\\n\\nhe will be sure to have patterns enough.\\n\\nand there being no necessity, i said, for you to govern in this state,\\neven if you have the capacity, or to be governed, unless you like, or\\ngo to war when the rest go to war, or to be at peace when others are at\\npeace, unless you are so disposed—there being no necessity also,\\nbecause some law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast, that you\\nshould not hold office or be a dicast, if you have a fancy—is not this\\na way of life which for the moment is supremely delightful?\\n\\nfor the moment, yes.\\n\\nand is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite\\ncharming? have you not observed how, in a democracy, many persons,\\nalthough they have been sentenced to death or exile, just stay where\\nthey are and walk about the world—the gentleman parades like a hero,\\nand nobody sees or cares?\\n\\nyes, he replied, many and many a one.\\n\\nsee too, i said, the forgiving spirit of democracy, and the ‘don’t\\ncare’ about trifles, and the disregard which she shows of all the fine\\nprinciples which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the city—as\\nwhen we said that, except in the case of some rarely gifted nature,\\nthere never will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used\\nto play amid things of beauty and make of them a joy and a study—how\\ngrandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet,\\nnever giving a thought to the pursuits which make a statesman, and\\npromoting to honour any one who professes to be the people’s friend.\\n\\nyes, she is of a noble spirit.\\n\\nthese and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy, which\\nis a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and\\ndispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike.\\n\\nwe know her well.\\n\\nconsider now, i said, what manner of man the individual is, or rather\\nconsider, as in the case of the state, how he comes into being.\\n\\nvery good, he said.\\n\\nis not this the way—he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical\\nfather who has trained him in his own habits?\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nand, like his father, he keeps under by force the pleasures which are\\nof the spending and not of the getting sort, being those which are\\ncalled unnecessary?\\n\\nobviously.\\n\\nwould you like, for the sake of clearness, to distinguish which are the\\nnecessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures?\\n\\ni should.\\n\\nare not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid, and of\\nwhich the satisfaction is a benefit to us? and they are rightly called\\nso, because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial\\nand what is necessary, and cannot help it.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nwe are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?\\n\\nwe are not.\\n\\nand the desires of which a man may get rid, if he takes pains from his\\nyouth upwards—of which the presence, moreover, does no good, and in\\nsome cases the reverse of good—shall we not be right in saying that all\\nthese are unnecessary?\\n\\nyes, certainly.\\n\\nsuppose we select an example of either kind, in order that we may have\\na general notion of them?\\n\\nvery good.\\n\\nwill not the desire of eating, that is, of simple food and condiments,\\nin so far as they are required for health and strength, be of the\\nnecessary class?\\n\\nthat is what i should suppose.\\n\\nthe pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways; it does us good and it\\nis essential to the continuance of life?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nbut the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for\\nhealth?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand the desire which goes beyond this, of more delicate food, or other\\nluxuries, which might generally be got rid of, if controlled and\\ntrained in youth, and is hurtful to the body, and hurtful to the soul\\nin the pursuit of wisdom and virtue, may be rightly called unnecessary?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nmay we not say that these desires spend, and that the others make money\\nbecause they conduce to production?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds\\ngood?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures\\nand desires of this sort, and was the slave of the unnecessary desires,\\nwhereas he who was subject to the necessary only was miserly and\\noligarchical?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nagain, let us see how the democratical man grows out of the\\noligarchical: the following, as i suspect, is commonly the process.\\n\\nwhat is the process?\\n\\nwhen a young man who has been brought up as we were just now\\ndescribing, in a vulgar and miserly way, has tasted drones’ honey and\\nhas come to associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to\\nprovide for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of\\npleasure—then, as you may imagine, the change will begin of the\\noligarchical principle within him into the democratical?\\n\\ninevitably.\\n\\nand as in the city like was helping like, and the change was effected\\nby an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens, so\\ntoo the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without\\nto assist the desires within him, that which is akin and alike again\\nhelping that which is akin and alike?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within\\nhim, whether the influence of a father or of kindred, advising or\\nrebuking him, then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite\\nfaction, and he goes to war with himself.\\n\\nit must be so.\\n\\nand there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the\\noligarchical, and some of his desires die, and others are banished; a\\nspirit of reverence enters into the young man’s soul and order is\\nrestored.\\n\\nyes, he said, that sometimes happens.\\n\\nand then, again, after the old desires have been driven out, fresh ones\\nspring up, which are akin to them, and because he their father does not\\nknow how to educate them, wax fierce and numerous.\\n\\nyes, he said, that is apt to be the way.\\n\\nthey draw him to his old associates, and holding secret intercourse\\nwith them, breed and multiply in him.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nat length they seize upon the citadel of the young man’s soul, which\\nthey perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and\\ntrue words, which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to\\nthe gods, and are their best guardians and sentinels.\\n\\nnone better.\\n\\nfalse and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their\\nplace.\\n\\nthey are certain to do so.\\n\\nand so the young man returns into the country of the lotus-eaters, and\\ntakes up his dwelling there in the face of all men; and if any help be\\nsent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him, the aforesaid vain\\nconceits shut the gate of the king’s fastness; and they will neither\\nallow the embassy itself to enter, nor if private advisers offer the\\nfatherly counsel of the aged will they listen to them or receive them.\\nthere is a battle and they gain the day, and then modesty, which they\\ncall silliness, is ignominiously thrust into exile by them, and\\ntemperance, which they nickname unmanliness, is trampled in the mire\\nand cast forth; they persuade men that moderation and orderly\\nexpenditure are vulgarity and meanness, and so, by the help of a rabble\\nof evil appetites, they drive them beyond the border.\\n\\nyes, with a will.\\n\\nand when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is now\\nin their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries,\\nthe next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy\\nand waste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads,\\nand a great company with them, hymning their praises and calling them\\nby sweet names; insolence they term breeding, and anarchy liberty, and\\nwaste magnificence, and impudence courage. and so the young man passes\\nout of his original nature, which was trained in the school of\\nnecessity, into the freedom and libertinism of useless and unnecessary\\npleasures.\\n\\nyes, he said, the change in him is visible enough.\\n\\nafter this he lives on, spending his money and labour and time on\\nunnecessary pleasures quite as much as on necessary ones; but if he be\\nfortunate, and is not too much disordered in his wits, when years have\\nelapsed, and the heyday of passion is over—supposing that he then\\nre-admits into the city some part of the exiled virtues, and does not\\nwholly give himself up to their successors—in that case he balances his\\npleasures and lives in a sort of equilibrium, putting the government of\\nhimself into the hands of the one which comes first and wins the turn;\\nand when he has had enough of that, then into the hands of another; he\\ndespises none of them but encourages them all equally.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nneither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of\\nadvice; if any one says to him that some pleasures are the\\nsatisfactions of good and noble desires, and others of evil desires,\\nand that he ought to use and honour some and chastise and master the\\nothers—whenever this is repeated to him he shakes his head and says\\nthat they are all alike, and that one is as good as another.\\n\\nyes, he said; that is the way with him.\\n\\nyes, i said, he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the\\nhour; and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute;\\nthen he becomes a water-drinker, and tries to get thin; then he takes a\\nturn at gymnastics; sometimes idling and neglecting everything, then\\nonce more living the life of a philosopher; often he is busy with\\npolitics, and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into\\nhis head; and, if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior, off he is\\nin that direction, or of men of business, once more in that. his life\\nhas neither law nor order; and this distracted existence he terms joy\\nand bliss and freedom; and so he goes on.\\n\\nyes, he replied, he is all liberty and equality.\\n\\nyes, i said; his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the\\nlives of many;—he answers to the state which we described as fair and\\nspangled. and many a man and many a woman will take him for their\\npattern, and many a constitution and many an example of manners is\\ncontained in him.\\n\\njust so.\\n\\nlet him then be set over against democracy; he may truly be called the\\ndemocratic man.\\n\\nlet that be his place, he said.\\n\\nlast of all comes the most beautiful of all, man and state alike,\\ntyranny and the tyrant; these we have now to consider.\\n\\nquite true, he said.\\n\\nsay then, my friend, in what manner does tyranny arise?—that it has a\\ndemocratic origin is evident.\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nand does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as\\ndemocracy from oligarchy—i mean, after a sort?\\n\\nhow?\\n\\nthe good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it\\nwas maintained was excess of wealth—am i not right?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things\\nfor the sake of money-getting was also the ruin of oligarchy?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire brings\\nher to dissolution?\\n\\nwhat good?\\n\\nfreedom, i replied; which, as they tell you in a democracy, is the\\nglory of the state—and that therefore in a democracy alone will the\\nfreeman of nature deign to dwell.\\n\\nyes; the saying is in every body’s mouth.\\n\\ni was going to observe, that the insatiable desire of this and the\\nneglect of other things introduces the change in democracy, which\\noccasions a demand for tyranny.\\n\\nhow so?\\n\\nwhen a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cup-bearers\\npresiding over the feast, and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine\\nof freedom, then, unless her rulers are very amenable and give a\\nplentiful draught, she calls them to account and punishes them, and\\nsays that they are cursed oligarchs.\\n\\nyes, he replied, a very common occurrence.\\n\\nyes, i said; and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves\\nwho hug their chains and men of naught; she would have subjects who are\\nlike rulers, and rulers who are like subjects: these are men after her\\nown heart, whom she praises and honours both in private and public.\\nnow, in such a state, can liberty have any limit?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nby degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses, and ends by\\ngetting among the animals and infecting them.\\n\\nhow do you mean?\\n\\ni mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his\\nsons and to fear them, and the son is on a level with his father, he\\nhaving no respect or reverence for either of his parents; and this is\\nhis freedom, and the metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen\\nwith the metic, and the stranger is quite as good as either.\\n\\nyes, he said, that is the way.\\n\\nand these are not the only evils, i said—there are several lesser ones:\\nin such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars,\\nand the scholars despise their masters and tutors; young and old are\\nall alike; and the young man is on a level with the old, and is ready\\nto compete with him in word or deed; and old men condescend to the\\nyoung and are full of pleasantry and gaiety; they are loth to be\\nthought morose and authoritative, and therefore they adopt the manners\\nof the young.\\n\\nquite true, he said.\\n\\nthe last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with\\nmoney, whether male or female, is just as free as his or her purchaser;\\nnor must i forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes\\nin relation to each other.\\n\\nwhy not, as aeschylus says, utter the word which rises to our lips?\\n\\nthat is what i am doing, i replied; and i must add that no one who does\\nnot know would believe, how much greater is the liberty which the\\nanimals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in\\nany other state: for truly, the she-dogs, as the proverb says, are as\\ngood as their she-mistresses, and the horses and asses have a way of\\nmarching along with all the rights and dignities of freemen; and they\\nwill run at any body who comes in their way if he does not leave the\\nroad clear for them: and all things are just ready to burst with\\nliberty.\\n\\nwhen i take a country walk, he said, i often experience what you\\ndescribe. you and i have dreamed the same thing.\\n\\nand above all, i said, and as the result of all, see how sensitive the\\ncitizens become; they chafe impatiently at the least touch of\\nauthority, and at length, as you know, they cease to care even for the\\nlaws, written or unwritten; they will have no one over them.\\n\\nyes, he said, i know it too well.\\n\\nsuch, my friend, i said, is the fair and glorious beginning out of\\nwhich springs tyranny.\\n\\nglorious indeed, he said. but what is the next step?\\n\\nthe ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same disease\\nmagnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy—the truth\\nbeing that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction\\nin the opposite direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons\\nand in vegetable and animal life, but above all in forms of government.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthe excess of liberty, whether in states or individuals, seems only to\\npass into excess of slavery.\\n\\nyes, the natural order.\\n\\nand so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most\\naggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of\\nliberty?\\n\\nas we might expect.\\n\\nthat, however, was not, as i believe, your question—you rather desired\\nto know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and\\ndemocracy, and is the ruin of both?\\n\\njust so, he replied.\\n\\nwell, i said, i meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts, of\\nwhom the more courageous are the leaders and the more timid the\\nfollowers, the same whom we were comparing to drones, some stingless,\\nand others having stings.\\n\\na very just comparison.\\n\\nthese two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are\\ngenerated, being what phlegm and bile are to the body. and the good\\nphysician and lawgiver of the state ought, like the wise bee-master, to\\nkeep them at a distance and prevent, if possible, their ever coming in;\\nand if they have anyhow found a way in, then he should have them and\\ntheir cells cut out as speedily as possible.\\n\\nyes, by all means, he said.\\n\\nthen, in order that we may see clearly what we are doing, let us\\nimagine democracy to be divided, as indeed it is, into three classes;\\nfor in the first place freedom creates rather more drones in the\\ndemocratic than there were in the oligarchical state.\\n\\nthat is true.\\n\\nand in the democracy they are certainly more intensified.\\n\\nhow so?\\n\\nbecause in the oligarchical state they are disqualified and driven from\\noffice, and therefore they cannot train or gather strength; whereas in\\na democracy they are almost the entire ruling power, and while the\\nkeener sort speak and act, the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do\\nnot suffer a word to be said on the other side; hence in democracies\\nalmost everything is managed by the drones.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nthen there is another class which is always being severed from the\\nmass.\\n\\nwhat is that?\\n\\nthey are the orderly class, which in a nation of traders is sure to be\\nthe richest.\\n\\nnaturally so.\\n\\nthey are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of\\nhoney to the drones.\\n\\nwhy, he said, there is little to be squeezed out of people who have\\nlittle.\\n\\nand this is called the wealthy class, and the drones feed upon them.\\n\\nthat is pretty much the case, he said.\\n\\nthe people are a third class, consisting of those who work with their\\nown hands; they are not politicians, and have not much to live upon.\\nthis, when assembled, is the largest and most powerful class in a\\ndemocracy.\\n\\ntrue, he said; but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate\\nunless they get a little honey.\\n\\nand do they not share? i said. do not their leaders deprive the rich of\\ntheir estates and distribute them among the people; at the same time\\ntaking care to reserve the larger part for themselves?\\n\\nwhy, yes, he said, to that extent the people do share.\\n\\nand the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to\\ndefend themselves before the people as they best can?\\n\\nwhat else can they do?\\n\\nand then, although they may have no desire of change, the others charge\\nthem with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand the end is that when they see the people, not of their own accord,\\nbut through ignorance, and because they are deceived by informers,\\nseeking to do them wrong, then at last they are forced to become\\noligarchs in reality; they do not wish to be, but the sting of the\\ndrones torments them and breeds revolution in them.\\n\\nthat is exactly the truth.\\n\\nthen come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthe people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse\\ninto greatness.\\n\\nyes, that is their way.\\n\\nthis and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he\\nfirst appears above ground he is a protector.\\n\\nyes, that is quite clear.\\n\\nhow then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant? clearly when\\nhe does what the man is said to do in the tale of the arcadian temple\\nof lycaean zeus.\\n\\nwhat tale?\\n\\nthe tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human\\nvictim minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to\\nbecome a wolf. did you never hear it?\\n\\noh, yes.\\n\\nand the protector of the people is like him; having a mob entirely at\\nhis disposal, he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen;\\nby the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court\\nand murders them, making the life of man to disappear, and with unholy\\ntongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizens; some he kills\\nand others he banishes, at the same time hinting at the abolition of\\ndebts and partition of lands: and after this, what will be his destiny?\\nmust he not either perish at the hands of his enemies, or from being a\\nman become a wolf—that is, a tyrant?\\n\\ninevitably.\\n\\nthis, i said, is he who begins to make a party against the rich?\\n\\nthe same.\\n\\nafter a while he is driven out, but comes back, in spite of his\\nenemies, a tyrant full grown.\\n\\nthat is clear.\\n\\nand if they are unable to expel him, or to get him condemned to death\\nby a public accusation, they conspire to assassinate him.\\n\\nyes, he said, that is their usual way.\\n\\nthen comes the famous request for a body-guard, which is the device of\\nall those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career—‘let not the\\npeople’s friend,’ as they say, ‘be lost to them.’\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nthe people readily assent; all their fears are for him—they have none\\nfor themselves.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy of\\nthe people sees this, then, my friend, as the oracle said to croesus,\\n\\n‘by pebbly hermus’ shore he flees and rests not, and is not ashamed to\\nbe a coward.’\\n\\nand quite right too, said he, for if he were, he would never be ashamed\\nagain.\\n\\nbut if he is caught he dies.\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nand he, the protector of whom we spoke, is to be seen, not ‘larding the\\nplain’ with his bulk, but himself the overthrower of many, standing up\\nin the chariot of state with the reins in his hand, no longer\\nprotector, but tyrant absolute.\\n\\nno doubt, he said.\\n\\nand now let us consider the happiness of the man, and also of the state\\nin which a creature like him is generated.\\n\\nyes, he said, let us consider that.\\n\\nat first, in the early days of his power, he is full of smiles, and he\\nsalutes every one whom he meets;—he to be called a tyrant, who is\\nmaking promises in public and also in private! liberating debtors, and\\ndistributing land to the people and his followers, and wanting to be so\\nkind and good to every one!\\n\\nof course, he said.\\n\\nbut when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty, and\\nthere is nothing to fear from them, then he is always stirring up some\\nwar or other, in order that the people may require a leader.\\n\\nto be sure.\\n\\nhas he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished\\nby payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their\\ndaily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him?\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nand if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom,\\nand of resistance to his authority, he will have a good pretext for\\ndestroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy; and for all\\nthese reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war.\\n\\nhe must.\\n\\nnow he begins to grow unpopular.\\n\\na necessary result.\\n\\nthen some of those who joined in setting him up, and who are in power,\\nspeak their minds to him and to one another, and the more courageous of\\nthem cast in his teeth what is being done.\\n\\nyes, that may be expected.\\n\\nand the tyrant, if he means to rule, must get rid of them; he cannot\\nstop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything.\\n\\nhe cannot.\\n\\nand therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant, who is\\nhigh-minded, who is wise, who is wealthy; happy man, he is the enemy of\\nthem all, and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no,\\nuntil he has made a purgation of the state.\\n\\nyes, he said, and a rare purgation.\\n\\nyes, i said, not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of the\\nbody; for they take away the worse and leave the better part, but he\\ndoes the reverse.\\n\\nif he is to rule, i suppose that he cannot help himself.\\n\\nwhat a blessed alternative, i said:—to be compelled to dwell only with\\nthe many bad, and to be by them hated, or not to live at all!\\n\\nyes, that is the alternative.\\n\\nand the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more\\nsatellites and the greater devotion in them will he require?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand who are the devoted band, and where will he procure them?\\n\\nthey will flock to him, he said, of their own accord, if he pays them.\\n\\nby the dog! i said, here are more drones, of every sort and from every\\nland.\\n\\nyes, he said, there are.\\n\\nbut will he not desire to get them on the spot?\\n\\nhow do you mean?\\n\\nhe will rob the citizens of their slaves; he will then set them free\\nand enrol them in his body-guard.\\n\\nto be sure, he said; and he will be able to trust them best of all.\\n\\nwhat a blessed creature, i said, must this tyrant be; he has put to\\ndeath the others and has these for his trusted friends.\\n\\nyes, he said; they are quite of his sort.\\n\\nyes, i said, and these are the new citizens whom he has called into\\nexistence, who admire him and are his companions, while the good hate\\nand avoid him.\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nverily, then, tragedy is a wise thing and euripides a great tragedian.\\n\\nwhy so?\\n\\nwhy, because he is the author of the pregnant saying,\\n\\n‘tyrants are wise by living with the wise;’\\n\\nand he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant\\nmakes his companions.\\n\\nyes, he said, and he also praises tyranny as godlike; and many other\\nthings of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets.\\n\\nand therefore, i said, the tragic poets being wise men will forgive us\\nand any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into\\nour state, because they are the eulogists of tyranny.\\n\\nyes, he said, those who have the wit will doubtless forgive us.\\n\\nbut they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs, and hire\\nvoices fair and loud and persuasive, and draw the cities over to\\ntyrannies and democracies.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nmoreover, they are paid for this and receive honour—the greatest\\nhonour, as might be expected, from tyrants, and the next greatest from\\ndemocracies; but the higher they ascend our constitution hill, the more\\ntheir reputation fails, and seems unable from shortness of breath to\\nproceed further.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nbut we are wandering from the subject: let us therefore return and\\nenquire how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various\\nand ever-changing army of his.\\n\\nif, he said, there are sacred treasures in the city, he will confiscate\\nand spend them; and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons may\\nsuffice, he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise\\nhave to impose upon the people.\\n\\nand when these fail?\\n\\nwhy, clearly, he said, then he and his boon companions, whether male or\\nfemale, will be maintained out of his father’s estate.\\n\\nyou mean to say that the people, from whom he has derived his being,\\nwill maintain him and his companions?\\n\\nyes, he said; they cannot help themselves.\\n\\nbut what if the people fly into a passion, and aver that a grown-up son\\nought not to be supported by his father, but that the father should be\\nsupported by the son? the father did not bring him into being, or\\nsettle him in life, in order that when his son became a man he should\\nhimself be the servant of his own servants and should support him and\\nhis rabble of slaves and companions; but that his son should protect\\nhim, and that by his help he might be emancipated from the government\\nof the rich and aristocratic, as they are termed. and so he bids him\\nand his companions depart, just as any other father might drive out of\\nthe house a riotous son and his undesirable associates.\\n\\nby heaven, he said, then the parent will discover what a monster he has\\nbeen fostering in his bosom; and, when he wants to drive him out, he\\nwill find that he is weak and his son strong.\\n\\nwhy, you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence? what!\\nbeat his father if he opposes him?\\n\\nyes, he will, having first disarmed him.\\n\\nthen he is a parricide, and a cruel guardian of an aged parent; and\\nthis is real tyranny, about which there can be no longer a mistake: as\\nthe saying is, the people who would escape the smoke which is the\\nslavery of freemen, has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of\\nslaves. thus liberty, getting out of all order and reason, passes into\\nthe harshest and bitterest form of slavery.\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nvery well; and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently\\ndiscussed the nature of tyranny, and the manner of the transition from\\ndemocracy to tyranny?\\n\\nyes, quite enough, he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book ix.\\n\\n\\nlast of all comes the tyrannical man; about whom we have once more to\\nask, how is he formed out of the democratical? and how does he live, in\\nhappiness or in misery?\\n\\nyes, he said, he is the only one remaining.\\n\\nthere is, however, i said, a previous question which remains\\nunanswered.\\n\\nwhat question?\\n\\ni do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number\\nof the appetites, and until this is accomplished the enquiry will\\nalways be confused.\\n\\nwell, he said, it is not too late to supply the omission.\\n\\nvery true, i said; and observe the point which i want to understand:\\ncertain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites i conceive to be\\nunlawful; every one appears to have them, but in some persons they are\\ncontrolled by the laws and by reason, and the better desires prevail\\nover them—either they are wholly banished or they become few and weak;\\nwhile in the case of others they are stronger, and there are more of\\nthem.\\n\\nwhich appetites do you mean?\\n\\ni mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling\\npower is asleep; then the wild beast within us, gorged with meat or\\ndrink, starts up and having shaken off sleep, goes forth to satisfy his\\ndesires; and there is no conceivable folly or crime—not excepting\\nincest or any other unnatural union, or parricide, or the eating of\\nforbidden food—which at such a time, when he has parted company with\\nall shame and sense, a man may not be ready to commit.\\n\\nmost true, he said.\\n\\nbut when a man’s pulse is healthy and temperate, and when before going\\nto sleep he has awakened his rational powers, and fed them on noble\\nthoughts and enquiries, collecting himself in meditation; after having\\nfirst indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little, but just\\nenough to lay them to sleep, and prevent them and their enjoyments and\\npains from interfering with the higher principle—which he leaves in the\\nsolitude of pure abstraction, free to contemplate and aspire to the\\nknowledge of the unknown, whether in past, present, or future: when\\nagain he has allayed the passionate element, if he has a quarrel\\nagainst any one—i say, when, after pacifying the two irrational\\nprinciples, he rouses up the third, which is reason, before he takes\\nhis rest, then, as you know, he attains truth most nearly, and is least\\nlikely to be the sport of fantastic and lawless visions.\\n\\ni quite agree.\\n\\nin saying this i have been running into a digression; but the point\\nwhich i desire to note is that in all of us, even in good men, there is\\na lawless wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep. pray, consider\\nwhether i am right, and you agree with me.\\n\\nyes, i agree.\\n\\nand now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic\\nman. he was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under\\na miserly parent, who encouraged the saving appetites in him, but\\ndiscountenanced the unnecessary, which aim only at amusement and\\nornament?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand then he got into the company of a more refined, licentious sort of\\npeople, and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite\\nextreme from an abhorrence of his father’s meanness. at last, being a\\nbetter man than his corruptors, he was drawn in both directions until\\nhe halted midway and led a life, not of vulgar and slavish passion, but\\nof what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures. after this\\nmanner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch?\\n\\nyes, he said; that was our view of him, and is so still.\\n\\nand now, i said, years will have passed away, and you must conceive\\nthis man, such as he is, to have a son, who is brought up in his\\nfather’s principles.\\n\\ni can imagine him.\\n\\nthen you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which\\nhas already happened to the father:—he is drawn into a perfectly\\nlawless life, which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty; and his\\nfather and friends take part with his moderate desires, and the\\nopposite party assist the opposite ones. as soon as these dire\\nmagicians and tyrant-makers find that they are losing their hold on\\nhim, they contrive to implant in him a master passion, to be lord over\\nhis idle and spendthrift lusts—a sort of monstrous winged drone—that is\\nthe only image which will adequately describe him.\\n\\nyes, he said, that is the only adequate image of him.\\n\\nand when his other lusts, amid clouds of incense and perfumes and\\ngarlands and wines, and all the pleasures of a dissolute life, now let\\nloose, come buzzing around him, nourishing to the utmost the sting of\\ndesire which they implant in his drone-like nature, then at last this\\nlord of the soul, having madness for the captain of his guard, breaks\\nout into a frenzy: and if he finds in himself any good opinions or\\nappetites in process of formation, and there is in him any sense of\\nshame remaining, to these better principles he puts an end, and casts\\nthem forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness\\nto the full.\\n\\nyes, he said, that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated.\\n\\nand is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?\\n\\ni should not wonder.\\n\\nfurther, i said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?\\n\\nhe has.\\n\\nand you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind, will\\nfancy that he is able to rule, not only over men, but also over the\\ngods?\\n\\nthat he will.\\n\\nand the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being\\nwhen, either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he\\nbecomes drunken, lustful, passionate? o my friend, is not that so?\\n\\nassuredly.\\n\\nsuch is the man and such is his origin. and next, how does he live?\\n\\nsuppose, as people facetiously say, you were to tell me.\\n\\ni imagine, i said, at the next step in his progress, that there will be\\nfeasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans, and all that sort\\nof thing; love is the lord of the house within him, and orders all the\\nconcerns of his soul.\\n\\nthat is certain.\\n\\nyes; and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable,\\nand their demands are many.\\n\\nthey are indeed, he said.\\n\\nhis revenues, if he has any, are soon spent.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthen comes debt and the cutting down of his property.\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nwhen he has nothing left, must not his desires, crowding in the nest\\nlike young ravens, be crying aloud for food; and he, goaded on by them,\\nand especially by love himself, who is in a manner the captain of them,\\nis in a frenzy, and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil\\nof his property, in order that he may gratify them?\\n\\nyes, that is sure to be the case.\\n\\nhe must have money, no matter how, if he is to escape horrid pains and\\npangs.\\n\\nhe must.\\n\\nand as in himself there was a succession of pleasures, and the new got\\nthe better of the old and took away their rights, so he being younger\\nwill claim to have more than his father and his mother, and if he has\\nspent his own share of the property, he will take a slice of theirs.\\n\\nno doubt he will.\\n\\nand if his parents will not give way, then he will try first of all to\\ncheat and deceive them.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand if he fails, then he will use force and plunder them.\\n\\nyes, probably.\\n\\nand if the old man and woman fight for their own, what then, my friend?\\nwill the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them?\\n\\nnay, he said, i should not feel at all comfortable about his parents.\\n\\nbut, o heavens! adeimantus, on account of some new-fangled love of a\\nharlot, who is anything but a necessary connection, can you believe\\nthat he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary\\nto his very existence, and would place her under the authority of the\\nother, when she is brought under the same roof with her; or that, under\\nlike circumstances, he would do the same to his withered old father,\\nfirst and most indispensable of friends, for the sake of some\\nnewly-found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable?\\n\\nyes, indeed, he said; i believe that he would.\\n\\ntruly, then, i said, a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and\\nmother.\\n\\nhe is indeed, he replied.\\n\\nhe first takes their property, and when that fails, and pleasures are\\nbeginning to swarm in the hive of his soul, then he breaks into a\\nhouse, or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer; next he\\nproceeds to clear a temple. meanwhile the old opinions which he had\\nwhen a child, and which gave judgment about good and evil, are\\noverthrown by those others which have just been emancipated, and are\\nnow the body-guard of love and share his empire. these in his\\ndemocratic days, when he was still subject to the laws and to his\\nfather, were only let loose in the dreams of sleep. but now that he is\\nunder the dominion of love, he becomes always and in waking reality\\nwhat he was then very rarely and in a dream only; he will commit the\\nfoulest murder, or eat forbidden food, or be guilty of any other horrid\\nact. love is his tyrant, and lives lordly in him and lawlessly, and\\nbeing himself a king, leads him on, as a tyrant leads a state, to the\\nperformance of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and\\nthe rabble of his associates, whether those whom evil communications\\nhave brought in from without, or those whom he himself has allowed to\\nbreak loose within him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself.\\nhave we not here a picture of his way of life?\\n\\nyes, indeed, he said.\\n\\nand if there are only a few of them in the state, and the rest of the\\npeople are well disposed, they go away and become the body-guard or\\nmercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them for\\na war; and if there is no war, they stay at home and do many little\\npieces of mischief in the city.\\n\\nwhat sort of mischief?\\n\\nfor example, they are the thieves, burglars, cut-purses, foot-pads,\\nrobbers of temples, man-stealers of the community; or if they are able\\nto speak they turn informers, and bear false witness, and take bribes.\\n\\na small catalogue of evils, even if the perpetrators of them are few in\\nnumber.\\n\\nyes, i said; but small and great are comparative terms, and all these\\nthings, in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a state, do not\\ncome within a thousand miles of the tyrant; when this noxious class and\\ntheir followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength,\\nassisted by the infatuation of the people, they choose from among\\nthemselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul, and him\\nthey create their tyrant.\\n\\nyes, he said, and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant.\\n\\nif the people yield, well and good; but if they resist him, as he began\\nby beating his own father and mother, so now, if he has the power, he\\nbeats them, and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland, as the\\ncretans say, in subjection to his young retainers whom he has\\nintroduced to be their rulers and masters. this is the end of his\\npassions and desires.\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nwhen such men are only private individuals and before they get power,\\nthis is their character; they associate entirely with their own\\nflatterers or ready tools; or if they want anything from anybody, they\\nin their turn are equally ready to bow down before them: they profess\\nevery sort of affection for them; but when they have gained their point\\nthey know them no more.\\n\\nyes, truly.\\n\\nthey are always either the masters or servants and never the friends of\\nanybody; the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship.\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nand may we not rightly call such men treacherous?\\n\\nno question.\\n\\nalso they are utterly unjust, if we were right in our notion of\\njustice?\\n\\nyes, he said, and we were perfectly right.\\n\\nlet us then sum up in a word, i said, the character of the worst man:\\nhe is the waking reality of what we dreamed.\\n\\nmost true.\\n\\nand this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule, and the\\nlonger he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes.\\n\\nthat is certain, said glaucon, taking his turn to answer.\\n\\nand will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest, be also the\\nmost miserable? and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most\\ncontinually and truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion\\nof men in general?\\n\\nyes, he said, inevitably.\\n\\nand must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical state, and the\\ndemocratical man like the democratical state; and the same of the\\nothers?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand as state is to state in virtue and happiness, so is man in relation\\nto man?\\n\\nto be sure.\\n\\nthen comparing our original city, which was under a king, and the city\\nwhich is under a tyrant, how do they stand as to virtue?\\n\\nthey are the opposite extremes, he said, for one is the very best and\\nthe other is the very worst.\\n\\nthere can be no mistake, i said, as to which is which, and therefore i\\nwill at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision\\nabout their relative happiness and misery. and here we must not allow\\nourselves to be panic-stricken at the apparition of the tyrant, who is\\nonly a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him; but let us\\ngo as we ought into every corner of the city and look all about, and\\nthen we will give our opinion.\\n\\na fair invitation, he replied; and i see, as every one must, that a\\ntyranny is the wretchedest form of government, and the rule of a king\\nthe happiest.\\n\\nand in estimating the men too, may i not fairly make a like request,\\nthat i should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through\\nhuman nature? he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and\\nis dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to\\nthe beholder, but let him be one who has a clear insight. may i suppose\\nthat the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able\\nto judge, and has dwelt in the same place with him, and been present at\\nhis dally life and known him in his family relations, where he may be\\nseen stripped of his tragedy attire, and again in the hour of public\\ndanger—he shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant\\nwhen compared with other men?\\n\\nthat again, he said, is a very fair proposal.\\n\\nshall i assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and\\nhave before now met with such a person? we shall then have some one who\\nwill answer our enquiries.\\n\\nby all means.\\n\\nlet me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the\\nstate; bearing this in mind, and glancing in turn from one to the other\\nof them, will you tell me their respective conditions?\\n\\nwhat do you mean? he asked.\\n\\nbeginning with the state, i replied, would you say that a city which is\\ngoverned by a tyrant is free or enslaved?\\n\\nno city, he said, can be more completely enslaved.\\n\\nand yet, as you see, there are freemen as well as masters in such a\\nstate?\\n\\nyes, he said, i see that there are—a few; but the people, speaking\\ngenerally, and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved.\\n\\nthen if the man is like the state, i said, must not the same rule\\nprevail? his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity—the best elements\\nin him are enslaved; and there is a small ruling part, which is also\\nthe worst and maddest.\\n\\ninevitably.\\n\\nand would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a\\nfreeman, or of a slave?\\n\\nhe has the soul of a slave, in my opinion.\\n\\nand the state which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of\\nacting voluntarily?\\n\\nutterly incapable.\\n\\nand also the soul which is under a tyrant (i am speaking of the soul\\ntaken as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires; there is\\na gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and remorse?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?\\n\\npoor.\\n\\nand the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand must not such a state and such a man be always full of fear?\\n\\nyes, indeed.\\n\\nis there any state in which you will find more of lamentation and\\nsorrow and groaning and pain?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nand is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery\\nthan in the tyrannical man, who is in a fury of passions and desires?\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nreflecting upon these and similar evils, you held the tyrannical state\\nto be the most miserable of states?\\n\\nand i was right, he said.\\n\\ncertainly, i said. and when you see the same evils in the tyrannical\\nman, what do you say of him?\\n\\ni say that he is by far the most miserable of all men.\\n\\nthere, i said, i think that you are beginning to go wrong.\\n\\nwhat do you mean?\\n\\ni do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery.\\n\\nthen who is more miserable?\\n\\none of whom i am about to speak.\\n\\nwho is that?\\n\\nhe who is of a tyrannical nature, and instead of leading a private life\\nhas been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant.\\n\\nfrom what has been said, i gather that you are right.\\n\\nyes, i replied, but in this high argument you should be a little more\\ncertain, and should not conjecture only; for of all questions, this\\nrespecting good and evil is the greatest.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nlet me then offer you an illustration, which may, i think, throw a\\nlight upon this subject.\\n\\nwhat is your illustration?\\n\\nthe case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves: from\\nthem you may form an idea of the tyrant’s condition, for they both have\\nslaves; the only difference is that he has more slaves.\\n\\nyes, that is the difference.\\n\\nyou know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from\\ntheir servants?\\n\\nwhat should they fear?\\n\\nnothing. but do you observe the reason of this?\\n\\nyes; the reason is, that the whole city is leagued together for the\\nprotection of each individual.\\n\\nvery true, i said. but imagine one of these owners, the master say of\\nsome fifty slaves, together with his family and property and slaves,\\ncarried off by a god into the wilderness, where there are no freemen to\\nhelp him—will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and\\nchildren should be put to death by his slaves?\\n\\nyes, he said, he will be in the utmost fear.\\n\\nthe time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of his\\nslaves, and make many promises to them of freedom and other things,\\nmuch against his will—he will have to cajole his own servants.\\n\\nyes, he said, that will be the only way of saving himself.\\n\\nand suppose the same god, who carried him away, to surround him with\\nneighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another, and\\nwho, if they could catch the offender, would take his life?\\n\\nhis case will be still worse, if you suppose him to be everywhere\\nsurrounded and watched by enemies.\\n\\nand is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound—he\\nwho being by nature such as we have described, is full of all sorts of\\nfears and lusts? his soul is dainty and greedy, and yet alone, of all\\nmen in the city, he is never allowed to go on a journey, or to see the\\nthings which other freemen desire to see, but he lives in his hole like\\na woman hidden in the house, and is jealous of any other citizen who\\ngoes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nand amid evils such as these will not he who is ill-governed in his own\\nperson—the tyrannical man, i mean—whom you just now decided to be the\\nmost miserable of all—will not he be yet more miserable when, instead\\nof leading a private life, he is constrained by fortune to be a public\\ntyrant? he has to be master of others when he is not master of himself:\\nhe is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his\\nlife, not in retirement, but fighting and combating with other men.\\n\\nyes, he said, the similitude is most exact.\\n\\nis not his case utterly miserable? and does not the actual tyrant lead\\na worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nhe who is the real tyrant, whatever men may think, is the real slave,\\nand is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility, and to\\nbe the flatterer of the vilest of mankind. he has desires which he is\\nutterly unable to satisfy, and has more wants than any one, and is\\ntruly poor, if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him: all his\\nlife long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions and\\ndistractions, even as the state which he resembles: and surely the\\nresemblance holds?\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nmoreover, as we were saying before, he grows worse from having power:\\nhe becomes and is of necessity more jealous, more faithless, more\\nunjust, more friendless, more impious, than he was at first; he is the\\npurveyor and cherisher of every sort of vice, and the consequence is\\nthat he is supremely miserable, and that he makes everybody else as\\nmiserable as himself.\\n\\nno man of any sense will dispute your words.\\n\\ncome then, i said, and as the general umpire in theatrical contests\\nproclaims the result, do you also decide who in your opinion is first\\nin the scale of happiness, and who second, and in what order the others\\nfollow: there are five of them in all—they are the royal, timocratical,\\noligarchical, democratical, tyrannical.\\n\\nthe decision will be easily given, he replied; they shall be choruses\\ncoming on the stage, and i must judge them in the order in which they\\nenter, by the criterion of virtue and vice, happiness and misery.\\n\\nneed we hire a herald, or shall i announce, that the son of ariston\\n(the best) has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest,\\nand that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself;\\nand that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable, and\\nthat this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the\\ngreatest tyrant of his state?\\n\\nmake the proclamation yourself, he said.\\n\\nand shall i add, ‘whether seen or unseen by gods and men’?\\n\\nlet the words be added.\\n\\nthen this, i said, will be our first proof; and there is another, which\\nmay also have some weight.\\n\\nwhat is that?\\n\\nthe second proof is derived from the nature of the soul: seeing that\\nthe individual soul, like the state, has been divided by us into three\\nprinciples, the division may, i think, furnish a new demonstration.\\n\\nof what nature?\\n\\nit seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures\\ncorrespond; also three desires and governing powers.\\n\\nhow do you mean? he said.\\n\\nthere is one principle with which, as we were saying, a man learns,\\nanother with which he is angry; the third, having many forms, has no\\nspecial name, but is denoted by the general term appetitive, from the\\nextraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and\\ndrinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of\\nit; also money-loving, because such desires are generally satisfied by\\nthe help of money.\\n\\nthat is true, he said.\\n\\nif we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were\\nconcerned with gain, we should then be able to fall back on a single\\nnotion; and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul\\nas loving gain or money.\\n\\ni agree with you.\\n\\nagain, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and\\nconquering and getting fame?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nsuppose we call it the contentious or ambitious—would the term be\\nsuitable?\\n\\nextremely suitable.\\n\\non the other hand, every one sees that the principle of knowledge is\\nwholly directed to the truth, and cares less than either of the others\\nfor gain or fame.\\n\\nfar less.\\n\\n‘lover of wisdom,’ ‘lover of knowledge,’ are titles which we may fitly\\napply to that part of the soul?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\none principle prevails in the souls of one class of men, another in\\nothers, as may happen?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthen we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of\\nmen—lovers of wisdom, lovers of honour, lovers of gain?\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nand there are three kinds of pleasure, which are their several objects?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nnow, if you examine the three classes of men, and ask of them in turn\\nwhich of their lives is pleasantest, each will be found praising his\\nown and depreciating that of others: the money-maker will contrast the\\nvanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid\\nadvantages of gold and silver?\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nand the lover of honour—what will be his opinion? will he not think\\nthat the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning,\\nif it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to him?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand are we to suppose, i said, that the philosopher sets any value on\\nother pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth,\\nand in that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not so far indeed from the\\nheaven of pleasure? does he not call the other pleasures necessary,\\nunder the idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would\\nrather not have them?\\n\\nthere can be no doubt of that, he replied.\\n\\nsince, then, the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in\\ndispute, and the question is not which life is more or less honourable,\\nor better or worse, but which is the more pleasant or painless—how\\nshall we know who speaks truly?\\n\\ni cannot myself tell, he said.\\n\\nwell, but what ought to be the criterion? is any better than experience\\nand wisdom and reason?\\n\\nthere cannot be a better, he said.\\n\\nthen, i said, reflect. of the three individuals, which has the greatest\\nexperience of all the pleasures which we enumerated? has the lover of\\ngain, in learning the nature of essential truth, greater experience of\\nthe pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of\\ngain?\\n\\nthe philosopher, he replied, has greatly the advantage; for he has of\\nnecessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his\\nchildhood upwards: but the lover of gain in all his experience has not\\nof necessity tasted—or, i should rather say, even had he desired, could\\nhardly have tasted—the sweetness of learning and knowing truth.\\n\\nthen the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain,\\nfor he has a double experience?\\n\\nyes, very great.\\n\\nagain, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the\\nlover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?\\n\\nnay, he said, all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their\\nobject; for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have\\ntheir crowd of admirers, and as they all receive honour they all have\\nexperience of the pleasures of honour; but the delight which is to be\\nfound in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only.\\n\\nhis experience, then, will enable him to judge better than any one?\\n\\nfar better.\\n\\nand he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nfurther, the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not\\npossessed by the covetous or ambitious man, but only by the\\nphilosopher?\\n\\nwhat faculty?\\n\\nreason, with whom, as we were saying, the decision ought to rest.\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nif wealth and gain were the criterion, then the praise or blame of the\\nlover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy?\\n\\nassuredly.\\n\\nor if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgment of the\\nambitious or pugnacious would be the truest?\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nbut since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges—\\n\\nthe only inference possible, he replied, is that pleasures which are\\napproved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest.\\n\\nand so we arrive at the result, that the pleasure of the intelligent\\npart of the soul is the pleasantest of the three, and that he of us in\\nwhom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life.\\n\\nunquestionably, he said, the wise man speaks with authority when he\\napproves of his own life.\\n\\nand what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the\\npleasure which is next?\\n\\nclearly that of the soldier and lover of honour; who is nearer to\\nhimself than the money-maker.\\n\\nlast comes the lover of gain?\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\ntwice in succession, then, has the just man overthrown the unjust in\\nthis conflict; and now comes the third trial, which is dedicated to\\nolympian zeus the saviour: a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure\\nexcept that of the wise is quite true and pure—all others are a shadow\\nonly; and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of\\nfalls?\\n\\nyes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself?\\n\\ni will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions.\\n\\nproceed.\\n\\nsay, then, is not pleasure opposed to pain?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain?\\n\\nthere is.\\n\\na state which is intermediate, and a sort of repose of the soul about\\neither—that is what you mean?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nyou remember what people say when they are sick?\\n\\nwhat do they say?\\n\\nthat after all nothing is pleasanter than health. but then they never\\nknew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill.\\n\\nyes, i know, he said.\\n\\nand when persons are suffering from acute pain, you must have heard\\nthem say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their\\npain?\\n\\ni have.\\n\\nand there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and\\ncessation of pain, and not any positive enjoyment, is extolled by them\\nas the greatest pleasure?\\n\\nyes, he said; at the time they are pleased and well content to be at\\nrest.\\n\\nagain, when pleasure ceases, that sort of rest or cessation will be\\npainful?\\n\\ndoubtless, he said.\\n\\nthen the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be\\npain?\\n\\nso it would seem.\\n\\nbut can that which is neither become both?\\n\\ni should say not.\\n\\nand both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul, are they not?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nbut that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion,\\nand in a mean between them?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nhow, then, can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is\\npleasure, or that the absence of pleasure is pain?\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nthis then is an appearance only and not a reality; that is to say, the\\nrest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful,\\nand painful in comparison of what is pleasant; but all these\\nrepresentations, when tried by the test of true pleasure, are not real\\nbut a sort of imposition?\\n\\nthat is the inference.\\n\\nlook at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains and\\nyou will no longer suppose, as you perhaps may at present, that\\npleasure is only the cessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.\\n\\nwhat are they, he said, and where shall i find them?\\n\\nthere are many of them: take as an example the pleasures of smell,\\nwhich are very great and have no antecedent pains; they come in a\\nmoment, and when they depart leave no pain behind them.\\n\\nmost true, he said.\\n\\nlet us not, then, be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the\\ncessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.\\n\\nno.\\n\\nstill, the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul\\nthrough the body are generally of this sort—they are reliefs of pain.\\n\\nthat is true.\\n\\nand the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like\\nnature?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nshall i give you an illustration of them?\\n\\nlet me hear.\\n\\nyou would allow, i said, that there is in nature an upper and lower and\\nmiddle region?\\n\\ni should.\\n\\nand if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region, would\\nhe not imagine that he is going up; and he who is standing in the\\nmiddle and sees whence he has come, would imagine that he is already in\\nthe upper region, if he has never seen the true upper world?\\n\\nto be sure, he said; how can he think otherwise?\\n\\nbut if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine,\\nthat he was descending?\\n\\nno doubt.\\n\\nall that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle\\nand lower regions?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthen can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth, as\\nthey have wrong ideas about many other things, should also have wrong\\nideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state; so that when\\nthey are only being drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think\\nthe pain which they experience to be real, and in like manner, when\\ndrawn away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state, they firmly\\nbelieve that they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure; they,\\nnot knowing pleasure, err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain,\\nwhich is like contrasting black with grey instead of white—can you\\nwonder, i say, at this?\\n\\nno, indeed; i should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite.\\n\\nlook at the matter thus:—hunger, thirst, and the like, are inanitions\\nof the bodily state?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that\\nwhich has more existence the truer?\\n\\nclearly, from that which has more.\\n\\nwhat classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your\\njudgment—those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of\\nsustenance are examples, or the class which contains true opinion and\\nknowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue? put the\\nquestion in this way:—which has a more pure being—that which is\\nconcerned with the invariable, the immortal, and the true, and is of\\nsuch a nature, and is found in such natures; or that which is concerned\\nwith and found in the variable and mortal, and is itself variable and\\nmortal?\\n\\nfar purer, he replied, is the being of that which is concerned with the\\ninvariable.\\n\\nand does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same\\ndegree as of essence?\\n\\nyes, of knowledge in the same degree.\\n\\nand of truth in the same degree?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of\\nessence?\\n\\nnecessarily.\\n\\nthen, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service of the\\nbody have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service\\nof the soul?\\n\\nfar less.\\n\\nand has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nwhat is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real\\nexistence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less\\nreal existence and is less real?\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nand if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according\\nto nature, that which is more really filled with more real being will\\nmore really and truly enjoy true pleasure; whereas that which\\nparticipates in less real being will be less truly and surely\\nsatisfied, and will participate in an illusory and less real pleasure?\\n\\nunquestionably.\\n\\nthose then who know not wisdom and virtue, and are always busy with\\ngluttony and sensuality, go down and up again as far as the mean; and\\nin this region they move at random throughout life, but they never pass\\ninto the true upper world; thither they neither look, nor do they ever\\nfind their way, neither are they truly filled with true being, nor do\\nthey taste of pure and abiding pleasure. like cattle, with their eyes\\nalways looking down and their heads stooping to the earth, that is, to\\nthe dining-table, they fatten and feed and breed, and, in their\\nexcessive love of these delights, they kick and butt at one another\\nwith horns and hoofs which are made of iron; and they kill one another\\nby reason of their insatiable lust. for they fill themselves with that\\nwhich is not substantial, and the part of themselves which they fill is\\nalso unsubstantial and incontinent.\\n\\nverily, socrates, said glaucon, you describe the life of the many like\\nan oracle.\\n\\ntheir pleasures are mixed with pains—how can they be otherwise? for\\nthey are mere shadows and pictures of the true, and are coloured by\\ncontrast, which exaggerates both light and shade, and so they implant\\nin the minds of fools insane desires of themselves; and they are fought\\nabout as stesichorus says that the greeks fought about the shadow of\\nhelen at troy in ignorance of the truth.\\n\\nsomething of that sort must inevitably happen.\\n\\nand must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of\\nthe soul? will not the passionate man who carries his passion into\\naction, be in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious, or\\nviolent and contentious, or angry and discontented, if he be seeking to\\nattain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without\\nreason or sense?\\n\\nyes, he said, the same will happen with the spirited element also.\\n\\nthen may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour,\\nwhen they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of\\nreason and knowledge, and pursue after and win the pleasures which\\nwisdom shows them, will also have the truest pleasures in the highest\\ndegree which is attainable to them, inasmuch as they follow truth; and\\nthey will have the pleasures which are natural to them, if that which\\nis best for each one is also most natural to him?\\n\\nyes, certainly; the best is the most natural.\\n\\nand when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle, and there\\nis no division, the several parts are just, and do each of them their\\nown business, and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of\\nwhich they are capable?\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nbut when either of the two other principles prevails, it fails in\\nattaining its own pleasure, and compels the rest to pursue after a\\npleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and\\nreason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance\\nfrom law and order?\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nand the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest\\ndistance? yes.\\n\\nand the royal and orderly desires are nearest?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthen the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural\\npleasure, and the king at the least?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nbut if so, the tyrant will live most unpleasantly, and the king most\\npleasantly?\\n\\ninevitably.\\n\\nwould you know the measure of the interval which separates them?\\n\\nwill you tell me?\\n\\nthere appear to be three pleasures, one genuine and two spurious: now\\nthe transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious; he\\nhas run away from the region of law and reason, and taken up his abode\\nwith certain slave pleasures which are his satellites, and the measure\\nof his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure.\\n\\nhow do you mean?\\n\\ni assume, i said, that the tyrant is in the third place from the\\noligarch; the democrat was in the middle?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an\\nimage of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure\\nof the oligarch?\\n\\nhe will.\\n\\nand the oligarch is third from the royal; since we count as one royal\\nand aristocratical?\\n\\nyes, he is third.\\n\\nthen the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number\\nwhich is three times three?\\n\\nmanifestly.\\n\\nthe shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of\\nlength will be a plane figure.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand if you raise the power and make the plane a solid, there is no\\ndifficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is\\nparted from the king.\\n\\nyes; the arithmetician will easily do the sum.\\n\\nor if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval by\\nwhich the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure, he will\\nfind him, when the multiplication is completed, living 729 times more\\npleasantly, and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval.\\n\\nwhat a wonderful calculation! and how enormous is the distance which\\nseparates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain!\\n\\nyet a true calculation, i said, and a number which nearly concerns\\nhuman life, if human beings are concerned with days and nights and\\nmonths and years. (729 nearly equals the number of days and nights in\\nthe year.)\\n\\nyes, he said, human life is certainly concerned with them.\\n\\nthen if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil\\nand unjust, his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of\\nlife and in beauty and virtue?\\n\\nimmeasurably greater.\\n\\nwell, i said, and now having arrived at this stage of the argument, we\\nmay revert to the words which brought us hither: was not some one\\nsaying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was\\nreputed to be just?\\n\\nyes, that was said.\\n\\nnow then, having determined the power and quality of justice and\\ninjustice, let us have a little conversation with him.\\n\\nwhat shall we say to him?\\n\\nlet us make an image of the soul, that he may have his own words\\npresented before his eyes.\\n\\nof what sort?\\n\\nan ideal image of the soul, like the composite creations of ancient\\nmythology, such as the chimera or scylla or cerberus, and there are\\nmany others in which two or more different natures are said to grow\\ninto one.\\n\\nthere are said of have been such unions.\\n\\nthen do you now model the form of a multitudinous, many-headed monster,\\nhaving a ring of heads of all manner of beasts, tame and wild, which he\\nis able to generate and metamorphose at will.\\n\\nyou suppose marvellous powers in the artist; but, as language is more\\npliable than wax or any similar substance, let there be such a model as\\nyou propose.\\n\\nsuppose now that you make a second form as of a lion, and a third of a\\nman, the second smaller than the first, and the third smaller than the\\nsecond.\\n\\nthat, he said, is an easier task; and i have made them as you say.\\n\\nand now join them, and let the three grow into one.\\n\\nthat has been accomplished.\\n\\nnext fashion the outside of them into a single image, as of a man, so\\nthat he who is not able to look within, and sees only the outer hull,\\nmay believe the beast to be a single human creature.\\n\\ni have done so, he said.\\n\\nand now, to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human\\ncreature to be unjust, and unprofitable to be just, let us reply that,\\nif he be right, it is profitable for this creature to feast the\\nmultitudinous monster and strengthen the lion and the lion-like\\nqualities, but to starve and weaken the man, who is consequently liable\\nto be dragged about at the mercy of either of the other two; and he is\\nnot to attempt to familiarize or harmonize them with one another—he\\nought rather to suffer them to fight and bite and devour one another.\\n\\ncertainly, he said; that is what the approver of injustice says.\\n\\nto him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so\\nspeak and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the\\nmost complete mastery over the entire human creature. he should watch\\nover the many-headed monster like a good husbandman, fostering and\\ncultivating the gentle qualities, and preventing the wild ones from\\ngrowing; he should be making the lion-heart his ally, and in common\\ncare of them all should be uniting the several parts with one another\\nand with himself.\\n\\nyes, he said, that is quite what the maintainer of justice say.\\n\\nand so from every point of view, whether of pleasure, honour, or\\nadvantage, the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth, and\\nthe disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant?\\n\\nyes, from every point of view.\\n\\ncome, now, and let us gently reason with the unjust, who is not\\nintentionally in error. ‘sweet sir,’ we will say to him, ‘what think\\nyou of things esteemed noble and ignoble? is not the noble that which\\nsubjects the beast to the man, or rather to the god in man; and the\\nignoble that which subjects the man to the beast?’ he can hardly avoid\\nsaying yes—can he now?\\n\\nnot if he has any regard for my opinion.\\n\\nbut, if he agree so far, we may ask him to answer another question:\\n‘then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the\\ncondition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst?\\nwho can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery\\nfor money, especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil\\nmen, would be the gainer, however large might be the sum which he\\nreceived? and will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff who\\nremorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most godless\\nand detestable? eriphyle took the necklace as the price of her\\nhusband’s life, but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a worse\\nruin.’\\n\\nyes, said glaucon, far worse—i will answer for him.\\n\\nhas not the intemperate been censured of old, because in him the huge\\nmultiform monster is allowed to be too much at large?\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nand men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent\\nelement in them disproportionately grows and gains strength?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand luxury and softness are blamed, because they relax and weaken this\\nsame creature, and make a coward of him?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates\\nthe spirited animal to the unruly monster, and, for the sake of money,\\nof which he can never have enough, habituates him in the days of his\\nyouth to be trampled in the mire, and from being a lion to become a\\nmonkey?\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nand why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach? only because\\nthey imply a natural weakness of the higher principle; the individual\\nis unable to control the creatures within him, but has to court them,\\nand his great study is how to flatter them.\\n\\nsuch appears to be the reason.\\n\\nand therefore, being desirous of placing him under a rule like that of\\nthe best, we say that he ought to be the servant of the best, in whom\\nthe divine rules; not, as thrasymachus supposed, to the injury of the\\nservant, but because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom\\ndwelling within him; or, if this be impossible, then by an external\\nauthority, in order that we may be all, as far as possible, under the\\nsame government, friends and equals.\\n\\ntrue, he said.\\n\\nand this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law, which is the\\nally of the whole city; and is seen also in the authority which we\\nexercise over children, and the refusal to let them be free until we\\nhave established in them a principle analogous to the constitution of a\\nstate, and by cultivation of this higher element have set up in their\\nhearts a guardian and ruler like our own, and when this is done they\\nmay go their ways.\\n\\nyes, he said, the purpose of the law is manifest.\\n\\nfrom what point of view, then, and on what ground can we say that a man\\nis profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness, which will\\nmake him a worse man, even though he acquire money or power by his\\nwickedness?\\n\\nfrom no point of view at all.\\n\\nwhat shall he profit, if his injustice be undetected and unpunished? he\\nwho is undetected only gets worse, whereas he who is detected and\\npunished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized; the\\ngentler element in him is liberated, and his whole soul is perfected\\nand ennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom,\\nmore than the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty, strength and\\nhealth, in proportion as the soul is more honourable than the body.\\n\\ncertainly, he said.\\n\\nto this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the\\nenergies of his life. and in the first place, he will honour studies\\nwhich impress these qualities on his soul and will disregard others?\\n\\nclearly, he said.\\n\\nin the next place, he will regulate his bodily habit and training, and\\nso far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures,\\nthat he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter; his first\\nobject will be not that he may be fair or strong or well, unless he is\\nlikely thereby to gain temperance, but he will always desire so to\\nattemper the body as to preserve the harmony of the soul?\\n\\ncertainly he will, if he has true music in him.\\n\\nand in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and\\nharmony which he will also observe; he will not allow himself to be\\ndazzled by the foolish applause of the world, and heap up riches to his\\nown infinite harm?\\n\\ncertainly not, he said.\\n\\nhe will look at the city which is within him, and take heed that no\\ndisorder occur in it, such as might arise either from superfluity or\\nfrom want; and upon this principle he will regulate his property and\\ngain or spend according to his means.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand, for the same reason, he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours\\nas he deems likely to make him a better man; but those, whether private\\nor public, which are likely to disorder his life, he will avoid?\\n\\nthen, if that is his motive, he will not be a statesman.\\n\\nby the dog of egypt, he will! in the city which is his own he certainly\\nwill, though in the land of his birth perhaps not, unless he have a\\ndivine call.\\n\\ni understand; you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we\\nare the founders, and which exists in idea only; for i do not believe\\nthat there is such an one anywhere on earth?\\n\\nin heaven, i replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks, which\\nhe who desires may behold, and beholding, may set his own house in\\norder. but whether such an one exists, or ever will exist in fact, is\\nno matter; for he will live after the manner of that city, having\\nnothing to do with any other.\\n\\ni think so, he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book x.\\n\\n\\nof the many excellences which i perceive in the order of our state,\\nthere is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule\\nabout poetry.\\n\\nto what do you refer?\\n\\nto the rejection of imitative poetry, which certainly ought not to be\\nreceived; as i see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have\\nbeen distinguished.\\n\\nwhat do you mean?\\n\\nspeaking in confidence, for i should not like to have my words repeated\\nto the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe—but i do not mind\\nsaying to you, that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the\\nunderstanding of the hearers, and that the knowledge of their true\\nnature is the only antidote to them.\\n\\nexplain the purport of your remark.\\n\\nwell, i will tell you, although i have always from my earliest youth\\nhad an awe and love of homer, which even now makes the words falter on\\nmy lips, for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that\\ncharming tragic company; but a man is not to be reverenced more than\\nthe truth, and therefore i will speak out.\\n\\nvery good, he said.\\n\\nlisten to me then, or rather, answer me.\\n\\nput your question.\\n\\ncan you tell me what imitation is? for i really do not know.\\n\\na likely thing, then, that i should know.\\n\\nwhy not? for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the\\nkeener.\\n\\nvery true, he said; but in your presence, even if i had any faint\\nnotion, i could not muster courage to utter it. will you enquire\\nyourself?\\n\\nwell then, shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner: whenever a\\nnumber of individuals have a common name, we assume them to have also a\\ncorresponding idea or form:—do you understand me?\\n\\ni do.\\n\\nlet us take any common instance; there are beds and tables in the\\nworld—plenty of them, are there not?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nbut there are only two ideas or forms of them—one the idea of a bed,\\nthe other of a table.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our\\nuse, in accordance with the idea—that is our way of speaking in this\\nand similar instances—but no artificer makes the ideas themselves: how\\ncould he?\\n\\nimpossible.\\n\\nand there is another artist,—i should like to know what you would say\\nof him.\\n\\nwho is he?\\n\\none who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen.\\n\\nwhat an extraordinary man!\\n\\nwait a little, and there will be more reason for your saying so. for\\nthis is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind, but\\nplants and animals, himself and all other things—the earth and heaven,\\nand the things which are in heaven or under the earth; he makes the\\ngods also.\\n\\nhe must be a wizard and no mistake.\\n\\noh! you are incredulous, are you? do you mean that there is no such\\nmaker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all\\nthese things but in another not? do you see that there is a way in\\nwhich you could make them all yourself?\\n\\nwhat way?\\n\\nan easy way enough; or rather, there are many ways in which the feat\\nmight be quickly and easily accomplished, none quicker than that of\\nturning a mirror round and round—you would soon enough make the sun and\\nthe heavens, and the earth and yourself, and other animals and plants,\\nand all the other things of which we were just now speaking, in the\\nmirror.\\n\\nyes, he said; but they would be appearances only.\\n\\nvery good, i said, you are coming to the point now. and the painter too\\nis, as i conceive, just such another—a creator of appearances, is he\\nnot?\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nbut then i suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue. and yet\\nthere is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed?\\n\\nyes, he said, but not a real bed.\\n\\nand what of the maker of the bed? were you not saying that he too\\nmakes, not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the\\nbed, but only a particular bed?\\n\\nyes, i did.\\n\\nthen if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true\\nexistence, but only some semblance of existence; and if any one were to\\nsay that the work of the maker of the bed, or of any other workman, has\\nreal existence, he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth.\\n\\nat any rate, he replied, philosophers would say that he was not\\nspeaking the truth.\\n\\nno wonder, then, that his work too is an indistinct expression of\\ntruth.\\n\\nno wonder.\\n\\nsuppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire\\nwho this imitator is?\\n\\nif you please.\\n\\nwell then, here are three beds: one existing in nature, which is made\\nby god, as i think that we may say—for no one else can be the maker?\\n\\nno.\\n\\nthere is another which is the work of the carpenter?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand the work of the painter is a third?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nbeds, then, are of three kinds, and there are three artists who\\nsuperintend them: god, the maker of the bed, and the painter?\\n\\nyes, there are three of them.\\n\\ngod, whether from choice or from necessity, made one bed in nature and\\none only; two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever\\nwill be made by god.\\n\\nwhy is that?\\n\\nbecause even if he had made but two, a third would still appear behind\\nthem which both of them would have for their idea, and that would be\\nthe ideal bed and not the two others.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\ngod knew this, and he desired to be the real maker of a real bed, not a\\nparticular maker of a particular bed, and therefore he created a bed\\nwhich is essentially and by nature one only.\\n\\nso we believe.\\n\\nshall we, then, speak of him as the natural author or maker of the bed?\\n\\nyes, he replied; inasmuch as by the natural process of creation he is\\nthe author of this and of all other things.\\n\\nand what shall we say of the carpenter—is not he also the maker of the\\nbed?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nbut would you call the painter a creator and maker?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nyet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?\\n\\ni think, he said, that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of\\nthat which the others make.\\n\\ngood, i said; then you call him who is third in the descent from nature\\nan imitator?\\n\\ncertainly, he said.\\n\\nand the tragic poet is an imitator, and therefore, like all other\\nimitators, he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth?\\n\\nthat appears to be so.\\n\\nthen about the imitator we are agreed. and what about the painter?—i\\nwould like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which\\noriginally exists in nature, or only the creations of artists?\\n\\nthe latter.\\n\\nas they are or as they appear? you have still to determine this.\\n\\nwhat do you mean?\\n\\ni mean, that you may look at a bed from different points of view,\\nobliquely or directly or from any other point of view, and the bed will\\nappear different, but there is no difference in reality. and the same\\nof all things.\\n\\nyes, he said, the difference is only apparent.\\n\\nnow let me ask you another question: which is the art of painting\\ndesigned to be—an imitation of things as they are, or as they appear—of\\nappearance or of reality?\\n\\nof appearance.\\n\\nthen the imitator, i said, is a long way off the truth, and can do all\\nthings because he lightly touches on a small part of them, and that\\npart an image. for example: a painter will paint a cobbler, carpenter,\\nor any other artist, though he knows nothing of their arts; and, if he\\nis a good artist, he may deceive children or simple persons, when he\\nshows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance, and they will\\nfancy that they are looking at a real carpenter.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all\\nthe arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single\\nthing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man—whoever tells\\nus this, i think that we can only imagine him to be a simple creature\\nwho is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he\\nmet, and whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to\\nanalyse the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation.\\n\\nmost true.\\n\\nand so, when we hear persons saying that the tragedians, and homer, who\\nis at their head, know all the arts and all things human, virtue as\\nwell as vice, and divine things too, for that the good poet cannot\\ncompose well unless he knows his subject, and that he who has not this\\nknowledge can never be a poet, we ought to consider whether here also\\nthere may not be a similar illusion. perhaps they may have come across\\nimitators and been deceived by them; they may not have remembered when\\nthey saw their works that these were but imitations thrice removed from\\nthe truth, and could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth,\\nbecause they are appearances only and not realities? or, after all,\\nthey may be in the right, and poets do really know the things about\\nwhich they seem to the many to speak so well?\\n\\nthe question, he said, should by all means be considered.\\n\\nnow do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as\\nwell as the image, he would seriously devote himself to the\\nimage-making branch? would he allow imitation to be the ruling\\nprinciple of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?\\n\\ni should say not.\\n\\nthe real artist, who knew what he was imitating, would be interested in\\nrealities and not in imitations; and would desire to leave as memorials\\nof himself works many and fair; and, instead of being the author of\\nencomiums, he would prefer to be the theme of them.\\n\\nyes, he said, that would be to him a source of much greater honour and\\nprofit.\\n\\nthen, i said, we must put a question to homer; not about medicine, or\\nany of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer: we are not\\ngoing to ask him, or any other poet, whether he has cured patients like\\nasclepius, or left behind him a school of medicine such as the\\nasclepiads were, or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts\\nat second-hand; but we have a right to know respecting military\\ntactics, politics, education, which are the chiefest and noblest\\nsubjects of his poems, and we may fairly ask him about them. ‘friend\\nhomer,’ then we say to him, ‘if you are only in the second remove from\\ntruth in what you say of virtue, and not in the third—not an image\\nmaker or imitator—and if you are able to discern what pursuits make men\\nbetter or worse in private or public life, tell us what state was ever\\nbetter governed by your help? the good order of lacedaemon is due to\\nlycurgus, and many other cities great and small have been similarly\\nbenefited by others; but who says that you have been a good legislator\\nto them and have done them any good? italy and sicily boast of\\ncharondas, and there is solon who is renowned among us; but what city\\nhas anything to say about you?’ is there any city which he might name?\\n\\ni think not, said glaucon; not even the homerids themselves pretend\\nthat he was a legislator.\\n\\nwell, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully\\nby him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?\\n\\nthere is not.\\n\\nor is there any invention of his, applicable to the arts or to human\\nlife, such as thales the milesian or anacharsis the scythian, and other\\ningenious men have conceived, which is attributed to him?\\n\\nthere is absolutely nothing of the kind.\\n\\nbut, if homer never did any public service, was he privately a guide or\\nteacher of any? had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate\\nwith him, and who handed down to posterity an homeric way of life, such\\nas was established by pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his\\nwisdom, and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the\\norder which was named after him?\\n\\nnothing of the kind is recorded of him. for surely, socrates,\\ncreophylus, the companion of homer, that child of flesh, whose name\\nalways makes us laugh, might be more justly ridiculed for his\\nstupidity, if, as is said, homer was greatly neglected by him and\\nothers in his own day when he was alive?\\n\\nyes, i replied, that is the tradition. but can you imagine, glaucon,\\nthat if homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind—if he\\nhad possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator—can you imagine, i\\nsay, that he would not have had many followers, and been honoured and\\nloved by them? protagoras of abdera, and prodicus of ceos, and a host\\nof others, have only to whisper to their contemporaries: ‘you will\\nnever be able to manage either your own house or your own state until\\nyou appoint us to be your ministers of education’—and this ingenious\\ndevice of theirs has such an effect in making men love them that their\\ncompanions all but carry them about on their shoulders. and is it\\nconceivable that the contemporaries of homer, or again of hesiod, would\\nhave allowed either of them to go about as rhapsodists, if they had\\nreally been able to make mankind virtuous? would they not have been as\\nunwilling to part with them as with gold, and have compelled them to\\nstay at home with them? or, if the master would not stay, then the\\ndisciples would have followed him about everywhere, until they had got\\neducation enough?\\n\\nyes, socrates, that, i think, is quite true.\\n\\nthen must we not infer that all these poetical individuals, beginning\\nwith homer, are only imitators; they copy images of virtue and the\\nlike, but the truth they never reach? the poet is like a painter who,\\nas we have already observed, will make a likeness of a cobbler though\\nhe understands nothing of cobbling; and his picture is good enough for\\nthose who know no more than he does, and judge only by colours and\\nfigures.\\n\\nquite so.\\n\\nin like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to lay\\non the colours of the several arts, himself understanding their nature\\nonly enough to imitate them; and other people, who are as ignorant as\\nhe is, and judge only from his words, imagine that if he speaks of\\ncobbling, or of military tactics, or of anything else, in metre and\\nharmony and rhythm, he speaks very well—such is the sweet influence\\nwhich melody and rhythm by nature have. and i think that you must have\\nobserved again and again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make\\nwhen stripped of the colours which music puts upon them, and recited in\\nsimple prose.\\n\\nyes, he said.\\n\\nthey are like faces which were never really beautiful, but only\\nblooming; and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them?\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nhere is another point: the imitator or maker of the image knows nothing\\nof true existence; he knows appearances only. am i not right?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nthen let us have a clear understanding, and not be satisfied with half\\nan explanation.\\n\\nproceed.\\n\\nof the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a\\nbit?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand the worker in leather and brass will make them?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nbut does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins? nay,\\nhardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the\\nhorseman who knows how to use them—he knows their right form.\\n\\nmost true.\\n\\nand may we not say the same of all things?\\n\\nwhat?\\n\\nthat there are three arts which are concerned with all things: one\\nwhich uses, another which makes, a third which imitates them?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure, animate or\\ninanimate, and of every action of man, is relative to the use for which\\nnature or the artist has intended them.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthen the user of them must have the greatest experience of them, and he\\nmust indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop\\nthemselves in use; for example, the flute-player will tell the\\nflute-maker which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer; he\\nwill tell him how he ought to make them, and the other will attend to\\nhis instructions?\\n\\nof course.\\n\\nthe one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness\\nand badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do what\\nhe is told by him?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthe instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of it\\nthe maker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will gain\\nfrom him who knows, by talking to him and being compelled to hear what\\nhe has to say, whereas the user will have knowledge?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nbut will the imitator have either? will he know from use whether or no\\nhis drawing is correct or beautiful? or will he have right opinion from\\nbeing compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him\\ninstructions about what he should draw?\\n\\nneither.\\n\\nthen he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge\\nabout the goodness or badness of his imitations?\\n\\ni suppose not.\\n\\nthe imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about\\nhis own creations?\\n\\nnay, very much the reverse.\\n\\nand still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing\\ngood or bad, and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which\\nappears to be good to the ignorant multitude?\\n\\njust so.\\n\\nthus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no\\nknowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates. imitation is only a\\nkind of play or sport, and the tragic poets, whether they write in\\niambic or in heroic verse, are imitators in the highest degree?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand now tell me, i conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us to\\nbe concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?\\n\\nwhat do you mean?\\n\\ni will explain: the body which is large when seen near, appears small\\nwhen seen at a distance?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water,\\nand crooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing to\\nthe illusion about colours to which the sight is liable. thus every\\nsort of confusion is revealed within us; and this is that weakness of\\nthe human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light\\nand shadow and other ingenious devices imposes, having an effect upon\\nus like magic.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue\\nof the human understanding—there is the beauty of them—and the apparent\\ngreater or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery over\\nus, but give way before calculation and measure and weight?\\n\\nmost true.\\n\\nand this, surely, must be the work of the calculating and rational\\nprinciple in the soul?\\n\\nto be sure.\\n\\nand when this principle measures and certifies that some things are\\nequal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an\\napparent contradiction?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nbut were we not saying that such a contradiction is impossible—the same\\nfaculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same\\nthing?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nthen that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is\\nnot the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to\\nmeasure and calculation?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of\\nthe soul?\\n\\nno doubt.\\n\\nthis was the conclusion at which i was seeking to arrive when i said\\nthat painting or drawing, and imitation in general, when doing their\\nown proper work, are far removed from truth, and the companions and\\nfriends and associates of a principle within us which is equally\\nremoved from reason, and that they have no true or healthy aim.\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nthe imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior, and has\\ninferior offspring.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the\\nhearing also, relating in fact to what we term poetry?\\n\\nprobably the same would be true of poetry.\\n\\ndo not rely, i said, on a probability derived from the analogy of\\npainting; but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with\\nwhich poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad.\\n\\nby all means.\\n\\nwe may state the question thus:—imitation imitates the actions of men,\\nwhether voluntary or involuntary, on which, as they imagine, a good or\\nbad result has ensued, and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly. is there\\nanything more?\\n\\nno, there is nothing else.\\n\\nbut in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with\\nhimself—or rather, as in the instance of sight there was confusion and\\nopposition in his opinions about the same things, so here also is there\\nnot strife and inconsistency in his life? though i need hardly raise\\nthe question again, for i remember that all this has been already\\nadmitted; and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these\\nand ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment?\\n\\nand we were right, he said.\\n\\nyes, i said, thus far we were right; but there was an omission which\\nmust now be supplied.\\n\\nwhat was the omission?\\n\\nwere we not saying that a good man, who has the misfortune to lose his\\nson or anything else which is most dear to him, will bear the loss with\\nmore equanimity than another?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nbut will he have no sorrow, or shall we say that although he cannot\\nhelp sorrowing, he will moderate his sorrow?\\n\\nthe latter, he said, is the truer statement.\\n\\ntell me: will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his\\nsorrow when he is seen by his equals, or when he is alone?\\n\\nit will make a great difference whether he is seen or not.\\n\\nwhen he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things\\nwhich he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthere is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist, as\\nwell as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his\\nsorrow?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nbut when a man is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from the\\nsame object, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct\\nprinciples in him?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\none of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law?\\n\\nhow do you mean?\\n\\nthe law would say that to be patient under suffering is best, and that\\nwe should not give way to impatience, as there is no knowing whether\\nsuch things are good or evil; and nothing is gained by impatience;\\nalso, because no human thing is of serious importance, and grief stands\\nin the way of that which at the moment is most required.\\n\\nwhat is most required? he asked.\\n\\nthat we should take counsel about what has happened, and when the dice\\nhave been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best;\\nnot, like children who have had a fall, keeping hold of the part struck\\nand wasting time in setting up a howl, but always accustoming the soul\\nforthwith to apply a remedy, raising up that which is sickly and\\nfallen, banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art.\\n\\nyes, he said, that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune.\\n\\nyes, i said; and the higher principle is ready to follow this\\nsuggestion of reason?\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nand the other principle, which inclines us to recollection of our\\ntroubles and to lamentation, and can never have enough of them, we may\\ncall irrational, useless, and cowardly?\\n\\nindeed, we may.\\n\\nand does not the latter—i mean the rebellious principle—furnish a great\\nvariety of materials for imitation? whereas the wise and calm\\ntemperament, being always nearly equable, is not easy to imitate or to\\nappreciate when imitated, especially at a public festival when a\\npromiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre. for the feeling\\nrepresented is one to which they are strangers.\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nthen the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature\\nmade, nor is his art intended, to please or to affect the rational\\nprinciple in the soul; but he will prefer the passionate and fitful\\ntemper, which is easily imitated?\\n\\nclearly.\\n\\nand now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the\\npainter, for he is like him in two ways: first, inasmuch as his\\ncreations have an inferior degree of truth—in this, i say, he is like\\nhim; and he is also like him in being concerned with an inferior part\\nof the soul; and therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him\\ninto a well-ordered state, because he awakens and nourishes and\\nstrengthens the feelings and impairs the reason. as in a city when the\\nevil are permitted to have authority and the good are put out of the\\nway, so in the soul of man, as we maintain, the imitative poet implants\\nan evil constitution, for he indulges the irrational nature which has\\nno discernment of greater and less, but thinks the same thing at one\\ntime great and at another small—he is a manufacturer of images and is\\nvery far removed from the truth.\\n\\nexactly.\\n\\nbut we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our\\naccusation:—the power which poetry has of harming even the good (and\\nthere are very few who are not harmed), is surely an awful thing?\\n\\nyes, certainly, if the effect is what you say.\\n\\nhear and judge: the best of us, as i conceive, when we listen to a\\npassage of homer, or one of the tragedians, in which he represents some\\npitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration, or\\nweeping, and smiting his breast—the best of us, you know, delight in\\ngiving way to sympathy, and are in raptures at the excellence of the\\npoet who stirs our feelings most.\\n\\nyes, of course i know.\\n\\nbut when any sorrow of our own happens to us, then you may observe that\\nwe pride ourselves on the opposite quality—we would fain be quiet and\\npatient; this is the manly part, and the other which delighted us in\\nthe recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman.\\n\\nvery true, he said.\\n\\nnow can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that\\nwhich any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own\\nperson?\\n\\nno, he said, that is certainly not reasonable.\\n\\nnay, i said, quite reasonable from one point of view.\\n\\nwhat point of view?\\n\\nif you consider, i said, that when in misfortune we feel a natural\\nhunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation, and\\nthat this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is\\nsatisfied and delighted by the poets;—the better nature in each of us,\\nnot having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit, allows the\\nsympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is another’s; and\\nthe spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in\\npraising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good man he\\nis, and making a fuss about his troubles; he thinks that the pleasure\\nis a gain, and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem\\ntoo? few persons ever reflect, as i should imagine, that from the evil\\nof other men something of evil is communicated to themselves. and so\\nthe feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the\\nmisfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own.\\n\\nhow very true!\\n\\nand does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? there are jests\\nwhich you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic\\nstage, or indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused\\nby them, and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness;—the case\\nof pity is repeated;—there is a principle in human nature which is\\ndisposed to raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by\\nreason, because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let\\nout again; and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre,\\nyou are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet\\nat home.\\n\\nquite true, he said.\\n\\nand the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other\\naffections, of desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be\\ninseparable from every action—in all of them poetry feeds and waters\\nthe passions instead of drying them up; she lets them rule, although\\nthey ought to be controlled, if mankind are ever to increase in\\nhappiness and virtue.\\n\\ni cannot deny it.\\n\\ntherefore, glaucon, i said, whenever you meet with any of the eulogists\\nof homer declaring that he has been the educator of hellas, and that he\\nis profitable for education and for the ordering of human things, and\\nthat you should take him up again and again and get to know him and\\nregulate your whole life according to him, we may love and honour those\\nwho say these things—they are excellent people, as far as their lights\\nextend; and we are ready to acknowledge that homer is the greatest of\\npoets and first of tragedy writers; but we must remain firm in our\\nconviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the\\nonly poetry which ought to be admitted into our state. for if you go\\nbeyond this and allow the honeyed muse to enter, either in epic or\\nlyric verse, not law and the reason of mankind, which by common consent\\nhave ever been deemed best, but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in\\nour state.\\n\\nthat is most true, he said.\\n\\nand now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry, let this our\\ndefence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in\\nsending away out of our state an art having the tendencies which we\\nhave described; for reason constrained us. but that she may not impute\\nto us any harshness or want of politeness, let us tell her that there\\nis an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry; of which there are\\nmany proofs, such as the saying of ‘the yelping hound howling at her\\nlord,’ or of one ‘mighty in the vain talk of fools,’ and ‘the mob of\\nsages circumventing zeus,’ and the ‘subtle thinkers who are beggars\\nafter all’; and there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity\\nbetween them. notwithstanding this, let us assure our sweet friend and\\nthe sister arts of imitation, that if she will only prove her title to\\nexist in a well-ordered state we shall be delighted to receive her—we\\nare very conscious of her charms; but we may not on that account betray\\nthe truth. i dare say, glaucon, that you are as much charmed by her as\\ni am, especially when she appears in homer?\\n\\nyes, indeed, i am greatly charmed.\\n\\nshall i propose, then, that she be allowed to return from exile, but\\nupon this condition only—that she make a defence of herself in lyrical\\nor some other metre?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nand we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of\\npoetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her\\nbehalf: let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to\\nstates and to human life, and we will listen in a kindly spirit; for if\\nthis can be proved we shall surely be the gainers—i mean, if there is a\\nuse in poetry as well as a delight?\\n\\ncertainly, he said, we shall be the gainers.\\n\\nif her defence fails, then, my dear friend, like other persons who are\\nenamoured of something, but put a restraint upon themselves when they\\nthink their desires are opposed to their interests, so too must we\\nafter the manner of lovers give her up, though not without a struggle.\\nwe too are inspired by that love of poetry which the education of noble\\nstates has implanted in us, and therefore we would have her appear at\\nher best and truest; but so long as she is unable to make good her\\ndefence, this argument of ours shall be a charm to us, which we will\\nrepeat to ourselves while we listen to her strains; that we may not\\nfall away into the childish love of her which captivates the many. at\\nall events we are well aware that poetry being such as we have\\ndescribed is not to be regarded seriously as attaining to the truth;\\nand he who listens to her, fearing for the safety of the city which is\\nwithin him, should be on his guard against her seductions and make our\\nwords his law.\\n\\nyes, he said, i quite agree with you.\\n\\nyes, i said, my dear glaucon, for great is the issue at stake, greater\\nthan appears, whether a man is to be good or bad. and what will any one\\nbe profited if under the influence of honour or money or power, aye, or\\nunder the excitement of poetry, he neglect justice and virtue?\\n\\nyes, he said; i have been convinced by the argument, as i believe that\\nany one else would have been.\\n\\nand yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards\\nwhich await virtue.\\n\\nwhat, are there any greater still? if there are, they must be of an\\ninconceivable greatness.\\n\\nwhy, i said, what was ever great in a short time? the whole period of\\nthree score years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison\\nwith eternity?\\n\\nsay rather ‘nothing,’ he replied.\\n\\nand should an immortal being seriously think of this little space\\nrather than of the whole?\\n\\nof the whole, certainly. but why do you ask?\\n\\nare you not aware, i said, that the soul of man is immortal and\\nimperishable?\\n\\nhe looked at me in astonishment, and said: no, by heaven: and are you\\nreally prepared to maintain this?\\n\\nyes, i said, i ought to be, and you too—there is no difficulty in\\nproving it.\\n\\ni see a great difficulty; but i should like to hear you state this\\nargument of which you make so light.\\n\\nlisten then.\\n\\ni am attending.\\n\\nthere is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil?\\n\\nyes, he replied.\\n\\nwould you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying\\nelement is the evil, and the saving and improving element the good?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nand you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil; as\\nophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body; as\\nmildew is of corn, and rot of timber, or rust of copper and iron: in\\neverything, or in almost everything, there is an inherent evil and\\ndisease?\\n\\nyes, he said.\\n\\nand anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil, and\\nat last wholly dissolves and dies?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nthe vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of each;\\nand if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will; for\\ngood certainly will not destroy them, nor again, that which is neither\\ngood nor evil.\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nif, then, we find any nature which having this inherent corruption\\ncannot be dissolved or destroyed, we may be certain that of such a\\nnature there is no destruction?\\n\\nthat may be assumed.\\n\\nwell, i said, and is there no evil which corrupts the soul?\\n\\nyes, he said, there are all the evils which we were just now passing in\\nreview: unrighteousness, intemperance, cowardice, ignorance.\\n\\nbut does any of these dissolve or destroy her?—and here do not let us\\nfall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man, when\\nhe is detected, perishes through his own injustice, which is an evil of\\nthe soul. take the analogy of the body: the evil of the body is a\\ndisease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body; and all the\\nthings of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through\\ntheir own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so\\ndestroying them. is not this true?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nconsider the soul in like manner. does the injustice or other evil\\nwhich exists in the soul waste and consume her? do they by attaching to\\nthe soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so\\nseparate her from the body?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nand yet, i said, it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish\\nfrom without through affection of external evil which could not be\\ndestroyed from within by a corruption of its own?\\n\\nit is, he replied.\\n\\nconsider, i said, glaucon, that even the badness of food, whether\\nstaleness, decomposition, or any other bad quality, when confined to\\nthe actual food, is not supposed to destroy the body; although, if the\\nbadness of food communicates corruption to the body, then we should say\\nthat the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself, which is\\ndisease, brought on by this; but that the body, being one thing, can be\\ndestroyed by the badness of food, which is another, and which does not\\nengender any natural infection—this we shall absolutely deny?\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand, on the same principle, unless some bodily evil can produce an evil\\nof the soul, we must not suppose that the soul, which is one thing, can\\nbe dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another?\\n\\nyes, he said, there is reason in that.\\n\\neither, then, let us refute this conclusion, or, while it remains\\nunrefuted, let us never say that fever, or any other disease, or the\\nknife put to the throat, or even the cutting up of the whole body into\\nthe minutest pieces, can destroy the soul, until she herself is proved\\nto become more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things\\nbeing done to the body; but that the soul, or anything else if not\\ndestroyed by an internal evil, can be destroyed by an external one, is\\nnot to be affirmed by any man.\\n\\nand surely, he replied, no one will ever prove that the souls of men\\nbecome more unjust in consequence of death.\\n\\nbut if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the soul\\nboldly denies this, and says that the dying do really become more evil\\nand unrighteous, then, if the speaker is right, i suppose that\\ninjustice, like disease, must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust, and\\nthat those who take this disorder die by the natural inherent power of\\ndestruction which evil has, and which kills them sooner or later, but\\nin quite another way from that in which, at present, the wicked receive\\ndeath at the hands of others as the penalty of their deeds?\\n\\nnay, he said, in that case injustice, if fatal to the unjust, will not\\nbe so very terrible to him, for he will be delivered from evil. but i\\nrather suspect the opposite to be the truth, and that injustice which,\\nif it have the power, will murder others, keeps the murderer alive—aye,\\nand well awake too; so far removed is her dwelling-place from being a\\nhouse of death.\\n\\ntrue, i said; if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is\\nunable to kill or destroy her, hardly will that which is appointed to\\nbe the destruction of some other body, destroy a soul or anything else\\nexcept that of which it was appointed to be the destruction.\\n\\nyes, that can hardly be.\\n\\nbut the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil, whether inherent or\\nexternal, must exist for ever, and if existing for ever, must be\\nimmortal?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nthat is the conclusion, i said; and, if a true conclusion, then the\\nsouls must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will not\\ndiminish in number. neither will they increase, for the increase of the\\nimmortal natures must come from something mortal, and all things would\\nthus end in immortality.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nbut this we cannot believe—reason will not allow us—any more than we\\ncan believe the soul, in her truest nature, to be full of variety and\\ndifference and dissimilarity.\\n\\nwhat do you mean? he said.\\n\\nthe soul, i said, being, as is now proven, immortal, must be the\\nfairest of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements?\\n\\ncertainly not.\\n\\nher immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument, and there are\\nmany other proofs; but to see her as she really is, not as we now\\nbehold her, marred by communion with the body and other miseries, you\\nmust contemplate her with the eye of reason, in her original purity;\\nand then her beauty will be revealed, and justice and injustice and all\\nthe things which we have described will be manifested more clearly.\\nthus far, we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at\\npresent, but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a\\ncondition which may be compared to that of the sea-god glaucus, whose\\noriginal image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are\\nbroken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways,\\nand incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and\\nstones, so that he is more like some monster than he is to his own\\nnatural form. and the soul which we behold is in a similar condition,\\ndisfigured by ten thousand ills. but not there, glaucon, not there must\\nwe look.\\n\\nwhere then?\\n\\nat her love of wisdom. let us see whom she affects, and what society\\nand converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal\\nand eternal and divine; also how different she would become if wholly\\nfollowing this superior principle, and borne by a divine impulse out of\\nthe ocean in which she now is, and disengaged from the stones and\\nshells and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up\\naround her because she feeds upon earth, and is overgrown by the good\\nthings of this life as they are termed: then you would see her as she\\nis, and know whether she have one shape only or many, or what her\\nnature is. of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this\\npresent life i think that we have now said enough.\\n\\ntrue, he replied.\\n\\nand thus, i said, we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument; we\\nhave not introduced the rewards and glories of justice, which, as you\\nwere saying, are to be found in homer and hesiod; but justice in her\\nown nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature.\\nlet a man do what is just, whether he have the ring of gyges or not,\\nand even if in addition to the ring of gyges he put on the helmet of\\nhades.\\n\\nvery true.\\n\\nand now, glaucon, there will be no harm in further enumerating how many\\nand how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues\\nprocure to the soul from gods and men, both in life and after death.\\n\\ncertainly not, he said.\\n\\nwill you repay me, then, what you borrowed in the argument?\\n\\nwhat did i borrow?\\n\\nthe assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust\\njust: for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case\\ncould not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men, still this\\nadmission ought to be made for the sake of the argument, in order that\\npure justice might be weighed against pure injustice. do you remember?\\n\\ni should be much to blame if i had forgotten.\\n\\nthen, as the cause is decided, i demand on behalf of justice that the\\nestimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we\\nacknowledge to be her due should now be restored to her by us; since\\nshe has been shown to confer reality, and not to deceive those who\\ntruly possess her, let what has been taken from her be given back, that\\nso she may win that palm of appearance which is hers also, and which\\nshe gives to her own.\\n\\nthe demand, he said, is just.\\n\\nin the first place, i said—and this is the first thing which you will\\nhave to give back—the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known\\nto the gods.\\n\\ngranted.\\n\\nand if they are both known to them, one must be the friend and the\\nother the enemy of the gods, as we admitted from the beginning?\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all\\nthings at their best, excepting only such evil as is the necessary\\nconsequence of former sins?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nthen this must be our notion of the just man, that even when he is in\\npoverty or sickness, or any other seeming misfortune, all things will\\nin the end work together for good to him in life and death: for the\\ngods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be\\nlike god, as far as man can attain the divine likeness, by the pursuit\\nof virtue?\\n\\nyes, he said; if he is like god he will surely not be neglected by him.\\n\\nand of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed?\\n\\ncertainly.\\n\\nsuch, then, are the palms of victory which the gods give the just?\\n\\nthat is my conviction.\\n\\nand what do they receive of men? look at things as they really are, and\\nyou will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners, who run\\nwell from the starting-place to the goal but not back again from the\\ngoal: they go off at a great pace, but in the end only look foolish,\\nslinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders, and without\\na crown; but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the prize\\nand is crowned. and this is the way with the just; he who endures to\\nthe end of every action and occasion of his entire life has a good\\nreport and carries off the prize which men have to bestow.\\n\\ntrue.\\n\\nand now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which you\\nwere attributing to the fortunate unjust. i shall say of them, what you\\nwere saying of the others, that as they grow older, they become rulers\\nin their own city if they care to be; they marry whom they like and\\ngive in marriage to whom they will; all that you said of the others i\\nnow say of these. and, on the other hand, of the unjust i say that the\\ngreater number, even though they escape in their youth, are found out\\nat last and look foolish at the end of their course, and when they come\\nto be old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen; they\\nare beaten and then come those things unfit for ears polite, as you\\ntruly term them; they will be racked and have their eyes burned out, as\\nyou were saying. and you may suppose that i have repeated the remainder\\nof your tale of horrors. but will you let me assume, without reciting\\nthem, that these things are true?\\n\\ncertainly, he said, what you say is true.\\n\\nthese, then, are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed\\nupon the just by gods and men in this present life, in addition to the\\nother good things which justice of herself provides.\\n\\nyes, he said; and they are fair and lasting.\\n\\nand yet, i said, all these are as nothing either in number or greatness\\nin comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and\\nunjust after death. and you ought to hear them, and then both just and\\nunjust will have received from us a full payment of the debt which the\\nargument owes to them.\\n\\nspeak, he said; there are few things which i would more gladly hear.\\n\\nwell, i said, i will tell you a tale; not one of the tales which\\nodysseus tells to the hero alcinous, yet this too is a tale of a hero,\\ner the son of armenius, a pamphylian by birth. he was slain in battle,\\nand ten days afterwards, when the bodies of the dead were taken up\\nalready in a state of corruption, his body was found unaffected by\\ndecay, and carried away home to be buried. and on the twelfth day, as\\nhe was lying on the funeral pile, he returned to life and told them\\nwhat he had seen in the other world. he said that when his soul left\\nthe body he went on a journey with a great company, and that they came\\nto a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth;\\nthey were near together, and over against them were two other openings\\nin the heaven above. in the intermediate space there were judges\\nseated, who commanded the just, after they had given judgment on them\\nand had bound their sentences in front of them, to ascend by the\\nheavenly way on the right hand; and in like manner the unjust were\\nbidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand; these also\\nbore the symbols of their deeds, but fastened on their backs. he drew\\nnear, and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry\\nthe report of the other world to men, and they bade him hear and see\\nall that was to be heard and seen in that place. then he beheld and saw\\non one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth\\nwhen sentence had been given on them; and at the two other openings\\nother souls, some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with\\ntravel, some descending out of heaven clean and bright. and arriving\\never and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey, and they\\nwent forth with gladness into the meadow, where they encamped as at a\\nfestival; and those who knew one another embraced and conversed, the\\nsouls which came from earth curiously enquiring about the things above,\\nand the souls which came from heaven about the things beneath. and they\\ntold one another of what had happened by the way, those from below\\nweeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of the things which they had\\nendured and seen in their journey beneath the earth (now the journey\\nlasted a thousand years), while those from above were describing\\nheavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty. the story,\\nglaucon, would take too long to tell; but the sum was this:—he said\\nthat for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered\\ntenfold; or once in a hundred years—such being reckoned to be the\\nlength of man’s life, and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a\\nthousand years. if, for example, there were any who had been the cause\\nof many deaths, or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies, or been\\nguilty of any other evil behaviour, for each and all of their offences\\nthey received punishment ten times over, and the rewards of beneficence\\nand justice and holiness were in the same proportion. i need hardly\\nrepeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon as\\nthey were born. of piety and impiety to gods and parents, and of\\nmurderers, there were retributions other and greater far which he\\ndescribed. he mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits\\nasked another, ‘where is ardiaeus the great?’ (now this ardiaeus lived\\na thousand years before the time of er: he had been the tyrant of some\\ncity of pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and his elder\\nbrother, and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes.)\\nthe answer of the other spirit was: ‘he comes not hither and will never\\ncome. and this,’ said he, ‘was one of the dreadful sights which we\\nourselves witnessed. we were at the mouth of the cavern, and, having\\ncompleted all our experiences, were about to reascend, when of a sudden\\nardiaeus appeared and several others, most of whom were tyrants; and\\nthere were also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been\\ngreat criminals: they were just, as they fancied, about to return into\\nthe upper world, but the mouth, instead of admitting them, gave a roar,\\nwhenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had not been\\nsufficiently punished tried to ascend; and then wild men of fiery\\naspect, who were standing by and heard the sound, seized and carried\\nthem off; and ardiaeus and others they bound head and foot and hand,\\nand threw them down and flayed them with scourges, and dragged them\\nalong the road at the side, carding them on thorns like wool, and\\ndeclaring to the passers-by what were their crimes, and that they were\\nbeing taken away to be cast into hell.’ and of all the many terrors\\nwhich they had endured, he said that there was none like the terror\\nwhich each of them felt at that moment, lest they should hear the\\nvoice; and when there was silence, one by one they ascended with\\nexceeding joy. these, said er, were the penalties and retributions, and\\nthere were blessings as great.\\n\\nnow when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days,\\non the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey, and, on\\nthe fourth day after, he said that they came to a place where they\\ncould see from above a line of light, straight as a column, extending\\nright through the whole heaven and through the earth, in colour\\nresembling the rainbow, only brighter and purer; another day’s journey\\nbrought them to the place, and there, in the midst of the light, they\\nsaw the ends of the chains of heaven let down from above: for this\\nlight is the belt of heaven, and holds together the circle of the\\nuniverse, like the under-girders of a trireme. from these ends is\\nextended the spindle of necessity, on which all the revolutions turn.\\nthe shaft and hook of this spindle are made of steel, and the whorl is\\nmade partly of steel and also partly of other materials. now the whorl\\nis in form like the whorl used on earth; and the description of it\\nimplied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped\\nout, and into this is fitted another lesser one, and another, and\\nanother, and four others, making eight in all, like vessels which fit\\ninto one another; the whorls show their edges on the upper side, and on\\ntheir lower side all together form one continuous whorl. this is\\npierced by the spindle, which is driven home through the centre of the\\neighth. the first and outermost whorl has the rim broadest, and the\\nseven inner whorls are narrower, in the following proportions—the sixth\\nis next to the first in size, the fourth next to the sixth; then comes\\nthe eighth; the seventh is fifth, the fifth is sixth, the third is\\nseventh, last and eighth comes the second. the largest (or fixed stars)\\nis spangled, and the seventh (or sun) is brightest; the eighth (or\\nmoon) coloured by the reflected light of the seventh; the second and\\nfifth (saturn and mercury) are in colour like one another, and yellower\\nthan the preceding; the third (venus) has the whitest light; the fourth\\n(mars) is reddish; the sixth (jupiter) is in whiteness second. now the\\nwhole spindle has the same motion; but, as the whole revolves in one\\ndirection, the seven inner circles move slowly in the other, and of\\nthese the swiftest is the eighth; next in swiftness are the seventh,\\nsixth, and fifth, which move together; third in swiftness appeared to\\nmove according to the law of this reversed motion the fourth; the third\\nappeared fourth and the second fifth. the spindle turns on the knees of\\nnecessity; and on the upper surface of each circle is a siren, who goes\\nround with them, hymning a single tone or note. the eight together form\\none harmony; and round about, at equal intervals, there is another\\nband, three in number, each sitting upon her throne: these are the\\nfates, daughters of necessity, who are clothed in white robes and have\\nchaplets upon their heads, lachesis and clotho and atropos, who\\naccompany with their voices the harmony of the sirens—lachesis singing\\nof the past, clotho of the present, atropos of the future; clotho from\\ntime to time assisting with a touch of her right hand the revolution of\\nthe outer circle of the whorl or spindle, and atropos with her left\\nhand touching and guiding the inner ones, and lachesis laying hold of\\neither in turn, first with one hand and then with the other.\\n\\nwhen er and the spirits arrived, their duty was to go at once to\\nlachesis; but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in\\norder; then he took from the knees of lachesis lots and samples of\\nlives, and having mounted a high pulpit, spoke as follows: ‘hear the\\nword of lachesis, the daughter of necessity. mortal souls, behold a new\\ncycle of life and mortality. your genius will not be allotted to you,\\nbut you will choose your genius; and let him who draws the first lot\\nhave the first choice, and the life which he chooses shall be his\\ndestiny. virtue is free, and as a man honours or dishonours her he will\\nhave more or less of her; the responsibility is with the chooser—god is\\njustified.’ when the interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots\\nindifferently among them all, and each of them took up the lot which\\nfell near him, all but er himself (he was not allowed), and each as he\\ntook his lot perceived the number which he had obtained. then the\\ninterpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives; and\\nthere were many more lives than the souls present, and they were of all\\nsorts. there were lives of every animal and of man in every condition.\\nand there were tyrannies among them, some lasting out the tyrant’s\\nlife, others which broke off in the middle and came to an end in\\npoverty and exile and beggary; and there were lives of famous men, some\\nwho were famous for their form and beauty as well as for their strength\\nand success in games, or, again, for their birth and the qualities of\\ntheir ancestors; and some who were the reverse of famous for the\\nopposite qualities. and of women likewise; there was not, however, any\\ndefinite character in them, because the soul, when choosing a new life,\\nmust of necessity become different. but there was every other quality,\\nand the all mingled with one another, and also with elements of wealth\\nand poverty, and disease and health; and there were mean states also.\\nand here, my dear glaucon, is the supreme peril of our human state; and\\ntherefore the utmost care should be taken. let each one of us leave\\nevery other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one thing only, if\\nperadventure he may be able to learn and may find some one who will\\nmake him able to learn and discern between good and evil, and so to\\nchoose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity. he\\nshould consider the bearing of all these things which have been\\nmentioned severally and collectively upon virtue; he should know what\\nthe effect of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a\\nparticular soul, and what are the good and evil consequences of noble\\nand humble birth, of private and public station, of strength and\\nweakness, of cleverness and dullness, and of all the natural and\\nacquired gifts of the soul, and the operation of them when conjoined;\\nhe will then look at the nature of the soul, and from the consideration\\nof all these qualities he will be able to determine which is the better\\nand which is the worse; and so he will choose, giving the name of evil\\nto the life which will make his soul more unjust, and good to the life\\nwhich will make his soul more just; all else he will disregard. for we\\nhave seen and know that this is the best choice both in life and after\\ndeath. a man must take with him into the world below an adamantine\\nfaith in truth and right, that there too he may be undazzled by the\\ndesire of wealth or the other allurements of evil, lest, coming upon\\ntyrannies and similar villainies, he do irremediable wrongs to others\\nand suffer yet worse himself; but let him know how to choose the mean\\nand avoid the extremes on either side, as far as possible, not only in\\nthis life but in all that which is to come. for this is the way of\\nhappiness.\\n\\nand according to the report of the messenger from the other world this\\nwas what the prophet said at the time: ‘even for the last comer, if he\\nchooses wisely and will live diligently, there is appointed a happy and\\nnot undesirable existence. let not him who chooses first be careless,\\nand let not the last despair.’ and when he had spoken, he who had the\\nfirst choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny;\\nhis mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality, he had not\\nthought out the whole matter before he chose, and did not at first\\nsight perceive that he was fated, among other evils, to devour his own\\nchildren. but when he had time to reflect, and saw what was in the lot,\\nhe began to beat his breast and lament over his choice, forgetting the\\nproclamation of the prophet; for, instead of throwing the blame of his\\nmisfortune on himself, he accused chance and the gods, and everything\\nrather than himself. now he was one of those who came from heaven, and\\nin a former life had dwelt in a well-ordered state, but his virtue was\\na matter of habit only, and he had no philosophy. and it was true of\\nothers who were similarly overtaken, that the greater number of them\\ncame from heaven and therefore they had never been schooled by trial,\\nwhereas the pilgrims who came from earth having themselves suffered and\\nseen others suffer, were not in a hurry to choose. and owing to this\\ninexperience of theirs, and also because the lot was a chance, many of\\nthe souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an evil for a good.\\nfor if a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated himself\\nfrom the first to sound philosophy, and had been moderately fortunate\\nin the number of the lot, he might, as the messenger reported, be happy\\nhere, and also his journey to another life and return to this, instead\\nof being rough and underground, would be smooth and heavenly. most\\ncurious, he said, was the spectacle—sad and laughable and strange; for\\nthe choice of the souls was in most cases based on their experience of\\na previous life. there he saw the soul which had once been orpheus\\nchoosing the life of a swan out of enmity to the race of women, hating\\nto be born of a woman because they had been his murderers; he beheld\\nalso the soul of thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale; birds, on\\nthe other hand, like the swan and other musicians, wanting to be men.\\nthe soul which obtained the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion, and\\nthis was the soul of ajax the son of telamon, who would not be a man,\\nremembering the injustice which was done him in the judgment about the\\narms. the next was agamemnon, who took the life of an eagle, because,\\nlike ajax, he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings. about the\\nmiddle came the lot of atalanta; she, seeing the great fame of an\\nathlete, was unable to resist the temptation: and after her there\\nfollowed the soul of epeus the son of panopeus passing into the nature\\nof a woman cunning in the arts; and far away among the last who chose,\\nthe soul of the jester thersites was putting on the form of a monkey.\\nthere came also the soul of odysseus having yet to make a choice, and\\nhis lot happened to be the last of them all. now the recollection of\\nformer toils had disenchanted him of ambition, and he went about for a\\nconsiderable time in search of the life of a private man who had no\\ncares; he had some difficulty in finding this, which was lying about\\nand had been neglected by everybody else; and when he saw it, he said\\nthat he would have done the same had his lot been first instead of\\nlast, and that he was delighted to have it. and not only did men pass\\ninto animals, but i must also mention that there were animals tame and\\nwild who changed into one another and into corresponding human\\nnatures—the good into the gentle and the evil into the savage, in all\\nsorts of combinations.\\n\\nall the souls had now chosen their lives, and they went in the order of\\ntheir choice to lachesis, who sent with them the genius whom they had\\nseverally chosen, to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller\\nof the choice: this genius led the souls first to clotho, and drew them\\nwithin the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand, thus\\nratifying the destiny of each; and then, when they were fastened to\\nthis, carried them to atropos, who spun the threads and made them\\nirreversible, whence without turning round they passed beneath the\\nthrone of necessity; and when they had all passed, they marched on in a\\nscorching heat to the plain of forgetfulness, which was a barren waste\\ndestitute of trees and verdure; and then towards evening they encamped\\nby the river of unmindfulness, whose water no vessel can hold; of this\\nthey were all obliged to drink a certain quantity, and those who were\\nnot saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary; and each one as he\\ndrank forgot all things. now after they had gone to rest, about the\\nmiddle of the night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake, and then\\nin an instant they were driven upwards in all manner of ways to their\\nbirth, like stars shooting. he himself was hindered from drinking the\\nwater. but in what manner or by what means he returned to the body he\\ncould not say; only, in the morning, awaking suddenly, he found himself\\nlying on the pyre.\\n\\nand thus, glaucon, the tale has been saved and has not perished, and\\nwill save us if we are obedient to the word spoken; and we shall pass\\nsafely over the river of forgetfulness and our soul will not be\\ndefiled. wherefore my counsel is, that we hold fast ever to the\\nheavenly way and follow after justice and virtue always, considering\\nthat the soul is immortal and able to endure every sort of good and\\nevery sort of evil. thus shall we live dear to one another and to the\\ngods, both while remaining here and when, like conquerors in the games\\nwho go round to gather gifts, we receive our reward. and it shall be\\nwell with us both in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand\\nyears which we have been describing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*** end of the project gutenberg ebook the republic ***\\n\\nupdated

the\\ndivision of the mind into the rational   concupiscent   and irascible\\nelements   or of pleasures and desires into necessary and\\nunnecessary—these and other great forms of thought are all of them to\\nbe found in the republic   and were probably first invented by plato  \\nthe greatest of all logical truths   and the one of which writers on\\nphilosophy are most apt to lose sight   the difference between words and\\nthings   has been most strenuously insisted on by him   cp   rep     polit    \\ncratyl   435   436 ff     although he has not always avoided the confusion\\nof them in his own writings   e  g   rep       but he does not bind up truth\\nin logical formulae  —logic is still veiled in metaphysics   and the\\nscience which he imagines to   contemplate all truth and all existence  \\nis very unlike the doctrine of the syllogism which aristotle claims to\\nhave discovered   soph   elenchi   33   18    \\n\\nneither must we forget that the republic is but the third part of a\\nstill larger design which was to have included an ideal history of\\nathens   as well as a political and physical philosophy   the fragment of\\nthe critias has given birth to a world  famous fiction   second only in\\nimportance to the tale of troy and the legend of arthur   and is said as\\na fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of the sixteenth\\ncentury   this mythical tale   of which the subject was a history of the\\nwars of the athenians against the island of atlantis   is supposed to be\\nfounded upon an unfinished poem of solon   to which it would have stood\\nin the same relation as the writings of the logographers to the poems\\nof homer   it would have told of a struggle for liberty   cp   tim   25 c    \\nintended to represent the conflict of persia and hellas   we may judge\\nfrom the noble commencement of the timaeus   from the fragment of the\\ncritias itself   and from the third book of the laws   in what manner\\nplato would have treated this high argument   we can only guess why the\\ngreat design was abandoned   perhaps because plato became sensible of\\nsome incongruity in a fictitious history   or because he had lost his\\ninterest in it   or because advancing years forbade the completion of\\nit   and we may please ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary\\nnarrative ever been finished   we should have found plato himself\\nsympathising with the struggle for hellenic independence   cp   laws  \\niii   698 ff       singing a hymn of triumph over marathon and salamis  \\nperhaps making the reflection of herodotus   v   78   where he\\ncontemplates the growth of the athenian empire—  how brave a thing is\\nfreedom of speech   which has made the athenians so far exceed every\\nother state of hellas in greatness     or   more probably   attributing the\\nvictory to the ancient good order of athens and to the favor of apollo\\nand athene   cp   introd   to critias    \\n\\nagain   plato may be regarded as the   captain       arhchegoz     or leader\\nof a goodly band of followers   for in the republic is to be found the\\noriginal of cicero  s de republica   of st   augustine  s city of god   of\\nthe utopia of sir thomas more   and of the numerous other imaginary\\nstates which are framed upon the same model   the extent to which\\naristotle or the aristotelian school were indebted to him in the\\npolitics has been little recognised   and the recognition is the more\\nnecessary because it is not made by aristotle himself   the two\\nphilosophers had more in common than they were conscious of   and\\nprobably some elements of plato remain still undetected in aristotle  \\nin english philosophy too   many affinities may be traced   not only in\\nthe works of the cambridge platonists   but in great original writers\\nlike berkeley or coleridge   to plato and his ideas   that there is a\\ntruth higher than experience   of which the mind bears witness to\\nherself   is a conviction which in our own generation has been\\nenthusiastically asserted   and is perhaps gaining ground   of the greek\\nauthors who at the renaissance brought a new life into the world plato\\nhas had the greatest influence   the republic of plato is also the first\\ntreatise upon education   of which the writings of milton and locke  \\nrousseau   jean paul   and goethe are the legitimate descendants   like\\ndante or bunyan   he has a revelation of another life   like bacon   he is\\nprofoundly impressed with the unity of knowledge   in the early church\\nhe exercised a

thinkers and statesmen   such as the\\nunity of knowledge   the reign of law   and the equality of the sexes  \\nhave been anticipated in a dream by him  \\n\\nthe argument of the republic is the search after justice   the nature of\\nwhich is first hinted at by cephalus   the just and blameless old\\nman—then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by socrates and\\npolemarchus—then caricatured by thrasymachus and partially explained by\\nsocrates—reduced to an abstraction by glaucon and adeimantus   and\\nhaving become invisible in the individual reappears at length in the\\nideal state which is constructed by socrates   the first care of the\\nrulers is to be education   of which an outline is drawn after the old\\nhellenic model   providing only for an improved religion and morality  \\nand more simplicity in music and gymnastic   a manlier strain of poetry  \\nand greater harmony of the individual and the state   we are thus led on\\nto the conception of a higher state   in which   no man calls anything\\nhis own     and in which there is neither   marrying nor giving in\\nmarriage     and   kings are philosophers   and   philosophers are kings    \\nand there is another and higher education   intellectual as well as\\nmoral and religious   of science as well as of art   and not of youth\\nonly but of the whole of life   such a state is hardly to be realized in\\nthis world and quickly degenerates   to the perfect ideal succeeds the\\ngovernment of the soldier and the lover of honour   this again declining\\ninto democracy   and democracy into tyranny   in an imaginary but regular\\norder having not much resemblance to the actual facts   when   the wheel\\nhas come full circle   we do not begin again with a new period of human\\nlife   but we have passed from the best to the worst   and there we end  \\nthe subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry and\\nphilosophy which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books of\\nthe republic is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion   poetry is\\ndiscovered to be an imitation thrice removed from the truth   and homer  \\nas well as the dramatic poets   having been condemned as an imitator   is\\nsent into banishment along with them   and the idea of the state is\\nsupplemented by the revelation of a future life  \\n\\nthe division into books   like all similar divisions   cp   sir g  c   lewis\\nin the classical museum   vol   ii   p 1       is probably later than the age\\nof plato   the natural divisions are five in number  —  1   book i and the\\nfirst half of book ii down to the paragraph beginning     i had always\\nadmired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus     which is introductory  \\nthe first book containing a refutation of the popular and sophistical\\nnotions of justice   and concluding   like some of the earlier dialogues  \\nwithout arriving at any definite result   to this is appended a\\nrestatement of the nature of justice according to common opinion   and\\nan answer is demanded to the question—what is justice   stripped of\\nappearances   the second division   2   includes the remainder of the\\nsecond and the whole of the third and fourth books   which are mainly\\noccupied with the construction of the first state and the first\\neducation   the third division   3   consists of the fifth   sixth   and\\nseventh books   in which philosophy rather than justice is the subject\\nof enquiry   and the second state is constructed on principles of\\ncommunism and ruled by philosophers   and the contemplation of the idea\\nof good takes the place of the social and political virtues   in the\\neighth and ninth books   4   the perversions of states and of the\\nindividuals who correspond to them are reviewed in succession   and the\\nnature of pleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analysed in\\nthe individual man   the tenth book   5   is the conclusion of the whole  \\nin which the relations of philosophy to poetry are finally determined  \\nand the happiness of the citizens in this life   which has now been\\nassured   is crowned by the vision of another  \\n\\nor a more general division into two parts may be adopted   the first\\n  books i    iv   containing the description of a state framed generally\\nin accordance with hellenic notions of religion and morality   while in\\nthe second   books v    x   the hellenic state is transformed into an\\nideal kingdom of philosophy   of which all other governments are the\\nperversions   these two points of view are really opposed   and the\\nopposition is only veiled by the genius of plato   the republic   like\\nthe phaedrus   see introduction to phaedrus     is an imperfect whole   the\\nhigher light of philosophy breaks through the regularity of the\\nhellenic temple   which at last fades away into the heavens   whether\\nthis imperfection of structure arises from an enlargement of the plan  \\nor from the imperfect reconcilement in the writer  s own mind of the\\nstruggling elements of thought which are now first brought together by\\nhim   or   perhaps   from the composition of the work at different\\ntimes—are questions   like the similar question about the iliad and the\\nodyssey   which are worth asking   but which cannot have a distinct\\nanswer   in the age of plato there was no regular mode of publication  \\nand an author would have the less scruple in altering or adding to a\\nwork which was known only to a few of his friends   there is no\\nabsurdity in supposing that he may have laid his labours aside for a\\ntime   or turned from one work to another   and such interruptions would\\nbe more likely to occur in the case of a long than of a short writing  \\nin all attempts to determine the chronological order of the platonic\\nwritings on internal evidence   this uncertainty about any single\\ndialogue being composed at one time is a disturbing element   which must\\nbe admitted to affect longer works   such as the republic and the laws  \\nmore than shorter ones   but   on the other hand   the seeming\\ndiscrepancies of the republic may only arise out of the discordant\\nelements which the philosopher has attempted to unite in a single\\nwhole   perhaps without being himself able to recognise the\\ninconsistency which is obvious to us   for there is a judgment of after\\nages which few great writers have ever been able to anticipate for\\nthemselves   they do not perceive the want of connexion in their own\\nwritings   or the gaps in their systems which are visible enough to\\nthose who come after them   in the beginnings of literature and\\nphilosophy   amid the first efforts of thought and language   more\\ninconsistencies occur than now   when the paths of speculation are well\\nworn and the meaning of words precisely defined   for consistency   too  \\nis the growth of time   and some of the greatest creations of the human\\nmind have been wanting in unity   tried by this test   several of the\\nplatonic dialogues   according to our modern ideas   appear to be\\ndefective   but the deficiency is no proof that they were composed at\\ndifferent times or by different hands   and the supposition that the\\nrepublic was written uninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in\\nsome degree confirmed by the numerous references from one part of the\\nwork to another  \\n\\nthe second title     concerning justice     is not the one by which the\\nrepublic is quoted   either by aristotle or generally in antiquity   and  \\nlike the other second titles of the platonic dialogues   may therefore\\nbe assumed to be of later date   morgenstern and others have asked\\nwhether the definition of justice   which is the professed aim   or the\\nconstruction of the state is the principal argument of the work   the\\nanswer is   that the two blend in one   and are two faces of the same\\ntruth   for justice is the order of the state   and the state is the\\nvisible embodiment of justice under the conditions of human society  \\nthe one is the soul and the other is the body   and the greek ideal of\\nthe state   as of the individual   is a fair mind in a fair body   in\\nhegelian phraseology the state is the reality of which justice is the\\nidea   or   described in christian language   the kingdom of god is\\nwithin   and yet developes into a church or external kingdom     the house\\nnot made with hands   eternal in the heavens     is reduced to the\\nproportions of an earthly building   or   to use a platonic image  \\njustice and the state are the warp and the woof which run through the\\nwhole texture   and when the constitution of the state is completed   the\\nconception of justice is not dismissed   but reappears under the same or\\ndifferent names throughout the work   both as the inner law of the\\nindividual soul   and finally as the principle of rewards and\\npunishments in another life   the virtues are based on justice   of which\\ncommon honesty in buying and selling is the shadow   and justice is\\nbased on the idea of good   which is the harmony of the world   and is\\nreflected both in the institutions of states and in motions of the\\nheavenly bodies   cp   tim   47     the timaeus   which takes up the\\npolitical rather than the ethical side of the republic   and is chiefly\\noccupied with hypotheses concerning the outward world   yet contains\\nmany indications that the same law is supposed to reign over the state  \\nover nature   and over man  \\n\\ntoo much   however   has been made of this question both in ancient and\\nmodern times   there is a stage of criticism in which all works   whether\\nof nature or of art   are referred to design   now in ancient writings  \\nand indeed in literature generally   there remains often a large element\\nwhich was not comprehended in the original design   for the plan grows\\nunder the author  s hand   new thoughts occur to him in the act of\\nwriting   he has not worked out the argument to the end before he\\nbegins   the reader who seeks to find some one idea under which the\\nwhole may be conceived   must necessarily seize on the vaguest and most\\ngeneral   thus stallbaum   who is dissatisfied with the ordinary\\nexplanations of the argument of the republic   imagines himself to have\\nfound the true argument   in the representation of human life in a state\\nperfected by justice   and governed according to the idea of good    \\nthere may be some use in such general descriptions   but they can hardly\\nbe said to express the design of the writer   the truth is   that we may\\nas well speak of many designs as of one   nor need anything be excluded\\nfrom the plan of a great work to which the mind is naturally led by the\\nassociation of ideas   and which does not interfere with the general\\npurpose   what kind or degree of unity is to be sought after in a\\nbuilding   in the plastic arts   in poetry   in prose   is a problem which\\nhas to be determined relatively to the subject  matter   to plato\\nhimself   the enquiry   what was the intention of the writer     or   what\\nwas the principal argument of the republic   would have been hardly\\nintelligible   and therefore had better be at once dismissed   cp   the\\nintroduction to the phaedrus    \\n\\nis not the republic the vehicle of three or four great truths which   to\\nplato  s own mind   are most naturally represented in the form of the\\nstate   just as in the jewish prophets the reign of messiah   or   the day\\nof the lord     or the suffering servant or people of god   or the   sun of\\nrighteousness with healing in his wings   only convey   to us at least  \\ntheir great spiritual ideals   so through the greek state plato reveals\\nto us his own thoughts about divine perfection   which is the idea of\\ngood—like the sun in the visible world  —about human perfection   which\\nis justice—about education beginning in youth and continuing in later\\nyears—about poets and sophists and tyrants who are the false teachers\\nand evil rulers of mankind—about   the world   which is the embodiment of\\nthem—about a kingdom which exists nowhere upon earth but is laid up in\\nheaven to be the pattern and rule of human life   no such inspired\\ncreation is at unity with itself   any more than the clouds of heaven\\nwhen the sun pierces through them   every shade of light and dark   of\\ntruth   and of fiction which is the veil of truth   is allowable in a\\nwork of philosophical imagination   it is not all on the same plane   it\\neasily passes from ideas to myths and fancies   from facts to figures of\\nspeech   it is not prose but poetry   at least a great part of it   and\\nought not to be judged by the rules of logic or the probabilities of\\nhistory   the writer is not fashioning his ideas into an artistic whole  \\nthey take possession of him and are too much for him   we have no need\\ntherefore to discuss whether a state such as plato has conceived is\\npracticable or not   or whether the outward form or the inward life came\\nfirst into the mind of the writer   for the practicability of his ideas\\nhas nothing to do with their truth   and the highest thoughts to which\\nhe attains may be truly said to bear the greatest   marks of\\ndesign  —justice more than the external frame  work of the state   the\\nidea of good more than justice   the great science of dialectic or the\\norganisation of ideas has no real content   but is only a type of the\\nmethod or spirit in which the higher knowledge is to be pursued by the\\nspectator of all time and all existence   it is in the fifth   sixth   and\\nseventh books that plato reaches the   summit of speculation     and\\nthese   although they fail to satisfy the requirements of a modern\\nthinker   may therefore be regarded as the most important   as they are\\nalso the most original   portions of the work  \\n\\nit is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question which has\\nbeen raised by boeckh   respecting the imaginary date at which the\\nconversation was held   the year 411 b  c   which is proposed by him will\\ndo as well as any other     for a writer of fiction   and especially a\\nwriter who   like plato   is notoriously careless of chronology   cp  \\nrep     symp     193 a   etc       only aims at general probability   whether\\nall the persons mentioned in the republic could ever have met at any\\none time is not a difficulty which would have occurred to an athenian\\nreading the work forty years later   or to plato himself at the time of\\nwriting   any more than to shakespeare respecting one of his own\\ndramas     and need not greatly trouble us now   yet this may be a\\nquestion having no answer   which is still worth asking     because the\\ninvestigation shows that we cannot argue historically from the dates in\\nplato   it would be useless therefore to waste time in inventing\\nfar  fetched reconcilements of them in order to avoid chronological\\ndifficulties   such   for example   as the conjecture of c  f   hermann  \\nthat glaucon and adeimantus are not the brothers but the uncles of\\nplato   cp   apol   34 a     or the fancy of stallbaum that plato\\nintentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates at which some of\\nhis dialogues were written  \\n\\nthe principal characters in the republic are cephalus   polemarchus  \\nthrasymachus   socrates   glaucon   and adeimantus   cephalus appears in\\nthe introduction only   polemarchus drops at the end of the first\\nargument   and thrasymachus is reduced to silence at the close of the\\nfirst book   the main discussion is carried on by socrates   glaucon   and\\nadeimantus   among the company are lysias   the orator   and euthydemus  \\nthe sons of cephalus and brothers of polemarchus   an unknown\\ncharmantides—these are mute auditors   also there is cleitophon   who\\nonce interrupts   where   as in the dialogue which bears his name   he\\nappears as the friend and ally of thrasymachus  \\n\\ncephalus   the patriarch of the house   has been appropriately engaged in\\noffering a sacrifice   he is the pattern of an old man who has almost\\ndone with life   and is at peace with himself and with all mankind   he\\nfeels that he is drawing nearer to the world below   and seems to linger\\naround the memory of the past   he is eager that socrates should come to\\nvisit him   fond of the poetry of the last generation   happy in the\\nconsciousness of a well  spent life   glad at having escaped from the\\ntyranny of youthful lusts   his love of conversation   his affection   his\\nindifference to riches   even his garrulity   are interesting traits of\\ncharacter   he is not one of those who have nothing to say   because\\ntheir whole mind has been absorbed in making money   yet he acknowledges\\nthat riches have the advantage of placing men above the temptation to\\ndishonesty or falsehood   the respectful attention shown to him by\\nsocrates   whose love of conversation   no less than the mission imposed\\nupon him by the oracle   leads him to ask questions of all men   young\\nand old alike   should also be noted   who better suited to raise the\\nquestion of justice than cephalus   whose life might seem to be the\\nexpression of it   the moderation with which old age is pictured by\\ncephalus as a very tolerable portion of existence is characteristic  \\nnot only of him   but of greek feeling generally   and contrasts with the\\nexaggeration of cicero in the de senectute   the evening of life is\\ndescribed by plato in the most expressive manner   yet with the fewest\\npossible touches   as cicero remarks   ep   ad attic   iv   16     the aged\\ncephalus would have been out of place in the discussion which follows  \\nand which he could neither have understood nor taken part in without a\\nviolation of dramatic propriety   cp   lysimachus in the laches    \\n\\nhis   son and heir   polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousness of\\nyouth   he is for detaining socrates by force in the opening scene   and\\nwill not   let him off   on the subject of women and children   like\\ncephalus   he is limited in his point of view   and represents the\\nproverbial stage of morality which has rules of life rather than\\nprinciples   and he quotes simonides   cp   aristoph   clouds   as his\\nfather had quoted pindar   but after this he has no more to say   the\\nanswers which he makes are only elicited from him by the dialectic of\\nsocrates   he has not yet experienced the influence of the sophists like\\nglaucon and adeimantus   nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting\\nthem   he belongs to the pre  socratic or pre  dialectical age   he is\\nincapable of arguing   and is bewildered by socrates to such a degree\\nthat he does not know what he is saying   he is made to admit that\\njustice is a thief   and that the virtues follow the analogy of the\\narts   from his brother lysias   contra eratosth     we learn that he fell\\na victim to the thirty tyrants   but no allusion is here made to his\\nfate   nor to the circumstance that cephalus and his family were of\\nsyracusan origin   and had migrated from thurii to athens  \\n\\nthe   chalcedonian giant     thrasymachus   of whom we have already heard\\nin the phaedrus   is the personification of the sophists   according to\\nplato  s conception of them   in some of their worst characteristics   he\\nis vain and blustering   refusing to discourse unless he is paid   fond\\nof making an oration   and hoping thereby to escape the inevitable\\nsocrates   but a mere child in argument   and unable to foresee that the\\nnext   move     to use a platonic expression   will   shut him up     he has\\nreached the stage of framing general notions   and in this respect is in\\nadvance of cephalus and polemarchus   but he is incapable of defending\\nthem in a discussion   and vainly tries to cover his confusion with\\nbanter and insolence   whether such doctrines as are attributed to him\\nby plato were really held either by him or by any other sophist is\\nuncertain   in the infancy of philosophy serious errors about morality\\nmight easily grow up—they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers\\nin thucydides   but we are concerned at present with plato  s description\\nof him   and not with the historical reality   the inequality of the\\ncontest adds greatly to the humour of the scene   the pompous and empty\\nsophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great master of\\ndialectic   who knows how to touch all the springs of vanity and\\nweakness in him   he is greatly irritated by the irony of socrates   but\\nhis noisy and imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to the\\nthrusts of his assailant   his determination to cram down their throats  \\nor put   bodily into their souls   his own words   elicits a cry of horror\\nfrom socrates   the state of his temper is quite as worthy of remark as\\nthe process of the argument   nothing is more amusing than his complete\\nsubmission when he has been once thoroughly beaten   at first he seems\\nto continue the discussion with reluctance   but soon with apparent\\ngood  will   and he even testifies his interest at a later stage by one\\nor two occasional remarks   when attacked by glaucon he is humorously\\nprotected by socrates   as one who has never been his enemy and is now\\nhis friend     from cicero and quintilian and from aristotle  s rhetoric\\nwe learn that the sophist whom plato has made so ridiculous was a man\\nof note whose writings were preserved in later ages   the play on his\\nname which was made by his contemporary herodicus   aris   rhet         thou\\nwast ever bold in battle     seems to show that the description of him is\\nnot devoid of verisimilitude  \\n\\nwhen thrasymachus has been silenced   the two principal respondents  \\nglaucon and adeimantus   appear on the scene   here   as in greek tragedy\\n  cp   introd   to phaedo     three actors are introduced   at first sight\\nthe two sons of ariston may seem to wear a family likeness   like the\\ntwo friends simmias and cebes in the phaedo   but on a nearer\\nexamination of them the similarity vanishes   and they are seen to be\\ndistinct characters   glaucon is the impetuous youth who can   just never\\nhave enough of fechting     cp   the character of him in xen   mem   iii  \\n6     the man of pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries of love  \\nthe   juvenis qui gaudet canibus     and who improves the breed of\\nanimals   the lover of art and music who has all the experiences of\\nyouthful life   he is full of quickness and penetration   piercing easily\\nbelow the clumsy platitudes of thrasymachus to the real difficulty   he\\nturns out to the light the seamy side of human life   and yet does not\\nlose faith in the just and true   it is glaucon who seizes what may be\\ntermed the ludicrous relation of the philosopher to the world   to whom\\na state of simplicity is   a city of pigs     who is always prepared with\\na jest when the argument offers him an opportunity   and who is ever\\nready to second the humour of socrates and to appreciate the\\nridiculous   whether in the connoisseurs of music   or in the lovers of\\ntheatricals   or in the fantastic behaviour of the citizens of\\ndemocracy   his weaknesses are several times alluded to by socrates  \\nwho   however   will not allow him to be attacked by his brother\\nadeimantus   he is a soldier   and   like adeimantus   has been\\ndistinguished at the battle of megara   anno 456          the character of\\nadeimantus is deeper and graver   and the profounder objections are\\ncommonly put into his mouth   glaucon is more demonstrative   and\\ngenerally opens the game   adeimantus pursues the argument further  \\nglaucon has more of the liveliness and quick sympathy of youth  \\nadeimantus has the maturer judgment of a grown  up man of the world   in\\nthe second book   when glaucon insists that justice and injustice shall\\nbe considered without regard to their consequences   adeimantus remarks\\nthat they are regarded by mankind in general only for the sake of their\\nconsequences   and in a similar vein of reflection he urges at the\\nbeginning of the fourth book that socrates fails in making his citizens\\nhappy   and is answered that happiness is not the first but the second\\nthing   not the direct aim but the indirect consequence of the good\\ngovernment of a state   in the discussion about religion and mythology  \\nadeimantus is the respondent   but glaucon breaks in with a slight jest  \\nand carries on the conversation in a lighter tone about music and\\ngymnastic to the end of the book   it is adeimantus again who volunteers\\nthe criticism of common sense on the socratic method of argument   and\\nwho refuses to let socrates pass lightly over the question of women and\\nchildren   it is adeimantus who is the respondent in the more\\nargumentative   as glaucon in the lighter and more imaginative portions\\nof the dialogue   for example   throughout the greater part of the sixth\\nbook   the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the conception of\\nthe idea of good are discussed with adeimantus   glaucon resumes his\\nplace of principal respondent   but he has a difficulty in apprehending\\nthe higher education of socrates   and makes some false hits in the\\ncourse of the discussion   once more adeimantus returns with the\\nallusion to his brother glaucon whom he compares to the contentious\\nstate   in the next book he is again superseded   and glaucon continues\\nto the end  \\n\\nthus in a succession of characters plato represents the successive\\nstages of morality   beginning with the athenian gentleman of the olden\\ntime   who is followed by the practical man of that day regulating his\\nlife by proverbs and saws   to him succeeds the wild generalization of\\nthe sophists   and lastly come the young disciples of the great teacher  \\nwho know the sophistical arguments but will not be convinced by them  \\nand desire to go deeper into the nature of things   these too   like\\ncephalus   polemarchus   thrasymachus   are clearly distinguished from one\\nanother   neither in the republic   nor in any other dialogue of plato  \\nis a single character repeated  \\n\\nthe delineation of socrates in the republic is not wholly consistent  \\nin the first book we have more of the real socrates   such as he is\\ndepicted in the memorabilia of xenophon   in the earliest dialogues of\\nplato   and in the apology   he is ironical   provoking   questioning   the\\nold enemy of the sophists   ready to put on the mask of silenus as well\\nas to argue seriously   but in the sixth book his enmity towards the\\nsophists abates   he acknowledges that they are the representatives\\nrather than the corrupters of the world   he also becomes more dogmatic\\nand constructive   passing beyond the range either of the political or\\nthe speculative ideas of the real socrates   in one passage plato\\nhimself seems to intimate that the time had now come for socrates   who\\nhad passed his whole life in philosophy   to give his own opinion and\\nnot to be always repeating the notions of other men   there is no\\nevidence that either the idea of good or the conception of a perfect\\nstate were comprehended in the socratic teaching   though he certainly\\ndwelt on the nature of the universal and of final causes   cp   xen  \\nmem     phaedo     and a deep thinker like him   in his thirty or forty\\nyears of public teaching   could hardly have failed to touch on the\\nnature of family relations   for which there is also some positive\\nevidence in the memorabilia   mem     the socratic method is nominally\\nretained   and every inference is either put into the mouth of the\\nrespondent or represented as the common discovery of him and socrates  \\nbut any one can see that this is a mere form   of which the affectation\\ngrows wearisome as the work advances   the method of enquiry has passed\\ninto a method of teaching in which by the help of interlocutors the\\nsame thesis is looked at from various points of view   the nature of the\\nprocess is truly characterized by glaucon   when he describes himself as\\na companion who is not good for much in an investigation   but can see\\nwhat he is shown   and may   perhaps   give the answer to a question more\\nfluently than another  \\n\\nneither can we be absolutely certain that socrates himself taught the\\nimmortality of the soul   which is unknown to his disciple glaucon in\\nthe republic   cp   apol       nor is there any reason to suppose that he\\nused myths or revelations of another world as a vehicle of instruction  \\nor that he would have banished poetry or have denounced the greek\\nmythology   his favorite oath is retained   and a slight mention is made\\nof the daemonium   or internal sign   which is alluded to by socrates as\\na phenomenon peculiar to himself   a real element of socratic teaching  \\nwhich is more prominent in the republic than in any of the other\\ndialogues of plato   is the use of example and illustration τὰ φορτικὰ\\nαὐτῷ προσφέροντες     let us apply the test of common instances       you    \\nsays adeimantus   ironically   in the sixth book     are so unaccustomed to\\nspeak in images     and this use of examples or images   though truly\\nsocratic in origin   is enlarged by the genius of plato into the form of\\nan allegory or parable   which embodies in the concrete what has been\\nalready described   or is about to be described   in the abstract   thus\\nthe figure of the cave in book vii is a recapitulation of the divisions\\nof knowledge in book vi   the composite animal in book ix is an allegory\\nof the parts of the soul   the noble captain and the ship and the true\\npilot in book vi are a figure of the relation of the people to the\\nphilosophers in the state which has been described   other figures   such\\nas the dog   or the marriage of the portionless maiden   or the drones\\nand wasps in the eighth and ninth books   also form links of connexion\\nin long passages   or are used to recall previous discussions  \\n\\nplato is most true to the character of his master when he describes him\\nas   not of this world     and with this representation of him the ideal\\nstate and the other paradoxes of the republic are quite in accordance  \\nthough they cannot be shown to have been speculations of socrates   to\\nhim   as to other great teachers both philosophical and religious   when\\nthey looked upward   the world seemed to be the embodiment of error and\\nevil   the common sense of mankind has revolted against this view   or\\nhas only partially admitted it   and even in socrates himself the\\nsterner judgement of the multitude at times passes into a sort of\\nironical pity or love   men in general are incapable of philosophy   and\\nare therefore at enmity with the philosopher   but their\\nmisunderstanding of him is unavoidable   for they have never seen him as\\nhe truly is in his own image   they are only acquainted with artificial\\nsystems possessing no native force of truth—words which admit of many\\napplications   their leaders have nothing to measure with   and are\\ntherefore ignorant of their own stature   but they are to be pitied or\\nlaughed at   not to be quarrelled with   they mean well with their\\nnostrums   if they could only learn that they are cutting off a hydra  s\\nhead   this moderation towards those who are in error is one of the most\\ncharacteristic features of socrates in the republic   in all the\\ndifferent representations of socrates   whether of xenophon or plato  \\nand amid the differences of the earlier or later dialogues   he always\\nretains the character of the unwearied and disinterested seeker after\\ntruth   without which he would have ceased to be socrates  \\n\\nleaving the characters we may now analyse the contents of the republic  \\nand then proceed to consider   1   the general aspects of this hellenic\\nideal of the state     2   the modern lights in which the thoughts of\\nplato may be read  \\n\\nbook i   the republic opens with a truly greek scene—a festival in\\nhonour of the goddess bendis which is held in the piraeus   to this is\\nadded the promise of an equestrian torch  race in the evening   the whole\\nwork is supposed to be recited by socrates on the day after the\\nfestival to a small party   consisting of critias   timaeus   hermocrates  \\nand another   this we learn from the first words of the timaeus  \\n\\nwhen the rhetorical advantage of reciting the dialogue has been gained  \\nthe attention is not distracted by any reference to the audience   nor\\nis the reader further reminded of the extraordinary length of the\\nnarrative   of the numerous company   three only take any serious part in\\nthe discussion   nor are we informed whether in the evening they went to\\nthe torch  race   or talked   as in the symposium   through the night   the\\nmanner in which the conversation has arisen is described as\\nfollows  —socrates and his companion glaucon are about to leave the\\nfestival when they are detained by a message from polemarchus   who\\nspeedily appears accompanied by adeimantus   the brother of glaucon   and\\nwith playful violence compels them to remain   promising them not only\\nthe torch  race   but the pleasure of conversation with the young   which\\nto socrates is a far greater attraction   they return to the house of\\ncephalus   polemarchus   father   now in extreme old age   who is found\\nsitting upon a cushioned seat crowned for a sacrifice     you should come\\nto me oftener   socrates   for i am too old to go to you   and at my time\\nof life   having lost other pleasures   i care the more for\\nconversation     socrates asks him what he thinks of age   to which the\\nold man replies   that the sorrows and discontents of age are to be\\nattributed to the tempers of men   and that age is a time of peace in\\nwhich the tyranny of the passions is no longer felt   yes   replies\\nsocrates   but the world will say   cephalus   that you are happy in old\\nage because you are rich     and there is something in what they say  \\nsocrates   but not so much as they imagine—as themistocles replied to\\nthe seriphian     neither you   if you had been an athenian   nor i   if i\\nhad been a seriphian   would ever have been famous     i might in like\\nmanner reply to you   neither a good poor man can be happy in age   nor\\nyet a bad rich man     socrates remarks that cephalus appears not to care\\nabout riches   a quality which he ascribes to his having inherited   not\\nacquired them   and would like to know what he considers to be the chief\\nadvantage of them   cephalus answers that when you are old the belief in\\nthe world below grows upon you   and then to have done justice and never\\nto have been compelled to do injustice through poverty   and never to\\nhave deceived anyone   are felt to be unspeakable blessings   socrates  \\nwho is evidently preparing for an argument   next asks   what is the\\nmeaning of the word justice   to tell the truth and pay your debts   no\\nmore than this   or must we admit exceptions   ought i   for example   to\\nput back into the hands of my friend   who has gone mad   the sword which\\ni borrowed of him when he was in his right mind     there must be\\nexceptions       and yet     says polemarchus     the definition which has\\nbeen given has the authority of simonides     here cephalus retires to\\nlook after the sacrifices   and bequeaths   as socrates facetiously\\nremarks   the possession of the argument to his heir   polemarchus      \\n\\nthe description of old age is finished   and plato   as his manner is  \\nhas touched the key  note of the whole work in asking for the definition\\nof justice   first suggesting the question which glaucon afterwards\\npursues respecting external goods   and preparing for the concluding\\nmythus of the world below in the slight allusion of cephalus   the\\nportrait of the just man is a natural frontispiece or introduction to\\nthe long discourse which follows   and may perhaps imply that in all our\\nperplexity about the nature of justice   there is no difficulty in\\ndiscerning   who is a just man     the first explanation has been\\nsupported by a saying of simonides   and now socrates has a mind to show\\nthat the resolution of justice into two unconnected precepts   which\\nhave no common principle   fails to satisfy the demands of dialectic  \\n\\n      he proceeds   what did simonides mean by this saying of his   did he\\nmean that i was to give back arms to a madman     no   not in that case  \\nnot if the parties are friends   and evil would result   he meant that\\nyou were to do what was proper   good to friends and harm to enemies    \\nevery act does something to somebody   and following this analogy  \\nsocrates asks   what is this due and proper thing which justice does  \\nand to whom   he is answered that justice does good to friends and harm\\nto enemies   but in what way good or harm     in making alliances with the\\none   and going to war with the other     then in time of peace what is\\nthe good of justice   the answer is that justice is of use in contracts  \\nand contracts are money partnerships   yes   but how in such partnerships\\nis the just man of more use than any other man     when you want to have\\nmoney safely kept and not used     then justice will be useful when money\\nis useless   and there is another difficulty   justice   like the art of\\nwar or any other art   must be of opposites   good at attack as well as\\nat defence   at stealing as well as at guarding   but then justice is a\\nthief   though a hero notwithstanding   like autolycus   the homeric hero  \\nwho was   excellent above all men in theft and perjury  —to such a pass\\nhave you and homer and simonides brought us   though i do not forget\\nthat the thieving must be for the good of friends and the harm of\\nenemies   and still there arises another question   are friends to be\\ninterpreted as real or seeming   enemies as real or seeming   and are our\\nfriends to be only the good   and our enemies to be the evil   the answer\\nis   that we must do good to our seeming and real good friends   and evil\\nto our seeming and real evil enemies—good to the good   evil to the\\nevil   but ought we to render evil for evil at all   when to do so will\\nonly make men more evil   can justice produce injustice any more than\\nthe art of horsemanship can make bad horsemen   or heat produce cold  \\nthe final conclusion is   that no sage or poet ever said that the just\\nreturn evil for evil   this was a maxim of some rich and mighty man  \\nperiander   perdiccas   or ismenias the theban   about b  c   398  381        \\n\\nthus the first stage of aphoristic or unconscious morality is shown to\\nbe inadequate to the wants of the age   the authority of the poets is\\nset aside   and through the winding mazes of dialectic we make an\\napproach to the christian precept of forgiveness of injuries   similar\\nwords are applied by the persian mystic poet to the divine being when\\nthe questioning spirit is stirred within him  —  if because i do evil  \\nthou punishest me by evil   what is the difference between thee and me    \\nin this both plato and kheyam rise above the level of many christian\\n       theologians   the first definition of justice easily passes into the\\nsecond   for the simple words   to speak the truth and pay your debts   is\\nsubstituted the more abstract   to do good to your friends and harm to\\nyour enemies     either of these explanations gives a sufficient rule of\\nlife for plain men   but they both fall short of the precision of\\nphilosophy   we may note in passing the antiquity of casuistry   which\\nnot only arises out of the conflict of established principles in\\nparticular cases   but also out of the effort to attain them   and is\\nprior as well as posterior to our fundamental notions of morality   the\\n  interrogation   of moral ideas   the appeal to the authority of homer  \\nthe conclusion that the maxim     do good to your friends and harm to\\nyour enemies     being erroneous   could not have been the word of any\\ngreat man   are all of them very characteristic of the platonic\\nsocrates  \\n\\n      here thrasymachus   who has made several attempts to interrupt   but\\nhas hitherto been kept in order by the company   takes advantage of a\\npause and rushes into the arena   beginning   like a savage animal   with\\na roar     socrates     he says     what folly is this  —why do you agree to\\nbe vanquished by one another in a pretended argument     he then\\nprohibits all the ordinary definitions of justice   to which socrates\\nreplies that he cannot tell how many twelve is   if he is forbidden to\\nsay 2 x 6   or 3 x 4   or 6 x 2   or 4 x 3   at first thrasymachus is\\nreluctant to argue   but at length   with a promise of payment on the\\npart of the company and of praise from socrates   he is induced to open\\nthe game     listen     he says     my answer is that might is right   justice\\nthe interest of the stronger   now praise me     let me understand you\\nfirst   do you mean that because polydamas the wrestler   who is stronger\\nthan we are   finds the eating of beef for his interest   the eating of\\nbeef is also for our interest   who are not so strong   thrasymachus is\\nindignant at the illustration   and in pompous words   apparently\\nintended to restore dignity to the argument   he explains his meaning to\\nbe that the rulers make laws for their own interests   but suppose   says\\nsocrates   that the ruler or stronger makes a mistake—then the interest\\nof the stronger is not his interest   thrasymachus is saved from this\\nspeedy downfall by his disciple cleitophon   who introduces the word\\n  thinks    —not the actual interest of the ruler   but what he thinks or\\nwhat seems to be his interest   is justice   the contradiction is escaped\\nby the unmeaning evasion   for though his real and apparent interests\\nmay differ   what the ruler thinks to be his interest will always remain\\nwhat he thinks to be his interest  \\n\\nof course this was not the original assertion   nor is the new\\ninterpretation accepted by thrasymachus himself   but socrates is not\\ndisposed to quarrel about words   if   as he significantly insinuates  \\nhis adversary has changed his mind   in what follows thrasymachus does\\nin fact withdraw his admission that the ruler may make a mistake   for\\nhe affirms that the ruler as a ruler is infallible   socrates is quite\\nready to accept the new position   which he equally turns against\\nthrasymachus by the help of the analogy of the arts   every art or\\nscience has an interest   but this interest is to be distinguished from\\nthe accidental interest of the artist   and is only concerned with the\\ngood of the things or persons which come under the art   and justice has\\nan interest which is the interest not of the ruler or judge   but of\\nthose who come under his sway  \\n\\nthrasymachus is on the brink of the inevitable conclusion   when he\\nmakes a bold diversion     tell me   socrates     he says     have you a\\nnurse     what a question   why do you ask     because   if you have   she\\nneglects you and lets you go about drivelling   and has not even taught\\nyou to know the shepherd from the sheep   for you fancy that shepherds\\nand rulers never think of their own interest   but only of their sheep\\nor subjects   whereas the truth is that they fatten them for their use  \\nsheep and subjects alike   and experience proves that in every relation\\nof life the just man is the loser and the unjust the gainer   especially\\nwhere injustice is on the grand scale   which is quite another thing\\nfrom the petty rogueries of swindlers and burglars and robbers of\\ntemples   the language of men proves this—our   gracious   and   blessed  \\ntyrant and the like—all which tends to show   1   that justice is the\\ninterest of the stronger   and   2   that injustice is more profitable and\\nalso stronger than justice    \\n\\nthrasymachus   who is better at a speech than at a close argument  \\nhaving deluged the company with words   has a mind to escape   but the\\nothers will not let him go   and socrates adds a humble but earnest\\nrequest that he will not desert them at such a crisis of their fate  \\n  and what can i do more for you     he says     would you have me put the\\nwords bodily into your souls     god forbid   replies socrates   but we\\nwant you to be consistent in the use of terms   and not to employ\\n  physician   in an exact sense   and then again   shepherd   or   ruler   in\\nan inexact  —if the words are strictly taken   the ruler and the shepherd\\nlook only to the good of their people or flocks and not to their own  \\nwhereas you insist that rulers are solely actuated by love of office  \\n  no doubt about it     replies thrasymachus   then why are they paid   is\\nnot the reason   that their interest is not comprehended in their art  \\nand is therefore the concern of another art   the art of pay   which is\\ncommon to the arts in general   and therefore not identical with any one\\nof them   nor would any man be a ruler unless he were induced by the\\nhope of reward or the fear of punishment  —the reward is money or\\nhonour   the punishment is the necessity of being ruled by a man worse\\nthan himself   and if a state   or church   were composed entirely of good\\nmen   they would be affected by the last motive only   and there would be\\nas much   nolo episcopari   as there is at present of the opposite      \\n\\nthe satire on existing governments is heightened by the simple and\\napparently incidental manner in which the last remark is introduced  \\nthere is a similar irony in the argument that the governors of mankind\\ndo not like being in office   and that therefore they demand pay  \\n\\n      enough of this   the other assertion of thrasymachus is far more\\nimportant—that the unjust life is more gainful than the just   now   as\\nyou and i   glaucon   are not convinced by him   we must reply to him   but\\nif we try to compare their respective gains we shall want a judge to\\ndecide for us   we had better therefore proceed by making mutual\\nadmissions of the truth to one another  \\n\\nthrasymachus had asserted that perfect injustice was more gainful than\\nperfect justice   and after a little hesitation he is induced by\\nsocrates to admit the still greater paradox that injustice is virtue\\nand justice vice   socrates praises his frankness   and assumes the\\nattitude of one whose only wish is to understand the meaning of his\\nopponents   at the same time he is weaving a net in which thrasymachus\\nis finally enclosed   the admission is elicited from him that the just\\nman seeks to gain an advantage over the unjust only   but not over the\\njust   while the unjust would gain an advantage over either   socrates  \\nin order to test this statement   employs once more the favourite\\nanalogy of the arts   the musician   doctor   skilled artist of any sort  \\ndoes not seek to gain more than the skilled   but only more than the\\nunskilled   that is to say   he works up to a rule   standard   law   and\\ndoes not exceed it     whereas the unskilled makes random efforts at\\nexcess   thus the skilled falls on the side of the good   and the\\nunskilled on the side of the evil   and the just is the skilled   and the\\nunjust is the unskilled  \\n\\nthere was great difficulty in bringing thrasymachus to the point   the\\nday was hot and he was streaming with perspiration   and for the first\\ntime in his life he was seen to blush   but his other thesis that\\ninjustice was stronger than justice has not yet been refuted   and\\nsocrates now proceeds to the consideration of this   which   with the\\nassistance of thrasymachus   he hopes to clear up   the latter is at\\nfirst churlish   but in the judicious hands of socrates is soon restored\\nto good  humour   is there not honour among thieves   is not the strength\\nof injustice only a remnant of justice   is not absolute injustice\\nabsolute weakness also   a house that is divided against itself cannot\\nstand   two men who quarrel detract from one another  s strength   and he\\nwho is at war with himself is the enemy of himself and the gods   not\\nwickedness therefore   but semi  wickedness flourishes in states  —a\\nremnant of good is needed in order to make union in action\\npossible  —there is no kingdom of evil in this world  \\n\\nanother question has not been answered   is the just or the unjust the\\nhappier   to this we reply   that every art has an end and an excellence\\nor virtue by which the end is accomplished   and is not the end of the\\nsoul happiness   and justice the excellence of the soul by which\\nhappiness is attained   justice and happiness being thus shown to be\\ninseparable   the question whether the just or the unjust is the happier\\nhas disappeared  \\n\\nthrasymachus replies     let this be your entertainment   socrates   at the\\nfestival of bendis     yes   and a very good entertainment with which your\\nkindness has supplied me   now that you have left off scolding   and yet\\nnot a good entertainment—but that was my own fault   for i tasted of too\\nmany things   first of all the nature of justice was the subject of our\\nenquiry   and then whether justice is virtue and wisdom   or evil and\\nfolly   and then the comparative advantages of just and unjust   and the\\nsum of all is that i know not what justice is   how then shall i know\\nwhether the just is happy or not        \\n\\nthus the sophistical fabric has been demolished   chiefly by appealing\\nto the analogy of the arts     justice is like the arts   1   in having no\\nexternal interest   and   2   in not aiming at excess   and   3   justice is\\nto happiness what the implement of the workman is to his work     at this\\nthe modern reader is apt to stumble   because he forgets that plato is\\nwriting in an age when the arts and the virtues   like the moral and\\nintellectual faculties   were still undistinguished   among early\\nenquirers into the nature of human action the arts helped to fill up\\nthe void of speculation   and at first the comparison of the arts and\\nthe virtues was not perceived by them to be fallacious   they only saw\\nthe points of agreement in them and not the points of difference  \\nvirtue   like art   must take means to an end   good manners are both an\\nart and a virtue   character is naturally described under the image of a\\nstatue   and there are many other figures of speech which are readily\\ntransferred from art to morals   the next generation cleared up these\\nperplexities   or at least supplied after ages with a further analysis\\nof them   the contemporaries of plato were in a state of transition   and\\nhad not yet fully realized the common  sense distinction of aristotle  \\nthat   virtue is concerned with action   art with production     nic  \\neth       or that   virtue implies intention and constancy of purpose    \\nwhereas   art requires knowledge only     and yet in the absurdities which\\nfollow from some uses of the analogy   there seems to be an intimation\\nconveyed that virtue is more than art   this is implied in the reductio\\nad absurdum that   justice is a thief     and in the dissatisfaction which\\nsocrates expresses at the final result  \\n\\nthe expression   an art of pay   which is described as   common to all the\\narts   is not in accordance with the ordinary use of language   nor is it\\nemployed elsewhere either by plato or by any other greek writer   it is\\nsuggested by the argument   and seems to extend the conception of art to\\ndoing as well as making   another flaw or inaccuracy of language may be\\nnoted in the words   men who are injured are made more unjust     for\\nthose who are injured are not necessarily made worse   but only harmed\\nor illtreated  \\nthe second of the three arguments that the just does not aim at excess   has a real meaning   though wrapped up in an enigmatical form  \\nthat the good is of the nature of the finite is a peculiarly hellenic\\nsentiment   which may be compared with the language of those modern\\nwriters who speak of virtue as fitness   and of freedom as obedience to\\nlaw   the mathematical or logical notion of limit easily passes into an\\nethical one   and even finds a mythological expression in the conception\\nof envy   greek     ideas of measure   equality   order   unity   proportion  \\nstill linger in the writings of moralists   and the true spirit of the\\nfine arts is better conveyed by such terms than by

called the epilogue of the discussion with thrasymachus  \\nplato argues that evil is not a principle of strength   but of discord\\nand dissolution   just touching the question which has been often\\ntreated in modern times by theologians and philosophers   of the\\nnegative nature of evil   in the last argument we trace the germ of the\\naristotelian doctrine of an end and a virtue directed towards the end  \\nwhich again is suggested by the arts   the final reconcilement of\\njustice and happiness and the identity of the individual and the state\\nare also intimated   socrates reassumes the character of a\\n  know  nothing     at the same time he appears to be not wholly satisfied\\nwith the manner in which the argument has been conducted   nothing is\\nconcluded   but the tendency of the dialectical process   here as always  \\nis to enlarge our conception of ideas   and to widen their application\\nto human life  \\n\\nbook ii   thrasymachus is pacified   but the intrepid glaucon insists on\\ncontinuing the argument   he is not satisfied with the indirect manner\\nin which   at the end of the last book   socrates had disposed of the\\nquestion   whether the just or the unjust is the happier     he begins by\\ndividing goods into three classes  —first   goods desirable in\\nthemselves   secondly   goods desirable in themselves and for their\\nresults   thirdly   goods desirable for their results only   he then asks\\nsocrates in which of the three classes he would place justice   in the\\nsecond class   replies socrates   among goods desirable for themselves\\nand also for their results     then the world in general are of another\\nmind   for they say that justice belongs to the troublesome class of\\ngoods which are desirable for their results only   socrates answers that\\nthis is the doctrine of thrasymachus which he rejects   glaucon thinks\\nthat thrasymachus was too ready to listen to the voice of the charmer  \\nand proposes to consider the nature of justice and injustice in\\nthemselves and apart from the results and rewards of them which the\\nworld is always dinning in his ears   he will first of all speak of the\\nnature and origin of justice   secondly   of the manner in which men view\\njustice as a necessity and not a good   and thirdly   he will prove the\\nreasonableness of this view  \\n\\n  to do injustice is said to be a good   to suffer injustice an evil   as\\nthe evil is discovered by experience to be greater than the good   the\\nsufferers   who cannot also be doers   make a compact that they will have\\nneither   and this compact or mean is called justice   but is really the\\nimpossibility of doing injustice   no one would observe such a compact\\nif he were not obliged   let us suppose that the just and unjust have\\ntwo rings   like that of gyges in the well  known story   which make them\\ninvisible   and then no difference will appear in them   for every one\\nwill do evil if he can   and he who abstains will be regarded by the\\nworld as a fool for his pains   men may praise him in public out of fear\\nfor themselves   but they will laugh at him in their hearts   cp  \\ngorgias    \\n\\n  and now let us frame an ideal of the just and unjust   imagine the\\nunjust man to be master of his craft   seldom making mistakes and easily\\ncorrecting them   having gifts of money   speech   strength—the greatest\\nvillain bearing the highest character   and at his side let us place the\\njust in his nobleness and simplicity—being   not seeming—without name or\\nreward—clothed in his justice only—the best of men who is thought to be\\nthe worst   and let him die as he has lived   i might add   but i would\\nrather put the rest into the mouth of the panegyrists of injustice—they\\nwill tell you   that the just man will be scourged   racked   bound   will\\nhave his eyes put out   and will at last be crucified   literally\\nimpaled  —and all this because he ought to have preferred seeming to\\nbeing   how different is the case of the unjust who clings to appearance\\nas the true reality   his high character makes him a ruler   he can marry\\nwhere he likes   trade where he likes   help his friends and hurt his\\nenemies   having got rich by dishonesty he can worship the gods better  \\nand will therefore be more loved by them than the just    \\n\\ni was thinking what to answer   when adeimantus joined in the already\\nunequal fray   he considered that the most important point of all had\\nbeen omitted  —  men are taught to be just for the sake of rewards  \\nparents and guardians make reputation the incentive to virtue   and\\nother advantages are promised by them of a more solid kind   such as\\nwealthy marriages and high offices   there are the pictures in homer and\\nhesiod of fat sheep and heavy fleeces   rich corn  fields and trees\\ntoppling with fruit   which the gods provide in this life for the just  \\nand the orphic poets add a similar picture of another   the heroes of\\nmusaeus and eumolpus lie on couches at a festival   with garlands on\\ntheir heads   enjoying as the meed of virtue a paradise of immortal\\ndrunkenness   some go further   and speak of a fair posterity in the\\nthird and fourth generation   but the wicked they bury in a slough and\\nmake them carry water in a sieve   and in this life they attribute to\\nthem the infamy which glaucon was assuming to be the lot of the just\\nwho are supposed to be unjust  \\n\\n  take another kind of argument which is found both in poetry and\\nprose  —  virtue     as hesiod says     is honourable but difficult   vice is\\neasy and profitable     you may often see the wicked in great prosperity\\nand the righteous afflicted by the will of heaven   and mendicant\\nprophets knock at rich men  s doors   promising to atone for the sins of\\nthemselves or their fathers in an easy fashion with sacrifices and\\nfestive games   or with charms and invocations to get rid of an enemy\\ngood or bad by divine help and at a small charge  —they appeal to books\\nprofessing to be written by musaeus and orpheus   and carry away the\\nminds of whole cities   and promise to   get souls out of purgatory     and\\nif we refuse to listen to them   no one knows what will happen to us  \\n\\n  when a lively  minded ingenuous youth hears all this   what will be his\\nconclusion     will he     in the language of pindar     make justice his\\nhigh tower   or fortify himself with crooked deceit     justice   he\\nreflects   without the appearance of justice   is misery and ruin  \\ninjustice has the promise of a glorious life   appearance is master of\\ntruth and lord of happiness   to appearance then i will turn  —i will put\\non the show of virtue and trail behind me the fox of archilochus   i\\nhear some one saying that   wickedness is not easily concealed     to\\nwhich i reply that   nothing great is easy     union and force and\\nrhetoric will do much   and if men say that they cannot prevail over the\\ngods   still how do we know that there are gods   only from the poets  \\nwho acknowledge that they may be appeased by sacrifices   then why not\\nsin and pay for indulgences out of your sin   for if the righteous are\\nonly unpunished   still they have no further reward   while the wicked\\nmay be unpunished and have the pleasure of sinning too   but what of the\\nworld below   nay   says the argument   there are atoning powers who will\\nset that matter right   as the poets   who are the sons of the gods   tell\\nus   and this is confirmed by the authority of the state  \\n\\n  how can we resist such arguments in favour of injustice   add good\\nmanners   and   as the wise tell us   we shall make the best of both\\nworlds   who that is not a miserable caitiff will refrain from smiling\\nat the praises of justice   even if a man knows the better part he will\\nnot be angry with others   for he knows also that more than human virtue\\nis needed to save a man   and that he only praises justice who is\\nincapable of injustice  \\n\\n  the origin of the evil is that all men from the beginning   heroes  \\npoets   instructors of youth   have always asserted   the temporal\\ndispensation     the honours and profits of justice   had we been taught\\nin early youth the power of justice and injustice inherent in the soul  \\nand unseen by any human or divine eye   we should not have needed others\\nto be our guardians   but every one would have been the guardian of\\nhimself   this is what i want you to show   socrates  —other men use\\narguments which rather tend to strengthen the position of thrasymachus\\nthat   might is right     but from you i expect better things   and please  \\nas glaucon said   to exclude reputation   let the just be thought unjust\\nand the unjust just   and do you still prove to us the superiority of\\njustice        \\n\\nthe thesis   which for the sake of argument has been maintained by\\nglaucon   is the converse of that of thrasymachus—not right is the\\ninterest of the stronger   but right is the necessity of the weaker  \\nstarting from the same premises he carries the analysis of society a\\nstep further back  —might is still right   but the might is the weakness\\nof the many combined against the strength of the few  \\n\\nthere have been theories in modern as well as in ancient times which\\nhave a family likeness to the speculations of glaucon   e  g   that power\\nis the foundation of right   or that a monarch has a divine right to\\ngovern well or ill   or that virtue is self  love or the love of power  \\nor that war is the natural state of man   or that private vices are\\npublic benefits   all such theories have a kind of plausibility from\\ntheir partial agreement with experience   for human nature oscillates\\nbetween good and evil   and the motives of actions and the origin of\\ninstitutions may be explained to a certain extent on either hypothesis\\naccording to the character or point of view of a particular thinker  \\nthe obligation of maintaining authority under all circumstances and\\nsometimes by rather questionable means is felt strongly and has become\\na sort of instinct among civilized men   the divine right of kings   or\\nmore generally of governments   is one of the forms under which this\\nnatural feeling is expressed   nor again is there any evil which has not\\nsome accompaniment of good or pleasure   nor any good which is free from\\nsome alloy of evil   nor any noble or generous thought which may not be\\nattended by a shadow or the ghost of a shadow of self  interest or of\\nself  love   we know that all human actions are imperfect   but we do not\\ntherefore attribute them to the worse rather than to the better motive\\nor principle   such a philosophy is both foolish and false   like that\\nopinion of the clever rogue who assumes all other men to be like\\nhimself   and theories of this sort do not represent the real nature of\\nthe state   which is based on a vague sense of right gradually corrected\\nand enlarged by custom and law   although capable also of perversion    \\nany more than they describe the origin of society   which is to be\\nsought in the family and in the social and religious feelings of man  \\nnor do they represent the average character of individuals   which\\ncannot be explained simply on a theory of evil   but has always a\\ncounteracting element of good   and as men become better such theories\\nappear more and more untruthful to them   because they are more\\nconscious of their own disinterestedness   a little experience may make\\na man a cynic   a great deal will bring him back to a truer and kindlier\\nview of the mixed nature of himself and his fellow men  \\n\\nthe two brothers ask socrates to prove to them that the just is happy\\nwhen they have taken from him all that in which happiness is ordinarily\\nsupposed to consist   not that there is   1   any absurdity in the attempt\\nto frame a notion of justice apart from circumstances   for the ideal\\nmust always be a paradox when compared with the ordinary conditions of\\nhuman life   neither the stoical ideal nor the christian ideal is true\\nas a fact   but they may serve as a basis of education   and may exercise\\nan ennobling influence   an ideal is none the worse because   some one\\nhas made the discovery   that no such ideal was ever realized   and in a\\nfew exceptional individuals who are raised above the ordinary level of\\nhumanity   the ideal of happiness may be realized in death and misery  \\nthis may be the state which the reason deliberately approves   and which\\nthe utilitarian as well as every other moralist may be bound in certain\\ncases to prefer  \\n\\nnor again     2   must we forget that plato   though he agrees generally\\nwith the view implied in the argument of the two brothers   is not\\nexpressing his own final conclusion   but rather seeking to dramatize\\none of the aspects of ethical truth   he is developing his idea\\ngradually in a series of positions or situations   he is exhibiting\\nsocrates for the first time undergoing the socratic interrogation  \\nlastly     3   the word   happiness   involves some degree of confusion\\nbecause associated in the language of modern philosophy with conscious\\npleasure or satisfaction   which was not equally present to his mind  \\n\\nglaucon has been drawing a picture of the misery of the just and the\\nhappiness of the unjust   to which the misery of the tyrant in book ix\\nis the answer and parallel   and still the unjust must appear just   that\\nis   the homage which vice pays to virtue     but now adeimantus   taking\\nup the hint which had been already given by glaucon   proceeds to show\\nthat in the opinion of mankind justice is regarded only for the sake of\\nrewards and reputation   and points out the advantage which is given to\\nsuch arguments as those of thrasymachus and glaucon by the conventional\\nmorality of mankind   he seems to feel the difficulty of   justifying the\\nways of god to man     both the brothers touch upon the question   whether\\nthe morality of actions is determined by their consequences   and both\\nof them go beyond the position of socrates   that justice belongs to the\\nclass of goods not desirable for themselves only   but desirable for\\nthemselves and for their results   to which he recalls them   in their\\nattempt to view justice as an internal principle   and in their\\ncondemnation of the poets   they anticipate him   the common life of\\ngreece is not enough for them   they must penetrate deeper into the\\nnature of things  \\n\\nit has been objected that justice is honesty in the sense of glaucon\\nand adeimantus   but is taken by socrates to mean all virtue   may we not\\nmore truly say that the old  fashioned notion of justice is enlarged by\\nsocrates   and becomes equivalent to universal order or well  being  \\nfirst in the state   and secondly in the individual   he has found a new\\nanswer to his old question   protag         whether the virtues are one or\\nmany     viz   that one is the ordering principle of the three others   in\\nseeking to establish the purely internal nature of justice   he is met\\nby the fact that man is a social being   and he tries to harmonise the\\ntwo opposite theses as well as he can   there is no more inconsistency\\nin this than was inevitable in his age and country   there is no use in\\nturning upon him the cross lights of modern philosophy   which   from\\nsome other point of view   would appear equally inconsistent   plato does\\nnot give the final solution of philosophical questions for us   nor can\\nhe be judged of by our standard  \\n\\nthe remainder of the republic is developed out of the question of the\\nsons of ariston   three points are deserving of remark in what\\nimmediately follows  —first   that the answer of socrates is altogether\\nindirect   he does not say that happiness consists in the contemplation\\nof the idea of justice   and still less will he be tempted to affirm the\\nstoical paradox that the just man can be happy on the rack   but first\\nhe dwells on the difficulty of the problem and insists on restoring man\\nto his natural condition   before he will answer the question at all   he\\ntoo will frame an ideal   but his ideal comprehends not only abstract\\njustice   but the whole relations of man   under the fanciful\\nillustration of the large letters he implies that he will only look for\\njustice in society   and that from the state he will proceed to the\\nindividual   his answer in substance amounts to this  —that under\\nfavourable conditions   i  e   in the perfect state   justice and happiness\\nwill coincide   and that when justice has been once found   happiness may\\nbe left to take care of itself   that he falls into some degree of\\ninconsistency   when in the tenth book he claims to have got rid of the\\nrewards and honours of justice   may be admitted   for he has left those\\nwhich exist in the perfect state   and the philosopher   who retires\\nunder the shelter of a wall   can hardly have been esteemed happy by\\nhim   at least not in this world   still he maintains the true attitude\\nof moral action   let a man do his duty first   without asking whether he\\nwill be happy or not   and happiness will be the inseparable accident\\nwhich attends him     seek ye first the kingdom of god and his\\nrighteousness   and all these things shall be added unto you    \\n\\nsecondly   it may be remarked that plato preserves the genuine character\\nof greek thought in beginning with the state and in going on to the\\nindividual   first ethics   then politics—this is the order of ideas to\\nus   the reverse is the order of history   only after many struggles of\\nthought does the individual assert his right as a moral being   in early\\nages he is not one   but one of many   the citizen of a state which is\\nprior to him   and he has no notion of good or evil apart from the law\\nof his country or the creed of his church   and to this type he is\\nconstantly tending to revert   whenever the influence of custom   or of\\nparty spirit   or the recollection of the past becomes too strong for\\nhim  \\n\\nthirdly   we may observe the confusion or identification of the\\nindividual and the state   of ethics and politics   which pervades early\\ngreek speculation   and even in modern times retains a certain degree of\\ninfluence   the subtle difference between the collective and individual\\naction of mankind seems to have escaped early thinkers   and we too are\\nsometimes in danger of forgetting the conditions of united human\\naction   whenever we either elevate politics into ethics   or lower\\nethics to the standard of politics   the good man and the good citizen\\nonly coincide in the perfect state   and this perfection cannot be\\nattained by legislation acting upon them from without   but   if at all  \\nby education fashioning them from within  \\n\\n      socrates praises the sons of ariston     inspired offspring of the\\nrenowned hero     as the elegiac poet terms them   but he does not\\nunderstand how they can argue so eloquently on behalf of injustice\\nwhile their character shows that they are uninfluenced by their own\\narguments   he knows not how to answer them   although he is afraid of\\ndeserting justice in the hour of need   he therefore makes a condition  \\nthat having weak eyes he shall be allowed to read the large letters\\nfirst and then go on to the smaller   that is   he must look for justice\\nin the state first   and will then proceed to the individual  \\naccordingly he begins to construct the state  \\n\\nsociety arises out of the wants of man   his first want is food   his\\nsecond a house   his third a coat   the sense of these needs and the\\npossibility of satisfying them by exchange   draw individuals together\\non the same spot   and this is the beginning of a state   which we take\\nthe liberty to invent   although necessity is the real inventor   there\\nmust be first a husbandman   secondly a builder   thirdly a weaver   to\\nwhich may be added a cobbler   four or five citizens at least are\\nrequired to make a city   now men have different natures   and one man\\nwill do one thing better than many   and business waits for no man  \\nhence there must be a division of labour into different employments  \\ninto wholesale and retail trade   into workers   and makers of workmen  s\\ntools   into shepherds and husbandmen   a city which includes all this\\nwill have far exceeded the limit of four or five   and yet not be very\\nlarge   but then again imports will be required   and imports necessitate\\nexports   and this implies variety of produce in order to attract the\\ntaste of purchasers   also merchants and ships   in the city too we must\\nhave a market and money and retail trades   otherwise buyers and sellers\\nwill never meet   and the valuable time of the producers will be wasted\\nin vain efforts at exchange   if we add hired servants the state will be\\ncomplete   and we may guess that somewhere in the intercourse of the\\ncitizens with one another justice and injustice will appear  \\n\\nhere follows a rustic picture of their way of life   they spend their\\ndays in houses which they have built for themselves   they make their\\nown clothes and produce their own corn and wine   their principal food\\nis meal and flour   and they drink in moderation   they live on the best\\nof terms with each other   and take care not to have too many children  \\n  but     said glaucon   interposing     are they not to have a relish    \\ncertainly   they will have salt and olives and cheese   vegetables and\\nfruits   and chestnuts to roast at the fire       tis a city of pigs  \\nsocrates     why   i replied   what do you want more     only the comforts of\\nlife  —sofas and tables   also sauces and sweets     i see   you want not\\nonly a state   but a luxurious state   and possibly in the more complex\\nframe we may sooner find justice and injustice   then the fine arts must\\ngo to work—every conceivable instrument and ornament of luxury will be\\nwanted   there will be dancers   painters   sculptors   musicians   cooks  \\nbarbers   tire  women   nurses   artists   swineherds and neatherds too for\\nthe animals   and physicians to cure the disorders of which luxury is\\nthe source   to feed all these superfluous mouths we shall need a part\\nof our neighbour  s land   and they will want a part of ours   and this is\\nthe origin of war   which may be traced to the same causes as other\\npolitical evils   our city will now require the slight addition of a\\ncamp   and the citizen will be converted into a soldier   but then again\\nour old doctrine of the division of labour must not be forgotten   the\\nart of war cannot be learned in a day   and there must be a natural\\naptitude for military duties   there will be some warlike natures who\\nhave this aptitude—dogs keen of scent   swift of foot to pursue   and\\nstrong of limb to fight   and as spirit is the foundation of courage  \\nsuch natures   whether of men or animals   will be full of spirit   but\\nthese spirited natures are apt to bite and devour one another   the\\nunion of gentleness to friends and fierceness against enemies appears\\nto be an impossibility   and the guardian of a state requires both\\nqualities   who then can be a guardian   the image of the dog suggests an\\nanswer   for dogs are gentle to friends and fierce to strangers   your\\ndog is a philosopher who judges by the rule of knowing or not knowing  \\nand philosophy   whether in man or beast   is the parent of gentleness  \\nthe human watchdogs must be philosophers or lovers of learning which\\nwill make them gentle   and how are they to be learned without\\neducation  \\n\\nbut what shall their education be   is any better than the old  fashioned\\nsort which is comprehended under the name of music and gymnastic   music\\nincludes literature   and literature is of two kinds   true and false  \\n  what do you mean     he said   i mean that children hear stories before\\nthey learn gymnastics   and that the stories are either untrue   or have\\nat most one or two grains of truth in a bushel of falsehood   now early\\nlife is very impressible   and children ought not to learn what they\\nwill have to unlearn when they grow up   we must therefore have a\\ncensorship of nursery tales   banishing some and keeping others   some of\\nthem are very improper   as we may see in the great instances of homer\\nand hesiod   who not only tell lies but bad lies   stories about uranus\\nand saturn   which are immoral as well as false   and which should never\\nbe spoken of to young persons   or indeed at all   or   if at all   then in\\na mystery   after the sacrifice   not of an eleusinian pig   but of some\\nunprocurable animal   shall our youth be encouraged to beat their\\nfathers by the example of zeus   or our citizens be incited to quarrel\\nby hearing or seeing representations of strife among the gods   shall\\nthey listen to the narrative of hephaestus binding his mother   and of\\nzeus sending him flying for helping her when she was beaten   such tales\\nmay possibly have a mystical interpretation   but the young are\\nincapable of understanding allegory   if any one asks what tales are to\\nbe allowed   we will answer that we are legislators and not book  makers  \\nwe only lay down the principles according to which books are to be\\nwritten   to write them is the duty of others  \\n\\nand our first principle is   that god must be represented as he is   not\\nas the author of all things   but of good only   we will not suffer the\\npoets to say that he is the steward of good and evil   or that he has\\ntwo casks full of destinies  —or that athene and zeus incited pandarus\\nto break the treaty   or that god caused the sufferings of niobe   or of\\npelops   or the trojan war   or that he makes men sin when he wishes to\\ndestroy them   either these were not the actions of the gods   or god was\\njust   and men were the better for being punished   but that the deed was\\nevil   and god the author   is a wicked   suicidal fiction which we will\\nallow no one   old or young   to utter   this is our first and great\\nprinciple—god is the author of good only  \\n\\nand the second principle is like unto it  —with god is no variableness\\nor change of form   reason teaches us this   for if we suppose a change\\nin god   he must be changed either by another or by himself   by\\nanother  —but the best works of nature and art and the noblest qualities\\nof mind are least liable to be changed by any external force   by\\nhimself  —but he cannot change for the better   he will hardly change for\\nthe worse   he remains for ever fairest and best in his own image  \\ntherefore we refuse to listen to the poets who tell us of here begging\\nin the likeness of a priestess or of other deities who prowl about at\\nnight in strange disguises   all that blasphemous nonsense with which\\nmothers fool the manhood out of their children must be suppressed   but\\nsome one will say that god   who is himself unchangeable   may take a\\nform in relation to us   why should he   for gods as well as men hate the\\nlie in the soul   or principle of falsehood   and as for any other form\\nof lying which is used for a purpose and is regarded as innocent in\\ncertain exceptional cases—what need have the gods of this   for they are\\nnot ignorant of antiquity like the poets   nor are they afraid of their\\nenemies   nor is any madman a friend of theirs   god then is true   he is\\nabsolutely true   he changes not   he deceives not   by day or night   by\\nword or sign   this is our second great principle—god is true   away with\\nthe lying dream of agamemnon in homer   and the accusation of thetis\\nagainst apollo in aeschylus      \\n\\nin order to give clearness to his conception of the state   plato\\nproceeds to trace the first principles of mutual need and of division\\nof labour in an imaginary community of four or five citizens   gradually\\nthis community increases   the division of labour extends to countries  \\nimports necessitate exports   a medium of exchange is required   and\\nretailers sit in the market  place to save the time of the producers  \\nthese are the steps by which plato constructs the first or primitive\\nstate   introducing the elements of political economy by the way   as he\\nis going to frame a second or civilized state   the simple naturally\\ncomes before the complex   he indulges   like rousseau   in a picture of\\nprimitive life—an idea which has indeed often had a powerful influence\\non the imagination of mankind   but he does not seriously mean to say\\nthat one is better than the other   politicus     nor can any inference be\\ndrawn from the description of the first state taken apart from the\\nsecond   such as aristotle appears to draw in the politics   we should\\nnot interpret a platonic dialogue any more than a poem or a parable in\\ntoo literal or matter  of  fact a style   on the other hand   when we\\ncompare the lively fancy of plato with the dried  up abstractions of\\nmodern treatises on philosophy   we are compelled to say with\\nprotagoras   that the   mythus is more interesting     protag    \\n\\nseveral interesting remarks which in modern times would have a place in\\na treatise on political economy are scattered up and down the writings\\nof plato   especially laws   population   free trade   adulteration   wills\\nand bequests   begging   eryxias     though not plato  s     value and demand  \\nrepublic   division of labour   the last subject   and also the origin of\\nretail trade   is treated with admirable lucidity in the second book of\\nthe republic   but plato never combined his economic ideas into a\\nsystem   and never seems to have recognized that trade is one of the\\ngreat motive powers of the state and of the world   he would make retail\\ntraders only of the inferior sort of citizens   rep     laws     though he\\nremarks   quaintly enough   laws     that   if only the best men and the\\nbest women everywhere were compelled to keep taverns for a time or to\\ncarry on retail trade   etc     then we should knew how pleasant and\\nagreeable all these things are    \\n\\nthe disappointment of glaucon at the   city of pigs     the ludicrous\\ndescription of the ministers of luxury in the more refined state   and\\nthe afterthought of the necessity of doctors   the illustration of the\\nnature of the guardian taken from the dog   the desirableness of\\noffering some almost unprocurable victim when impure mysteries are to\\nbe celebrated   the behaviour of zeus to his father and of hephaestus to\\nhis mother   are touches of humour which have also a serious meaning   in\\nspeaking of education plato rather startles us by affirming that a\\nchild must be trained in falsehood first and in truth afterwards   yet\\nthis is not very different from saying that children must be taught\\nthrough the medium of imagination as well as reason   that their minds\\ncan only develope gradually   and that there is much which they must\\nlearn without understanding   this is also the substance of plato  s\\nview   though he must be acknowledged to have drawn the line somewhat\\ndifferently from modern ethical writers   respecting truth and\\nfalsehood   to us   economies or accommodations would not be allowable\\nunless they were required by the human faculties or necessary for the\\ncommunication of knowledge to the simple and ignorant   we should insist\\nthat the word was inseparable from the intention   and that we must not\\nbe   falsely true     i  e   speak or act falsely in support of what was\\nright or true   but plato would limit the use of fictions only by\\nrequiring that they should have a good moral effect   and that such a\\ndangerous weapon as falsehood should be employed by the rulers alone\\nand for great objects  \\n\\na greek in the age of plato attached no importance to the question\\nwhether his religion was an historical fact   he was just beginning to\\nbe conscious that the past had a history   but he could see nothing\\nbeyond homer and hesiod   whether their narratives were true or false\\ndid not seriously affect the political or social life of hellas   men\\nonly began to suspect that they were fictions when they recognised them\\nto be immoral   and so in all religions   the consideration of their\\nmorality comes first   afterwards the truth of the documents in which\\nthey are recorded   or of the events natural or supernatural which are\\ntold of them   but in modern times   and in protestant countries perhaps\\nmore than in catholic   we have been too much inclined to identify the\\nhistorical with the moral   and some have refused to believe in religion\\nat all   unless a superhuman accuracy was discernible in every part of\\nthe record   the facts of an ancient or religious history are amongst\\nthe most important of all facts   but they are frequently uncertain   and\\nwe only learn the true lesson which is to be gathered from them when we\\nplace ourselves above them   these reflections tend to show that the\\ndifference between plato and ourselves   though not unimportant   is not\\nso great as might at first sight appear   for we should agree with him\\nin placing the moral before the historical truth of religion   and  \\ngenerally   in disregarding those errors or misstatements of fact which\\nnecessarily occur in the early stages of all religions   we know also\\nthat changes in the traditions of a country cannot be made in a day  \\nand are therefore tolerant of many things which science and criticism\\nwould condemn  \\n\\nwe note in passing that the allegorical interpretation of mythology  \\nsaid to have been first introduced as early as the sixth century before\\nchrist by theagenes of rhegium   was well established in the age of\\nplato   and here   as in the phaedrus   though for a different reason   was\\nrejected by him   that anachronisms whether of religion or law   when men\\nhave reached another stage of civilization   should be got rid of by\\nfictions is in accordance with universal experience   great is the art\\nof interpretation   and by a natural process   which when once discovered\\nwas always going on   what could not be altered was explained away   and\\nso without any palpable inconsistency there existed side by side two\\nforms of religion   the tradition inherited or invented by the poets and\\nthe customary worship of the temple   on the other hand   there was the\\nreligion of the philosopher   who was dwelling in the heaven of ideas  \\nbut did not therefore refuse to offer a cock to aesculapius   or to be\\nseen saying his prayers at the rising of the sun   at length the\\nantagonism between the popular and philosophical religion   never so\\ngreat among the greeks as in our own age   disappeared   and was only\\nfelt like the difference between the religion of the educated and\\nuneducated among ourselves   the zeus of homer and hesiod easily passed\\ninto the   royal mind   of plato   philebus     the giant heracles became\\nthe knight  errant and benefactor of mankind   these and still more\\nwonderful transformations were readily effected by the ingenuity of\\nstoics and neo  platonists in the two or three centuries before and\\nafter christ   the greek and roman religions were gradually permeated by\\nthe spirit of philosophy   having lost their ancient meaning   they were\\nresolved into poetry and morality   and probably were never purer than\\nat the time of their decay   when their influence over the world was\\nwaning  \\n\\na singular conception which occurs towards the end of the book is the\\nlie in the soul   this is connected with the platonic and socratic\\ndoctrine that involuntary ignorance is worse than voluntary   the lie in\\nthe soul is a true lie   the corruption of the highest truth   the\\ndeception of the highest part of the soul   from which he who is\\ndeceived has no power of delivering himself   for example   to represent\\ngod as false or immoral   or   according to plato   as deluding men with\\nappearances or as the author of evil   or again   to affirm with\\nprotagoras that   knowledge is sensation     or that   being is becoming    \\nor with thrasymachus   that might is right     would have been regarded by\\nplato as a lie of this hateful sort   the greatest unconsciousness of\\nthe greatest untruth   e  g   if   in the language of the gospels   john    \\n  he who was blind   were to say   i see     is another aspect of the state\\nof mind which plato is describing   the lie in the soul may be further\\ncompared with the sin against the holy ghost   luke     allowing for the\\ndifference between greek and christian modes of speaking   to this is\\nopposed the lie in words   which is only such a deception as may occur\\nin a play or poem   or allegory or figure of speech   or in any sort of\\naccommodation  —which though useless to the gods may be useful to men in\\ncertain cases   socrates is here answering the question which he had\\nhimself raised about the propriety of deceiving a madman   and he is\\nalso contrasting the nature of god and man   for god is truth   but\\nmankind can only be true by appearing sometimes to be partial   or\\nfalse   reserving for another place the greater questions of religion or\\neducation   we may note further     1   the approval of the old traditional\\neducation of greece     2   the preparation which plato is making for the\\nattack on homer and the poets     3   the preparation which he is also\\nmaking for the use of economies in the state     4   the contemptuous and\\nat the same time euphemistic manner in which here as below he alludes\\nto the   chronique scandaleuse   of the gods  \\n\\nbook iii   there is another motive in purifying religion   which is to\\nbanish fear   for no man can be courageous who is afraid of death   or\\nwho believes the tales which are repeated by the poets concerning the\\nworld below   they must be gently requested not to abuse hell   they may\\nbe reminded that their stories are both untrue and discouraging   nor\\nmust they be angry if we expunge obnoxious passages   such as the\\ndepressing words of achilles—  i would rather be a serving  man than rule\\nover all the dead     and the verses which tell of the squalid mansions  \\nthe senseless shadows   the flitting soul mourning over lost strength\\nand youth   the soul with a gibber going beneath the earth like smoke  \\nor the souls of the suitors which flutter about like bats   the terrors\\nand horrors of cocytus and styx   ghosts and sapless shades   and the\\nrest of their tartarean nomenclature   must vanish   such tales may have\\ntheir use   but they are not the proper food for soldiers   as little can\\nwe admit the sorrows and sympathies of the homeric heroes  —achilles  \\nthe son of thetis   in tears   throwing ashes on his head   or pacing up\\nand down the sea  shore in distraction   or priam   the cousin of the\\ngods   crying aloud   rolling in the mire   a good man is not prostrated\\nat the loss of children or fortune   neither is death terrible to him  \\nand therefore lamentations over the dead should not be practised by men\\nof note   they should be the concern of inferior persons only   whether\\nwomen or men   still worse is the attribution of such weakness to the\\ngods   as when the goddesses say     alas   my travail     and worst of all  \\nwhen the king of heaven himself laments his inability to save hector  \\nor sorrows over the impending doom of his dear sarpedon   such a\\ncharacter of god   if not ridiculed by our young men   is likely to be\\nimitated by them   nor should our citizens be given to excess of\\nlaughter—  such violent delights   are followed by a violent re  action  \\nthe description in the iliad of the gods shaking their sides at the\\nclumsiness of hephaestus will not be admitted by us     certainly not    \\n\\ntruth should have a high place among the virtues   for falsehood   as we\\nwere saying   is useless to the gods   and only useful to men as a\\nmedicine   but this employment of falsehood must remain a privilege of\\nstate   the common man must not in return tell a lie to the ruler   any\\nmore than the patient would tell a lie to his physician   or the sailor\\nto his captain  \\n\\nin the next place our youth must be temperate   and temperance consists\\nin self  control and obedience to authority   that is a lesson which\\nhomer teaches in some places     the achaeans marched on breathing\\nprowess   in silent awe of their leaders    —but a very different one in\\nother places     o heavy with wine   who hast the eyes of a dog   but the\\nheart of a stag     language of the latter kind will not impress\\nself  control on the minds of youth   the same may be said about his\\npraises of eating and drinking and his dread of starvation   also about\\nthe verses in which he tells of the rapturous loves of zeus and here  \\nor of how hephaestus once detained ares and aphrodite in a net on a\\nsimilar occasion   there is a nobler strain heard in the words  —  endure  \\nmy soul   thou hast endured worse     nor must we allow our citizens to\\nreceive bribes   or to say     gifts persuade the gods   gifts reverend\\nkings     or to applaud the ignoble advice of phoenix to achilles that he\\nshould get money out of the greeks before he assisted them   or the\\nmeanness of achilles himself in taking gifts from agamemnon   or his\\nrequiring a ransom for the body of hector   or his cursing of apollo   or\\nhis insolence to the river  god scamander   or his dedication to the dead\\npatroclus of his own hair which had been already dedicated to the other\\nriver  god spercheius   or his cruelty in dragging the body of hector\\nround the walls   and slaying the captives at the pyre   such a\\ncombination of meanness and cruelty in cheiron  s pupil is\\ninconceivable   the amatory exploits of peirithous and theseus are\\nequally unworthy   either these so  called sons of gods were not the sons\\nof gods   or they were not such as the poets imagine them   any more than\\nthe gods themselves are the authors of evil   the youth who believes\\nthat such things are done by those who have the blood of heaven flowing\\nin their veins will be too ready to imitate their example  \\n\\nenough of gods and heroes  —what shall we say about men   what the poets\\nand story  tellers say—that the wicked prosper and the righteous are\\nafflicted   or that justice is another  s gain   such misrepresentations\\ncannot be allowed by us   but in this we are anticipating the definition\\nof justice   and had therefore better defer the enquiry  \\n\\nthe subjects of poetry have been sufficiently treated   next follows\\nstyle   now all poetry is a narrative of events past   present   or to\\ncome   and narrative is of three kinds   the simple   the imitative   and a\\ncomposition of the two   an instance will make my meaning clear   the\\nfirst scene in homer is of the last or mixed kind   being partly\\ndescription and partly dialogue   but if you throw the dialogue into the\\n  oratio obliqua     the passage will run thus   the priest came and prayed\\napollo that the achaeans might take troy and have a safe return if\\nagamemnon would only give him back his daughter   and the other greeks\\nassented   but agamemnon was wroth   and so on—the whole then becomes\\ndescriptive   and the poet is the only speaker left   or   if you omit the\\nnarrative   the whole becomes dialogue   these are the three styles—which\\nof them is to be admitted into our state     do you ask whether tragedy\\nand comedy are to be admitted     yes   but also something more—is it not\\ndoubtful whether our guardians are to be imitators at all   or rather  \\nhas not the question been already answered   for we have decided that\\none man cannot in his life play many parts   any more than he can act\\nboth tragedy and comedy   or be rhapsodist and actor at once   human\\nnature is coined into very small pieces   and as our guardians have\\ntheir own business already   which is the care of freedom   they will\\nhave enough to do without imitating   if they imitate they should\\nimitate   not any meanness or baseness   but the good only   for the mask\\nwhich the actor wears is apt to become his face   we cannot allow men to\\nplay the parts of women   quarrelling   weeping   scolding   or boasting\\nagainst the gods  —least of all when making love or in labour   they must\\nnot represent slaves   or bullies   or cowards   drunkards   or madmen   or\\nblacksmiths   or neighing horses   or bellowing bulls   or sounding\\nrivers   or a raging sea   a good or wise man will be willing to perform\\ngood and wise actions   but he will be ashamed to play an inferior part\\nwhich he has never practised   and he will prefer to employ the\\ndescriptive style with as little imitation as possible   the man who has\\nno self  respect   on the contrary   will imitate anybody and anything  \\nsounds of nature and cries of animals alike   his whole performance will\\nbe imitation of gesture and voice   now in the descriptive style there\\nare few changes   but in the dramatic there are a great many   poets and\\nmusicians use either   or a compound of both   and this compound is very\\nattractive to youth and their teachers as well as to the vulgar   but\\nour state in which one man plays one part only is not adapted for\\ncomplexity   and when one of these polyphonous pantomimic gentlemen\\noffers to exhibit himself and his poetry we will show him every\\nobservance of respect   but at the same time tell him that there is no\\nroom for his kind in our state   we prefer the rough   honest poet   and\\nwill not depart from our original models   laws    \\n\\nnext as to the music   a song or ode has three parts  —the subject   the\\nharmony   and the rhythm   of which the two last are dependent upon the\\nfirst   as we banished strains of lamentation   so we may now banish the\\nmixed lydian harmonies   which are the harmonies of lamentation   and as\\nour citizens are to be temperate   we may also banish convivial\\nharmonies   such as the ionian and pure lydian   two remain—the dorian\\nand phrygian   the first for war   the second for peace   the one\\nexpressive of courage   the other of obedience or instruction or\\nreligious feeling   and as we reject varieties of harmony   we shall also\\nreject the many  stringed   variously  shaped instruments which give\\nutterance to them   and in particular the flute   which is more complex\\nthan any of them   the lyre and the harp may be permitted in the town  \\nand the pan  s  pipe in the fields   thus we have made a purgation of\\nmusic   and will now make a purgation of metres   these should be like\\nthe harmonies   simple and suitable to the occasion   there are four\\nnotes of the tetrachord   and there are three ratios of metre   3  2   2  2  \\n2  1   which have all their characteristics   and the feet have different\\ncharacteristics as well as the rhythms   but about this you and i must\\nask damon   the great musician   who speaks   if i remember rightly   of a\\nmartial measure as well as of dactylic   trochaic   and iambic rhythms  \\nwhich he arranges so as to equalize the syllables with one another  \\nassigning to each the proper quantity   we only venture to affirm the\\ngeneral principle that the style is to conform to the subject and the\\nmetre to the style   and that the simplicity and harmony of the soul\\nshould be reflected in them all   this principle of simplicity has to be\\nlearnt by every one in the days of his youth   and may be gathered\\nanywhere   from the creative and constructive arts   as well as from the\\nforms of plants and animals  \\n\\nother artists as well as poets should be warned against meanness or\\nunseemliness   sculpture and painting equally with music must conform to\\nthe law of simplicity   he who violates it cannot be allowed to work in\\nour city   and to corrupt the taste of our citizens   for our guardians\\nmust grow up   not amid images of deformity which will gradually poison\\nand corrupt their souls   but in a land of health and beauty where they\\nwill drink in from every object sweet and harmonious influences   and of\\nall these influences the greatest is the education given by music  \\nwhich finds a way into the innermost soul and imparts to it the sense\\nof beauty and of deformity   at first the effect is unconscious   but\\nwhen reason arrives   then he who has been thus trained welcomes her as\\nthe friend whom he always knew   as in learning to read   first we\\nacquire the elements or letters separately   and afterwards their\\ncombinations   and cannot recognize reflections of them until we know\\nthe letters themselves  —in like manner we must first attain the\\nelements or essential forms of the virtues   and then trace their\\ncombinations in life and experience   there is a music of the soul which\\nanswers to the harmony of the world   and the fairest object of a\\nmusical soul is the fair mind in the fair body   some defect in the\\nlatter may be excused   but not in the former   true love is the daughter\\nof temperance   and temperance is utterly opposed to the madness of\\nbodily pleasure   enough has been said of music   which makes a fair\\nending with love  \\n\\nnext we pass on to gymnastics   about which i would remark   that the\\nsoul is related to the body as a cause to an effect   and therefore if\\nwe educate the mind we may leave the education of the body in her\\ncharge   and need only give a general outline of the course to be\\npursued   in the first place the guardians must abstain from strong\\ndrink   for they should be the last persons to lose their wits   whether\\nthe habits of the palaestra are suitable to them is more doubtful   for\\nthe ordinary gymnastic is a sleepy sort of thing   and if left off\\nsuddenly is apt to endanger health   but our warrior athletes must be\\nwide  awake dogs   and must also be inured to all changes of food and\\nclimate   hence they will require a simpler kind of gymnastic   akin to\\ntheir simple music   and for their diet a rule may be found in homer  \\nwho feeds his heroes on roast meat only   and gives them no fish\\nalthough they are living at the sea  side   nor boiled meats which\\ninvolve an apparatus of pots and pans   and   if i am not mistaken   he\\nnowhere mentions sweet sauces   sicilian cookery and attic confections\\nand corinthian courtezans   which are to gymnastic what lydian and\\nionian melodies are to music   must be forbidden   where gluttony and\\nintemperance prevail the town quickly fills with doctors and pleaders  \\nand law and medicine give themselves airs as soon as the freemen of a\\nstate take an interest in them   but what can show a more disgraceful\\nstate of education than to have to go abroad for justice because you\\nhave none of your own at home   and yet there is a worse stage of the\\nsame disease—when men have learned to take a pleasure and pride in the\\ntwists and turns of the law   not considering how much better it would\\nbe for them so to order their lives as to have no need of a nodding\\njustice   and there is a like disgrace in employing a physician   not for\\nthe cure of wounds or epidemic disorders   but because a man has by\\nlaziness and luxury contracted diseases which were unknown in the days\\nof asclepius   how simple is the homeric practice of medicine   eurypylus\\nafter he has been wounded drinks a posset of pramnian wine   which is of\\na heating nature   and yet the sons of asclepius blame neither the\\ndamsel who gives him the drink   nor patroclus who is attending on him  \\nthe truth is that this modern system of nursing diseases was introduced\\nby herodicus the trainer   who   being of a sickly constitution   by a\\ncompound of training and medicine tortured first himself and then a\\ngood many other people   and lived a great deal longer than he had any\\nright   but asclepius would not practise this art   because he knew that\\nthe citizens of a well  ordered state have no leisure to be ill   and\\ntherefore he adopted the   kill or cure   method   which artisans and\\nlabourers employ     they must be at their business     they say     and have\\nno time for coddling   if they recover   well   if they don  t   there is an\\nend of them     whereas the rich man is supposed to be a gentleman who\\ncan afford to be ill   do you know a maxim of phocylides—that   when a\\nman begins to be rich     or   perhaps   a little sooner     he should\\npractise virtue     but how can excessive care of health be inconsistent\\nwith an ordinary occupation   and yet consistent with that practice of\\nvirtue which phocylides inculcates   when a student imagines that\\nphilosophy gives him a headache   he never does anything   he is always\\nunwell   this was the reason why asclepius and his sons practised no\\nsuch art   they were acting in the interest of the public   and did not\\nwish to preserve useless lives   or raise up a puny offspring to\\nwretched sires   honest diseases they honestly cured   and if a man was\\nwounded   they applied the proper remedies   and then let him eat and\\ndrink what he liked   but they declined to treat intemperate and\\nworthless subjects   even though they might have made large fortunes out\\nof them   as to the story of pindar   that asclepius was slain by a\\nthunderbolt for restoring a rich man to life   that is a lie—following\\nour old rule we must say either that he did not take bribes   or that he\\nwas not the son of a god  \\n\\nglaucon then asks socrates whether the best physicians and the best\\njudges will not be those who have had severally the greatest experience\\nof diseases and of crimes   socrates draws a distinction between the two\\nprofessions   the physician should have had experience of disease in his\\nown body   for he cures with his mind and not with his body   but the\\njudge controls mind by mind   and therefore his mind should not be\\ncorrupted by crime   where then is he to gain experience   how is he to\\nbe wise and also innocent   when young a good man is apt to be deceived\\nby evil  doers   because he has no pattern of evil in himself   and\\ntherefore the judge should be of a certain age   his youth should have\\nbeen innocent   and he should have acquired insight into evil not by the\\npractice of it   but by the observation of it in others   this is the\\nideal of a judge   the criminal turned detective is wonderfully\\nsuspicious   but when in company with good men who have experience   he\\nis at fault   for he foolishly imagines that every one is as bad as\\nhimself   vice may be known of virtue   but cannot know virtue   this is\\nthe sort of medicine and this the sort of law which will prevail in our\\nstate   they will be healing arts to better natures   but the evil body\\nwill be left to die by the one   and the evil soul will be put to death\\nby the other   and the need of either will be greatly diminished by good\\nmusic which will give harmony to the soul   and good gymnastic which\\nwill give health to the body   not that this division of music and\\ngymnastic really corresponds to soul and body   for they are both\\nequally concerned with the soul   which is tamed by the one and aroused\\nand sustained by the other   the two together supply our guardians with\\ntheir twofold nature   the passionate disposition when it has too much\\ngymnastic is hardened and brutalized   the gentle or philosophic temper\\nwhich has too much music becomes enervated   while a man is allowing\\nmusic to pour like water through the funnel of his ears   the edge of\\nhis soul gradually wears away   and the passionate or spirited element\\nis melted out of him   too little spirit is easily exhausted   too much\\nquickly passes into nervous irritability   so   again   the athlete by\\nfeeding and training has his courage doubled   but he soon grows stupid  \\nhe is like a wild beast   ready to do everything by blows and nothing by\\ncounsel or policy   there are two principles in man   reason and passion  \\nand to these   not to the soul and body   the two arts of music and\\ngymnastic correspond   he who mingles them in harmonious concord is the\\ntrue musician  —he shall be the presiding genius of our state  \\n\\nthe next question is   who are to be our rulers   first   the elder must\\nrule the younger   and the best of the elders will be the best\\nguardians   now they will be the best who love their subjects most   and\\nthink that they have a common interest with them in the welfare of the\\nstate   these we must select   but they must be watched at every epoch of\\nlife to see whether they have retained the same opinions and held out\\nagainst force and enchantment   for time and persuasion and the love of\\npleasure may enchant a man into a change of purpose   and the force of\\ngrief and pain may compel him   and therefore our guardians must be men\\nwho have been tried by many tests   like gold in the refiner  s fire   and\\nhave been passed first through danger   then through pleasure   and at\\nevery age have come out of such trials victorious and without stain   in\\nfull command of themselves and their principles   having all their\\nfaculties in harmonious exercise for their country  s good   these shall\\nreceive the highest honours both in life and death     it would perhaps\\nbe better to confine the term   guardians   to this select class   the\\nyounger men may be called   auxiliaries      \\n\\nand now for one magnificent lie   in the belief of which   oh that we\\ncould train our rulers  —at any rate let us make the attempt with the\\nrest of the world   what i am going to tell is only another version of\\nthe legend of cadmus   but our unbelieving generation will be slow to\\naccept such a story   the tale must be imparted   first to the rulers  \\nthen to the soldiers   lastly to the people   we will inform them that\\ntheir youth was a dream   and that during the time when they seemed to\\nbe undergoing their education they were really being fashioned in the\\nearth   who sent them up when they were ready   and that they must\\nprotect and cherish her whose children they are   and regard each other\\nas brothers and sisters     i do not wonder at your being ashamed to\\npropound such a fiction     there is more behind   these brothers and\\nsisters have different natures   and some of them god framed to rule  \\nwhom he fashioned of gold   others he made of silver   to be auxiliaries  \\nothers again to be husbandmen and craftsmen   and these were formed by\\nhim of brass and iron   but as they are all sprung from a common stock  \\na golden parent may have a silver son   or a silver parent a golden son  \\nand then there must be a change of rank   the son of the rich must\\ndescend   and the child of the artisan rise   in the social scale   for an\\noracle says   that the state will come to an end if governed by a man of\\nbrass or iron     will our citizens ever believe all this     not in the\\npresent generation   but in the next   perhaps   yes    \\n\\nnow let the earthborn men go forth under the command of their rulers  \\nand look about and pitch their camp in a high place   which will be safe\\nagainst enemies from without   and likewise against insurrections from\\nwithin   there let them sacrifice and set up their tents   for soldiers\\nthey are to be and not shopkeepers   the watchdogs and guardians of the\\nsheep   and luxury and avarice will turn them into wolves and tyrants  \\ntheir habits and their dwellings should correspond to their education  \\nthey should have no property   their pay should only meet their\\nexpenses   and they should have common meals   gold and silver we will\\ntell them that they have from god   and this divine gift in their souls\\nthey must not alloy with that earthly dross which passes under the name\\nof gold   they only of the citizens may not touch it   or be under the\\nsame roof with it   or drink from it   it is the accursed thing   should\\nthey ever acquire houses or lands or money of their own   they will\\nbecome householders and tradesmen instead of guardians   enemies and\\ntyrants instead of helpers   and the hour of ruin   both to themselves\\nand the rest of the state   will be at hand  \\n\\nthe religious and ethical aspect of plato  s education will hereafter be\\nconsidered under a separate head   some lesser points may be more\\nconveniently noticed in this place  \\n\\n1   the constant appeal to the authority of homer   whom   with grave\\nirony   plato   after the manner of his age   summons as a witness about\\nethics and psychology   as well as about diet and medicine   attempting\\nto distinguish the better lesson from the worse   sometimes altering the\\ntext from design   more than once quoting or alluding to homer\\ninaccurately   after the manner of the early logographers turning the\\niliad into prose   and delighting to draw far  fetched inferences from\\nhis words   or to make ludicrous applications of them   he does not   like\\nheracleitus   get into a rage with homer and archilochus   heracl       but\\nuses their words and expressions as vehicles of a higher truth   not on\\na system like theagenes of rhegium or metrodorus   or in later times the\\nstoics   but as fancy may dictate   and the conclusions drawn from them\\nare sound   although the premises are fictitious   these fanciful appeals\\nto homer add a charm to plato  s style   and at the same time they have\\nthe effect of a satire on the follies of homeric interpretation   to us\\n  and probably to himself     although they take the form of arguments  \\nthey are really figures of speech   they may be compared with modern\\ncitations from scripture   which have often a great rhetorical power\\neven when the original meaning of the words is entirely lost sight of  \\nthe real   like the platonic socrates   as we gather from the memorabilia\\nof xenophon   was fond of making similar adaptations   great in all ages\\nand countries   in religion as well as in law and literature   has been\\nthe art of interpretation  \\n\\n2     the style is to conform to the subject and the metre to the style    \\nnotwithstanding the fascination which the word   classical   exercises\\nover us   we can hardly maintain that this rule is observed in all the\\ngreek poetry which has come down to us   we cannot deny that the thought\\noften exceeds the power of lucid expression in aeschylus and pindar   or\\nthat rhetoric gets the better of the thought in the sophist  poet\\neuripides   only perhaps in sophocles is there a perfect harmony of the\\ntwo   in him alone do we find a grace of language like the beauty of a\\ngreek statue   in which there is nothing to add or to take away   at\\nleast this is true of single plays or of large portions of them   the\\nconnection in the tragic choruses and in the greek lyric poets is not\\nunfrequently a tangled thread which in an age before logic the poet was\\nunable to draw out   many thoughts and feelings mingled in his mind   and\\nhe had no power of disengaging or arranging them   for there is a subtle\\ninfluence of logic which requires to be transferred from prose to\\npoetry   just as the music and perfection of language are infused by\\npoetry into prose   in all ages the poet has been a bad judge of his own\\nmeaning   apol       for he does not see that the word which is full of\\nassociations to his own mind is difficult and unmeaning to that of\\nanother   or that the sequence which is clear to himself is puzzling to\\nothers   there are many passages in some of our greatest modern poets\\nwhich are far too obscure   in which there is no proportion between\\nstyle and subject   in which any half  expressed figure   any harsh\\nconstruction   any distorted collocation of words   any remote sequence\\nof ideas is admitted   and there is no voice   coming sweetly from\\nnature     or music adding the expression of feeling to thought   as if\\nthere could be poetry without beauty   or beauty without ease and\\nclearness   the obscurities of early greek poets arose necessarily out\\nof the state of language and logic which existed in their age   they are\\nnot examples to be followed by us   for the use of language ought in\\nevery generation to become clearer and clearer   like shakespere   they\\nwere great in spite   not in consequence   of their imperfections of\\nexpression   but there is no reason for returning to the necessary\\nobscurity which prevailed in the infancy of literature   the english\\npoets of the last century were certainly not obscure   and we have no\\nexcuse for losing what they had gained   or for going back to the\\nearlier or transitional age which preceded them   the thought of our own\\ntimes has not out  stripped language   a want of plato  s   art of\\nmeasuring   is the rule cause of the disproportion between them  \\n\\n3   in the third book of the republic a nearer approach is made to a\\ntheory of art than anywhere else in plato   his views may be summed up\\nas follows  —true art is not fanciful and imitative   but simple and\\nideal  —the expression of the highest moral energy   whether in action or\\nrepose   to live among works of plastic art which are of this noble and\\nsimple character   or to listen to such strains   is the best of\\ninfluences  —the true greek atmosphere   in which youth should be brought\\nup   that is the way to create in them a natural good taste   which will\\nhave a feeling of truth and beauty in all things   for though the poets\\nare to be expelled   still art is recognized as another aspect of\\nreason—like love in the symposium   extending over the same sphere   but\\nconfined to the preliminary education   and acting through the power of\\nhabit   and this conception of art is not limited to strains of music or\\nthe forms of plastic art   but pervades all nature and has a wide\\nkindred in the world   the republic of plato   like the athens of\\npericles   has an artistic as well as a political side  \\n\\nthere is hardly any mention in plato of the creative arts   only in two\\nor three passages does he even allude to them   rep     soph       he is not\\nlost in rapture at the great works of phidias   the parthenon   the\\npropylea   the statues of zeus or athene   he would probably have\\nregarded any abstract truth of number or figure as higher than the\\ngreatest of them   yet it is hard to suppose that some influence   such\\nas he hopes to inspire in youth   did not pass into his own mind from\\nthe works of art which he saw around him   we are living upon the\\nfragments of them   and find in a few broken stones the standard of\\ntruth and beauty   but in plato this feeling has no expression   he\\nnowhere says that beauty is the object of art   he seems to deny that\\nwisdom can take an external form   phaedrus     he does not distinguish\\nthe fine from the mechanical arts   whether or no   like some writers   he\\nfelt more than he expressed   it is at any rate remarkable that the\\ngreatest perfection of the fine arts should coincide with an almost\\nentire silence about them   in one very striking passage he tells us\\nthat a work of art   like the state   is a whole   and this conception of\\na whole and the love of the newly  born mathematical sciences may be\\nregarded   if not as the inspiring   at any rate as the regulating\\nprinciples of greek art   xen   mem     and sophist    \\n\\n4   plato makes the true and subtle remark that the physician had better\\nnot be in robust health   and should have known what illness is in his\\nown person   but the judge ought to have had no similar experience of\\nevil   he is to be a good man who   having passed his youth in innocence  \\nbecame acquainted late in life with the vices of others   and therefore  \\naccording to plato   a judge should not be young   just as a young man\\naccording to aristotle is not fit to be a hearer of moral philosophy  \\nthe bad   on the other hand   have a knowledge of vice   but no knowledge\\nof virtue   it may be doubted   however   whether this train of reflection\\nis well founded   in a remarkable passage of the laws it is acknowledged\\nthat the evil may form a correct estimate of the good   the union of\\ngentleness and courage in book ii   at first seemed to be a paradox   yet\\nwas afterwards ascertained to be a truth   and plato might also have\\nfound that the intuition of evil may be consistent with the abhorrence\\nof it   there is a directness of aim in virtue which gives an insight\\ninto vice   and the knowledge of character is in some degree a natural\\nsense independent of any special experience of good or evil  \\n\\n5   one of the most remarkable conceptions of plato   because un  greek\\nand also very different from anything which existed at all in his age\\nof the world   is the transposition of ranks   in the spartan state there\\nhad been enfranchisement of helots and degradation of citizens under\\nspecial circumstances   and in the ancient greek aristocracies   merit\\nwas certainly recognized as one of the elements on which government was\\nbased   the founders of states were supposed to be their benefactors  \\nwho were raised by their great actions above the ordinary level of\\nhumanity   at a later period   the services of warriors and legislators\\nwere held to entitle them and their descendants to the privileges of\\ncitizenship and to the first rank in the state   and although the\\nexistence of an ideal aristocracy is slenderly proven from the remains\\nof early greek history   and we have a difficulty in ascribing such a\\ncharacter   however the idea may be defined   to any actual hellenic\\nstate—or indeed to any state which has ever existed in the world—still\\nthe rule of the best was certainly the aspiration of philosophers   who\\nprobably accommodated a good deal their views of primitive history to\\ntheir own notions of good government   plato further insists on applying\\nto the guardians of his state a series of tests by which all those who\\nfell short of a fixed standard were either removed from the governing\\nbody   or not admitted to it   and this   academic   discipline did to a\\ncertain extent prevail in greek states   especially in sparta   he also\\nindicates that the system of caste   which existed in a great part of\\nthe ancient   and is by no means extinct in the modern european world  \\nshould be set aside from time to time in favour of merit   he is aware\\nhow deeply the greater part of mankind resent any interference with the\\norder of society   and therefore he proposes his novel idea in the form\\nof what he himself calls a   monstrous fiction       compare the ceremony\\nof preparation for the two   great waves   in book v     two principles are\\nindicated by him   first   that there is a distinction of ranks dependent\\non circumstances prior to the individual   second   that this distinction\\nis and ought to be broken through by personal qualities   he adapts\\nmythology like the homeric poems to the wants of the state   making   the\\nphoenician tale   the vehicle of his ideas   every greek state had a myth\\nrespecting its own origin   the platonic republic may also have a tale\\nof earthborn men   the gravity and verisimilitude with which the tale is\\ntold   and the analogy of greek tradition   are a sufficient verification\\nof the   monstrous falsehood     ancient poetry had spoken of a gold and\\nsilver and brass and iron age succeeding one another   but plato\\nsupposes these differences in the natures of men to exist together in a\\nsingle state   mythology supplies a figure under which the lesson may be\\ntaught   as protagoras says     the myth is more interesting       and also\\nenables plato to touch lightly on new principles without going into\\ndetails   in this passage he shadows forth a general truth   but he does\\nnot tell us by what steps the transposition of ranks is to be effected  \\nindeed throughout the republic he allows the lower ranks to fade into\\nthe distance   we do not know whether they are to carry arms   and\\nwhether in the fifth book they are or are not included in the\\ncommunistic regulations respecting property and marriage   nor is there\\nany use in arguing strictly either from a few chance words   or from the\\nsilence of plato   or in drawing inferences which were beyond his\\nvision   aristotle   in his criticism on the position of the lower\\nclasses   does not perceive that the poetical creation is   like the air  \\ninvulnerable     and cannot be penetrated by the shafts of his logic\\n  pol      \\n\\n6   two paradoxes which strike the modern reader as in the highest\\ndegree fanciful and ideal   and which suggest to him many reflections  \\nare to be found in the third book of the republic   first   the great\\npower of music   so much beyond any influence which is experienced by us\\nin modern times   when the art or science has been far more developed  \\nand has found the secret of harmony   as well as of melody   secondly  \\nthe indefinite and almost absolute control which the soul is supposed\\nto exercise over the body  \\n\\nin the first we suspect some degree of exaggeration   such as we may\\nalso observe among certain masters of the art   not unknown to us   at\\nthe present day   with this natural enthusiasm   which is felt by a few\\nonly   there seems to mingle in plato a sort of pythagorean reverence\\nfor numbers and numerical proportion to which aristotle is a stranger  \\nintervals of sound and number are to him sacred things which have a law\\nof their own   not dependent on the variations of sense   they rise above\\nsense   and become a connecting link with the world of ideas   but it is\\nevident that plato is describing what to him appears to be also a fact  \\nthe power of a simple and characteristic melody on the impressible mind\\nof the greek is more than we can easily appreciate   the effect of\\nnational airs may bear some comparison with it   and   besides all this  \\nthere is a confusion between the harmony of musical notes and the\\nharmony of soul and body   which is so potently inspired by them  \\n\\nthe second paradox leads up to some curious and interesting\\nquestions—how far can the mind control the body   is the relation\\nbetween them one of mutual antagonism or of mutual harmony   are they\\ntwo or one   and is either of them the cause of the other   may we not at\\ntimes drop the opposition between them   and the mode of describing\\nthem   which is so familiar to us   and yet hardly conveys any precise\\nmeaning   and try to view this composite creature   man   in a more simple\\nmanner   must we not at any rate admit that there is in human nature a\\nhigher and a lower principle   divided by no distinct line   which at\\ntimes break asunder and take up arms against one another   or again  \\nthey are reconciled and move together   either unconsciously in the\\nordinary work of life   or consciously in the pursuit of some noble aim  \\nto be attained not without an effort   and for which every thought and\\nnerve are strained   and then the body becomes the good friend or ally  \\nor servant or instrument of the mind   and the mind has often a\\nwonderful and almost superhuman power of banishing disease and weakness\\nand calling out a hidden strength   reason and the desires   the\\nintellect and the senses are brought into harmony and obedience so as\\nto form a single human being   they are ever parting   ever meeting   and\\nthe identity or diversity of their tendencies or operations is for the\\nmost part unnoticed by us   when the mind touches the body through the\\nappetites   we acknowledge the responsibility of the one to the other  \\nthere is a tendency in us which says   drink     there is another which\\nsays     do not drink   it is not good for you     and we all of us know\\nwhich is the rightful superior   we are also responsible for our health  \\nalthough into this sphere there enter some elements of necessity which\\nmay be beyond our control   still even in the management of health   care\\nand thought   continued over many years   may make us almost free agents  \\nif we do not exact too much of ourselves   and if we acknowledge that\\nall human freedom is limited by the laws of nature and of mind  \\n\\nwe are disappointed to find that plato   in the general condemnation\\nwhich he passes on the practice of medicine prevailing in his own day  \\ndepreciates the effects of diet   he would like to have diseases of a\\ndefinite character and capable of receiving a definite treatment   he is\\nafraid of invalidism interfering with the business of life   he does not\\nrecognize that time is the great healer both of mental and bodily\\ndisorders   and that remedies which are gradual and proceed little by\\nlittle are safer than those which produce a sudden catastrophe   neither\\ndoes he see that there is no way in which the mind can more surely\\ninfluence the body than by the control of eating and drinking   or any\\nother action or occasion of human life on which the higher freedom of\\nthe will can be more simple or truly asserted  \\n\\n7   lesser matters of style may be remarked  \\n\\n  1   the affected ignorance of music   which is plato  s way of expressing\\nthat he is passing lightly over the subject  \\n\\n  2   the tentative manner in which here   as in the second book   he\\nproceeds with the construction of the state  \\n\\n  3   the description of the state sometimes as a reality   and then again\\nas a work of imagination only   these are the arts by which he sustains\\nthe reader  s interest  \\n\\n  4   connecting links   or the preparation for the entire expulsion of\\nthe poets in book x  \\n\\n  5   the companion pictures of the lover of litigation and the\\nvaletudinarian   the satirical jest about the maxim of phocylides   the\\nmanner in which the image of the gold and silver citizens is taken up\\ninto the subject   and the argument from the practice of asclepius  \\nshould not escape notice  \\n\\nbook iv   adeimantus said     suppose a person to argue   socrates   that\\nyou make your citizens miserable   and this by their own free  will   they\\nare the lords of the city   and yet instead of having   like other men  \\nlands and houses and money of their own   they live as mercenaries and\\nare always mounting guard     you may add   i replied   that they receive\\nno pay but only their food   and have no money to spend on a journey or\\na mistress     well   and what answer do you give     my answer is   that our\\nguardians may or may not be the happiest of men  —i should not be\\nsurprised to find in the long  run that they were  —but this is not the\\naim of our constitution   which was designed for the good of the whole\\nand not of any one part   if i went to a sculptor and blamed him for\\nhaving painted the eye   which is the noblest feature of the face   not\\npurple but black   he would reply     the eye must be an eye   and you\\nshould look at the statue as a whole       now i can well imagine a fool  s\\nparadise   in which everybody is eating and drinking   clothed in purple\\nand fine linen   and potters lie on sofas and have their wheel at hand  \\nthat they may work a little when they please   and cobblers and all the\\nother classes of a state lose their distinctive character   and a state\\nmay get on without cobblers   but when the guardians degenerate into\\nboon companions   then the ruin is complete   remember that we are not\\ntalking of peasants keeping holiday   but of a state in which every man\\nis expected to do his own work   the happiness resides not in this or\\nthat class   but in the state as a whole   i have another remark to\\nmake  —a middle condition is best for artisans   they should have money\\nenough to buy tools   and not enough to be independent of business   and\\nwill not the same condition be best for our citizens   if they are poor  \\nthey will be mean   if rich   luxurious and lazy   and in neither case\\ncontented     but then how will our poor city be able to go to war\\nagainst an enemy who has money     there may be a difficulty in fighting\\nagainst one enemy   against two there will be none   in the first place  \\nthe contest will be carried on by trained warriors against well  to  do\\ncitizens   and is not a regular athlete an easy match for two stout\\nopponents at least   suppose also   that before engaging we send\\nambassadors to one of the two cities   saying     silver and gold we have\\nnot   do you help us and take our share of the spoil    —who would fight\\nagainst the lean   wiry dogs   when they might join with them in preying\\nupon the fatted sheep     but if many states join their resources   shall\\nwe not be in danger     i am amused to hear you use the word   state   of\\nany but our own state   they are   states     but not   a state  —many in\\none   for in every state there are two hostile nations   rich and poor  \\nwhich you may set one against the other   but our state   while she\\nremains true to her principles   will be in very deed the mightiest of\\nhellenic states  \\n\\nto the size of the state there is no limit but the necessity of unity  \\nit must be neither too large nor too small to be one   this is a matter\\nof secondary importance   like the principle of transposition which was\\nintimated in the parable of the earthborn men   the meaning there\\nimplied was that every man should do that for which he was fitted   and\\nbe at one with himself   and then the whole city would be united   but\\nall these things are secondary   if education   which is the great\\nmatter   be duly regarded   when the wheel has once been set in motion  \\nthe speed is always increasing   and each generation improves upon the\\npreceding   both in physical and moral qualities   the care of the\\ngovernors should be directed to preserve music and gymnastic from\\ninnovation   alter the songs of a country   damon says   and you will soon\\nend by altering its laws   the change appears innocent at first   and\\nbegins in play   but the evil soon becomes serious   working secretly\\nupon the characters of individuals   then upon social and commercial\\nrelations   and lastly upon the institutions of a state   and there is\\nruin and confusion everywhere   but if education remains in the\\nestablished form   there will be no danger   a restorative process will\\nbe always going on   the spirit of law and order will raise up what has\\nfallen down   nor will any regulations be needed for the lesser matters\\nof life—rules of deportment or fashions of dress   like invites like for\\ngood or for evil   education will correct deficiencies and supply the\\npower of self  government   far be it from us to enter into the\\nparticulars of legislation   let the guardians take care of education  \\nand education will take care of all other things  \\n\\nbut without education they may patch and mend as they please   they will\\nmake no progress   any more than a patient who thinks to cure himself by\\nsome favourite remedy and will not give up his luxurious mode of\\nliving   if you tell such persons that they must first alter their\\nhabits   then they grow angry   they are charming people     charming  —nay  \\nthe very reverse     evidently these gentlemen are not in your good\\ngraces   nor the state which is like them   and such states there are\\nwhich first ordain under penalty of death that no one shall alter the\\nconstitution   and then suffer themselves to be flattered into and out\\nof anything   and he who indulges them and fawns upon them   is their\\nleader and saviour     yes   the men are as bad as the states     but do you\\nnot admire their cleverness     nay   some of them are stupid enough to\\nbelieve what the people tell them     and when all the world is telling a\\nman that he is six feet high   and he has no measure   how can he believe\\nanything else   but don  t get into a passion   to see our statesmen\\ntrying their nostrums   and fancying that they can cut off at a blow the\\nhydra  like rogueries of mankind   is as good as a play   minute\\nenactments are superfluous in good states   and are useless in bad ones  \\n\\nand now what remains of the work of legislation   nothing for us   but to\\napollo the god of delphi we leave the ordering of the greatest of all\\nthings—that is to say   religion   only our ancestral deity sitting upon\\nthe centre and navel of the earth will be trusted by us if we have any\\nsense   in an affair of such magnitude   no foreign god shall be supreme\\nin our realms      \\n\\nhere   as socrates would say   let us   reflect on     greek   what has\\npreceded   thus far we have spoken not of the happiness of the citizens  \\nbut only of the well  being of the state   they may be the happiest of\\nmen   but our principal aim in founding the state was not to make them\\nhappy   they were to be guardians   not holiday  makers   in this pleasant\\nmanner is presented to us the famous question both of ancient and\\nmodern philosophy   touching the relation of duty to happiness   of right\\nto utility  \\n\\nfirst duty   then happiness   is the natural order of our moral ideas  \\nthe utilitarian principle is valuable as a corrective of error   and\\nshows to us a side of ethics which is apt to be neglected   it may be\\nadmitted further that right and utility are co  extensive   and that he\\nwho makes the happiness of mankind his object has one of the highest\\nand noblest motives of human action   but utility is not the historical\\nbasis of morality   nor the aspect in which moral and religious ideas\\ncommonly occur to the mind   the greatest happiness of all is   as we\\nbelieve   the far  off result of the divine government of the universe  \\nthe greatest happiness of the individual is certainly to be found in a\\nlife of virtue and goodness   but we seem to be more assured of a law of\\nright than we can be of a divine purpose   that   all mankind should be\\nsaved     and we infer the one from the other   and the greatest happiness\\nof the individual may be the reverse of the greatest happiness in the\\nordinary sense of the term   and may be realised in a life of pain   or\\nin a voluntary death   further   the word   happiness   has several\\nambiguities   it may mean either pleasure or an ideal life   happiness\\nsubjective or objective   in this world or in another   of ourselves only\\nor of our neighbours and of all men everywhere   by the modern founder\\nof utilitarianism the self  regarding and disinterested motives of\\naction are included under the same term   although they are commonly\\nopposed by us as benevolence and self  love   the word happiness has not\\nthe definiteness or the sacredness of   truth   and   right     it does not\\nequally appeal to our higher nature   and has not sunk into the\\nconscience of mankind   it is associated too much with the comforts and\\nconveniences of life   too little with   the goods of the soul which we\\ndesire for their own sake     in a great trial   or danger   or temptation  \\nor in any great and heroic action   it is scarcely thought of   for these\\nreasons   the greatest happiness   principle is not the true foundation\\nof ethics   but though not the first principle   it is the second   which\\nis like unto it   and is often of easier application   for the larger\\npart of human actions are neither right nor wrong   except in so far as\\nthey tend to the happiness of mankind   introd   to gorgias and\\nphilebus    \\n\\nthe same question reappears in politics   where the useful or expedient\\nseems to claim a larger sphere and to have a greater authority   for\\nconcerning political measures   we chiefly ask   how will they affect the\\nhappiness of mankind   yet here too we may observe that what we term\\nexpediency is merely the law of right limited by the conditions of\\nhuman society   right and truth are the highest aims of government as\\nwell as of individuals   and we ought not to lose sight of them because\\nwe cannot directly enforce them   they appeal to the better mind of\\nnations   and sometimes they are too much for merely temporal interests\\nto resist   they are the watchwords which all men use in matters of\\npublic policy   as well as in their private dealings   the peace of\\neurope may be said to depend upon them   in the most commercial and\\nutilitarian states of society the power of ideas remains   and all the\\nhigher class of statesmen have in them something of that idealism which\\npericles is said to have gathered from the teaching of anaxagoras   they\\nrecognise that the true leader of men must be above the motives of\\nambition   and that national character is of greater value than material\\ncomfort and prosperity   and this is the order of thought in plato  \\nfirst   he expects his citizens to do their duty   and then under\\nfavourable circumstances   that is to say   in a well  ordered state  \\ntheir happiness is assured   that he was far from excluding the modern\\nprinciple of utility in politics is sufficiently evident from other\\npassages   in which   the most beneficial is affirmed to be the most\\nhonourable     and also   the most sacred    \\n\\nwe may note\\n\\n  1   the manner in which the objection of adeimantus here   is designed\\nto draw out and deepen the argument of socrates  \\n\\n  2   the conception of a whole as lying at the foundation both of\\npolitics and of art   in the latter supplying the only principle of\\ncriticism   which   under the various names of harmony   symmetry  \\nmeasure   proportion   unity   the greek seems to have applied to works of\\nart  \\n\\n  3   the requirement that the state should be limited in size   after the\\ntraditional model of a greek state   as in the politics of aristotle  \\nthe fact that the cities of hellas were small is converted into a\\nprinciple  \\n\\n  4   the humorous pictures of the lean dogs and the fatted sheep   of the\\nlight active boxer upsetting two stout gentlemen at least   of the\\n  charming   patients who are always making themselves worse   or again  \\nthe playful assumption that there is no state but our own   or the grave\\nirony with which the statesman is excused who believes that he is six\\nfeet high because he is told so   and having nothing to measure with is\\nto be pardoned for his ignorance—he is too amusing for us to be\\nseriously angry with him  \\n\\n  5   the light and superficial manner in which religion is passed over\\nwhen provision has been made for two great principles  —first   that\\nreligion shall be based on the highest conception of the gods  \\nsecondly   that the true national or hellenic type shall be\\nmaintained      \\n\\nsocrates proceeds   but where amid all this is justice   son of ariston  \\ntell me where   light a candle and search the city   and get your brother\\nand the rest of our friends to help in seeking for her     that won  t\\ndo     replied glaucon     you yourself promised to make the search and\\ntalked about the impiety of deserting justice     well   i said   i will\\nlead the way   but do you follow   my notion is   that our state being\\nperfect will contain all the four virtues—wisdom   courage   temperance  \\njustice   if we eliminate the three first   the unknown remainder will be\\njustice  \\n\\nfirst then   of wisdom   the state which we have called into being will\\nbe wise because politic   and policy is one among many kinds of\\nskill  —not the skill of the carpenter   or of the worker in metal   or of\\nthe husbandman   but the skill of him who advises about the interests of\\nthe whole state   of such a kind is the skill of the guardians   who are\\na small class in number   far smaller than the blacksmiths   but in them\\nis concentrated the wisdom of the state   and if this small ruling class\\nhave wisdom   then the whole state will be wise  \\n\\nour second virtue is courage   which we have no difficulty in finding in\\nanother class—that of soldiers   courage may be defined as a sort of\\nsalvation—the never  failing salvation of the opinions which law and\\neducation have prescribed concerning dangers   you know the way in which\\ndyers first prepare the white ground and then lay on the dye of purple\\nor of any other colour   colours dyed in this way become fixed   and no\\nsoap or lye will ever wash them out   now the ground is education   and\\nthe laws are the colours   and if the ground is properly laid   neither\\nthe soap of pleasure nor the lye of pain or fear will ever wash them\\nout   this power which preserves right opinion about danger i would ask\\nyou to call   courage     adding the epithet   political   or   civilized   in\\norder to distinguish it from mere animal courage and from a higher\\ncourage which may hereafter be discussed  \\n\\ntwo virtues remain   temperance and justice   more than the preceding\\nvirtues temperance suggests the idea of harmony   some light is thrown\\nupon the nature of this virtue by the popular description of a man as\\n  master of himself  —which has an absurd sound   because the master is\\nalso the servant   the expression really means that the better principle\\nin a man masters the worse   there are in cities whole classes—women  \\nslaves and the like—who correspond to the worse   and a few only to the\\nbetter   and in our state the former class are held under control by the\\nlatter   now to which of these classes does temperance belong     to both\\nof them     and our state if any will be the abode of temperance   and we\\nwere right in describing this virtue as a harmony which is diffused\\nthrough the whole   making the dwellers in the city to be of one mind  \\nand attuning the upper and middle and lower classes like the strings of\\nan instrument   whether you suppose them to differ in wisdom   strength\\nor wealth  \\n\\nand now we are near the spot   let us draw in and surround the cover and\\nwatch with all our eyes   lest justice should slip away and escape   tell\\nme   if you see the thicket move first     nay   i would have you lead    \\nwell then   offer up a prayer and follow   the way is dark and difficult  \\nbut we must push on   i begin to see a track     good news     why   glaucon  \\nour dulness of scent is quite ludicrous   while we are straining our\\neyes into the distance   justice is tumbling out at our feet   we are as\\nbad as people looking for a thing which they have in their hands   have\\nyou forgotten our old principle of the division of labour   or of every\\nman doing his own business   concerning which we spoke at the foundation\\nof the state—what but this was justice   is there any other virtue\\nremaining which can compete with wisdom and temperance and courage in\\nthe scale of political virtue   for   every one having his own   is the\\ngreat object of government   and the great object of trade is that every\\nman should do his own business   not that there is much harm in a\\ncarpenter trying to be a cobbler   or a cobbler transforming himself\\ninto a carpenter   but great evil may arise from the cobbler leaving his\\nlast and turning into a guardian or legislator   or when a single\\nindividual is trainer   warrior   legislator   all in one   and this evil\\nis injustice   or every man doing another  s business   i do not say that\\nas yet we are in a condition to arrive at a final conclusion   for the\\ndefinition which we believe to hold good in states has still to be\\ntested by the individual   having read the large letters we will now\\ncome back to the small   from the two together a brilliant light may be\\nstruck out      \\n\\nsocrates proceeds to discover the nature of justice by a method of\\nresidues   each of the first three virtues corresponds to one of the\\nthree parts of the soul and one of the three classes in the state  \\nalthough the third   temperance   has more of the nature of a harmony\\nthan the first two   if there be a fourth virtue   that can only be\\nsought for in the relation of the three parts in the soul or classes in\\nthe state to one another   it is obvious and simple   and for that very\\nreason has not been found out   the modern logician will be inclined to\\nobject that ideas cannot be separated like chemical substances   but\\nthat they run into one another and may be only different aspects or\\nnames of the same thing   and such in this instance appears to be the\\ncase   for the definition here given of justice is verbally the same as\\none of the definitions of temperance given by socrates in the\\ncharmides   which however is only provisional   and is afterwards\\nrejected   and so far from justice remaining over when the other virtues\\nare eliminated   the justice and temperance of the republic can with\\ndifficulty be distinguished   temperance appears to be the virtue of a\\npart only   and one of three   whereas justice is a universal virtue of\\nthe whole soul   yet on the other hand temperance is also described as a\\nsort of harmony   and in this respect is akin to justice   justice seems\\nto differ from temperance in degree rather than in kind   whereas\\ntemperance is the harmony of discordant elements   justice is the\\nperfect order by which all natures and classes do their own business  \\nthe right man in the right place   the division and co  operation of all\\nthe citizens   justice   again   is a more abstract notion than the other\\nvirtues   and therefore   from plato  s point of view   the foundation of\\nthem   to which they are referred and which in idea precedes them   the\\nproposal to omit temperance is a mere trick of style intended to avoid\\nmonotony  \\n\\nthere is a famous question discussed in one of the earlier dialogues of\\nplato   protagoras   arist   nic   ethics       whether the virtues are one or\\nmany     this receives an answer which is to the effect that there are\\nfour cardinal virtues   now for the first time brought together in\\nethical philosophy     and one supreme over the rest   which is not like\\naristotle  s conception of universal justice   virtue relative to others  \\nbut the whole of virtue relative to the parts   to this universal\\nconception of justice or order in the first education and in the moral\\nnature of man   the still more universal conception of the good in the\\nsecond education and in the sphere of speculative knowledge seems to\\nsucceed   both might be equally described by the terms   law       order    \\n  harmony     but while the idea of good embraces   all time and all\\nexistence     the conception of justice is not extended beyond man  \\n\\n      socrates is now going to identify the individual and the state   but\\nfirst he must prove that there are three parts of the individual soul  \\nhis argument is as follows  —quantity makes no difference in quality  \\nthe word   just     whether applied to the individual or to the state   has\\nthe same meaning   and the term   justice   implied that the same three\\nprinciples in the state and in the individual were doing their own\\nbusiness   but are they really three or one   the question is difficult  \\nand one which can hardly be solved by the methods which we are now\\nusing   but the truer and longer way would take up too much of our time  \\n  the shorter will satisfy me     well then   you would admit that the\\nqualities of states mean the qualities of the individuals who compose\\nthem   the scythians and thracians are passionate   our own race\\nintellectual   and the egyptians and phoenicians covetous   because the\\nindividual members of each have such and such a character   the\\ndifficulty is to determine whether the several principles are one or\\nthree   whether   that is to say   we reason with one part of our nature  \\ndesire with another   are angry with another   or whether the whole soul\\ncomes into play in each sort of action   this enquiry   however   requires\\na very exact definition of terms   the same thing in the same relation\\ncannot be affected in two opposite ways   but there is no impossibility\\nin a man standing still   yet moving his arms   or in a top which is\\nfixed on one spot going round upon its axis   there is no necessity to\\nmention all the possible exceptions   let us provisionally assume that\\nopposites cannot do or be or suffer opposites in the same relation   and\\nto the class of opposites belong assent and dissent   desire and\\navoidance   and one form of desire is thirst and hunger   and here arises\\na new point—thirst is thirst of drink   hunger is hunger of food   not of\\nwarm drink or of a particular kind of food   with the single exception\\nof course that the very fact of our desiring anything implies that it\\nis good   when relative terms have no attributes   their correlatives\\nhave no attributes   when they have attributes   their correlatives also\\nhave them   for example   the term   greater   is simply relative to\\n  less     and knowledge refers to a subject of knowledge   but on the\\nother hand   a particular knowledge is of a particular subject   again  \\nevery science has a distinct character   which is defined by an object  \\nmedicine   for example   is the science of health   although not to be\\nconfounded with health   having cleared our ideas thus far   let us\\nreturn to the original instance of thirst   which has a definite\\nobject—drink   now the thirsty soul may feel two distinct impulses   the\\nanimal one saying   drink     the rational one   which says   do not drink    \\nthe two impulses are contradictory   and therefore we may assume that\\nthey spring from distinct principles in the soul   but is passion a\\nthird principle   or akin to desire   there is a story of a certain\\nleontius which throws some light on this question   he was coming up\\nfrom the piraeus outside the north wall   and he passed a spot where\\nthere were dead bodies lying by the executioner   he felt a longing\\ndesire to see them and also an abhorrence of them   at first he turned\\naway and shut his eyes   then   suddenly tearing them open   he\\nsaid  —  take your fill   ye wretches   of the fair sight     now is there\\nnot here a third principle which is often found to come to the\\nassistance of reason against desire   but never of desire against\\nreason   this is passion or spirit   of the separate existence of which\\nwe may further convince ourselves by putting the following case  —when a\\nman suffers justly   if he be of a generous nature he is not indignant\\nat the hardships which he undergoes   but when he suffers unjustly   his\\nindignation is his great support   hunger and thirst cannot tame him  \\nthe spirit within him must do or die   until the voice of the shepherd  \\nthat is   of reason   bidding his dog bark no more   is heard within   this\\nshows that passion is the ally of reason   is passion then the same with\\nreason   no   for the former exists in children and brutes   and homer\\naffords a proof of the distinction between them when he says     he smote\\nhis breast   and thus rebuked his soul    \\n\\nand now   at last   we have reached firm ground   and are able to infer\\nthat the virtues of the state and of the individual are the same   for\\nwisdom and courage and justice in the state are severally the wisdom\\nand courage and justice in the individuals who form the state   each of\\nthe three classes will do the work of its own class in the state   and\\neach part in the individual soul   reason   the superior   and passion  \\nthe inferior   will be harmonized by the influence of music and\\ngymnastic   the counsellor and the warrior   the head and the arm   will\\nact together in the town of mansoul   and keep the desires in proper\\nsubjection   the courage of the warrior is that quality which preserves\\na right opinion about dangers in spite of pleasures and pains   the\\nwisdom of the counsellor is that small part of the soul which has\\nauthority and reason   the virtue of temperance is the friendship of the\\nruling and the subject principles   both in the state and in the\\nindividual   of justice we have already spoken   and the notion already\\ngiven of it may be confirmed by common instances   will the just state\\nor the just individual steal   lie   commit adultery   or be guilty of\\nimpiety to gods and men     no     and is not the reason of this that the\\nseveral principles   whether in the state or in the individual   do their\\nown business   and justice is the quality which makes just men and just\\nstates   moreover   our old division of labour   which required that there\\nshould be one man for one use   was a dream or anticipation of what was\\nto follow   and that dream has now been realized in justice   which\\nbegins by binding together the three chords of the soul   and then acts\\nharmoniously in every relation of life   and injustice   which is the\\ninsubordination and disobedience of the inferior elements in the soul  \\nis the opposite of justice   and is inharmonious and unnatural   being to\\nthe soul what disease is to the body   for in the soul as well as in the\\nbody   good or bad actions produce good or bad habits   and virtue is the\\nhealth and beauty and well  being of the soul   and vice is the disease\\nand weakness and deformity of the soul  \\n\\nagain the old question returns upon us   is justice or injustice the\\nmore profitable   the question has become ridiculous   for injustice  \\nlike mortal disease   makes life not worth having   come up with me to\\nthe hill which overhangs the city and look down upon the single form of\\nvirtue   and the infinite forms of vice   among which are four special\\nones   characteristic both of states and of individuals   and the state\\nwhich corresponds to the single form of virtue is that which we have\\nbeen describing   wherein reason rules under one of two names—monarchy\\nand aristocracy   thus there are five forms in all   both of states and\\nof souls      \\n\\nin attempting to prove that the soul has three separate faculties  \\nplato takes occasion to discuss what makes difference of faculties   and\\nthe criterion which he proposes is difference in the working of the\\nfaculties   the same faculty cannot produce contradictory effects   but\\nthe path of early reasoners is beset by thorny entanglements   and he\\nwill not proceed a step without first clearing the ground   this leads\\nhim into a tiresome digression   which is intended to explain the nature\\nof contradiction   first   the contradiction must be at the same time and\\nin the same relation   secondly   no extraneous word must be introduced\\ninto either of the terms in which the contradictory proposition is\\nexpressed   for example   thirst is of drink   not of warm drink   he\\nimplies   what he does not say   that if   by the advice of reason   or by\\nthe impulse of anger   a man is restrained from drinking   this proves\\nthat thirst   or desire under which thirst is included   is distinct from\\nanger and reason   but suppose that we allow the term   thirst   or\\n  desire   to be modified   and say an   angry thirst     or a   revengeful\\ndesire     then the two spheres of desire and anger overlap and become\\nconfused   this case therefore has to be excluded   and still there\\nremains an exception to the rule in the use of the term   good     which\\nis always implied in the object of desire   these are the discussions of\\nan age before logic   and any one who is wearied by them should remember\\nthat they are necessary to the clearing up of ideas in the first\\ndevelopment of the human faculties  \\n\\nthe psychology of plato extends no further than the division of the\\nsoul into the rational   irascible   and concupiscent elements   which   as\\nfar as we know   was first made by him   and has been retained by\\naristotle and succeeding ethical writers   the chief difficulty in this\\nearly analysis of the mind is to define exactly the place of the\\nirascible faculty   greek     which may be variously described under the\\nterms righteous indignation   spirit   passion   it is the foundation of\\ncourage   which includes in plato moral courage   the courage of enduring\\npain   and of surmounting intellectual difficulties   as well as of\\nmeeting dangers in war   though irrational   it inclines to side with the\\nrational   it cannot be aroused by punishment when justly inflicted   it\\nsometimes takes the form of an enthusiasm which sustains a man in the\\nperformance of great actions   it is the   lion heart   with which the\\nreason makes a treaty   on the other hand it is negative rather than\\npositive   it is indignant at wrong or falsehood   but does not   like\\nlove in the symposium and phaedrus   aspire to the vision of truth or\\ngood   it is the peremptory military spirit which prevails in the\\ngovernment of honour   it differs from anger   greek     this latter term\\nhaving no accessory notion of righteous indignation   although aristotle\\nhas retained the word   yet we may observe that   passion     greek   has\\nwith him lost its affinity to the rational and has become\\nindistinguishable from   anger     greek     and to this vernacular use\\nplato himself in the laws seems to revert   though not always   by modern\\nphilosophy too   as well as in our ordinary conversation   the words\\nanger or passion are employed almost exclusively in a bad sense   there\\nis no connotation of a just or reasonable cause by which they are\\naroused   the feeling of   righteous indignation   is too partial and\\naccidental to admit of our regarding it as a separate virtue or habit  \\nwe are tempted also to doubt whether plato is right in supposing that\\nan offender   however justly condemned   could be expected to acknowledge\\nthe justice of his sentence   this is the spirit of a philosopher or\\nmartyr rather than of a criminal  \\n\\nwe may observe how nearly plato approaches aristotle  s famous thesis  \\nthat   good actions produce good habits     the words   as healthy\\npractices   greek   produce health   so do just practices produce\\njustice     have a sound very like the nicomachean ethics   but we note\\nalso that an incidental remark in plato has become a far  reaching\\nprinciple in aristotle   and an inseparable part of a great ethical\\nsystem  \\n\\nthere is a difficulty in understanding what plato meant by   the longer\\nway     he seems to intimate some metaphysic of the future which will not\\nbe satisfied with arguing from the principle of contradiction   in the\\nsixth and seventh books   compare sophist and parmenides   he has given\\nus a sketch of such a metaphysic   but when glaucon asks for the final\\nrevelation of the idea of good   he is put off with the declaration that\\nhe has not yet studied the preliminary sciences   how he would have\\nfilled up the sketch   or argued about such questions from a higher\\npoint of view   we can only conjecture   perhaps he hoped to find some a\\npriori method of developing the parts out of the whole   or he might\\nhave asked which of the ideas contains the other ideas   and possibly\\nhave stumbled on the hegelian identity of the   ego   and the\\n  universal     or he may have imagined that ideas might be constructed in\\nsome manner analogous to the construction of figures and numbers in the\\nmathematical sciences   the most certain and necessary truth was to\\nplato the universal   and to this he was always seeking to refer all\\nknowledge or opinion   just as in modern times we seek to rest them on\\nthe opposite pole of induction and experience   the aspirations of\\nmetaphysicians have always tended to pass beyond the limits of human\\nthought and language   they seem to have reached a height at which they\\nare   moving about in worlds unrealized     and their conceptions  \\nalthough profoundly affecting their own minds   become invisible or\\nunintelligible to others   we are not therefore surprized to find that\\nplato himself has nowhere clearly explained his doctrine of ideas   or\\nthat his school in a later generation   like his contemporaries glaucon\\nand adeimantus   were unable to follow him in this region of\\nspeculation   in the sophist   where he is refuting the scepticism which\\nmaintained either that there was no such thing as predication   or that\\nall might be predicated of all   he arrives at the conclusion that some\\nideas combine with some   but not all with all   but he makes only one or\\ntwo steps forward on this path   he nowhere attains to any connected\\nsystem of ideas   or even to a knowledge of the most elementary\\nrelations of the sciences to one another  \\n\\nbook v   i was going to enumerate the four forms of vice or decline in\\nstates   when polemarchus—he was sitting a little farther from me than\\nadeimantus—taking him by the coat and leaning towards him   said\\nsomething in an undertone   of which i only caught the words     shall we\\nlet him off       certainly not     said adeimantus   raising his voice  \\nwhom   i said   are you not going to let off     you     he said   why  \\n  because we think that you are not dealing fairly with us in omitting\\nwomen and children   of whom you have slily disposed under the general\\nformula that friends have all things in common     and was i not right  \\n  yes     he replied     but there are many sorts of communism or community  \\nand we want to know which of them is right   the company   as you have\\njust heard   are resolved to have a further explanation     thrasymachus\\nsaid     do you think that we have come hither to dig for gold   or to\\nhear you discourse     yes   i said   but the discourse should be of a\\nreasonable length   glaucon added     yes   socrates   and there is reason\\nin spending the whole of life in such discussions   but pray   without\\nmore ado   tell us how this community is to be carried out   and how the\\ninterval between birth and education is to be filled up     well   i said  \\nthe subject has several difficulties—what is possible   is the first\\nquestion   what is desirable   is the second     fear not     he replied  \\n  for you are speaking among friends     that   i replied   is a sorry\\nconsolation   i shall destroy my friends as well as myself   not that i\\nmind a little innocent laughter   but he who kills the truth is a\\nmurderer     then     said glaucon   laughing     in case you should murder us\\nwe will acquit you beforehand   and you shall be held free from the\\nguilt of deceiving us    \\n\\nsocrates proceeds  —the guardians of our state are to be watch  dogs   as\\nwe have already said   now dogs are not divided into hes and shes—we do\\nnot take the masculine gender out to hunt and leave the females at home\\nto look after their puppies   they have the same employments—the only\\ndifference between them is that the one sex is stronger and the other\\nweaker   but if women are to have the same employments as men   they must\\nhave the same education—they must be taught music and gymnastics   and\\nthe art of war   i know that a great joke will be made of their riding\\non horseback and carrying weapons   the sight of the naked old wrinkled\\nwomen showing their agility in the palaestra will certainly not be a\\nvision of beauty   and may be expected to become a famous jest   but we\\nmust not mind the wits   there was a time when they might have laughed\\nat our present gymnastics   all is habit   people have at last found out\\nthat the exposure is better than the concealment of the person   and now\\nthey laugh no more   evil only should be the subject of ridicule  \\n\\nthe first question is   whether women are able either wholly or\\npartially to share in the employments of men   and here we may be\\ncharged with inconsistency in making the proposal at all   for we\\nstarted originally with the division of labour   and the diversity of\\nemployments was based on the difference of natures   but is there no\\ndifference between men and women   nay   are they not wholly different  \\nthere was the difficulty   glaucon   which made me unwilling to speak of\\nfamily relations   however   when a man is out of his depth   whether in a\\npool or in an ocean   he can only swim for his life   and we must try to\\nfind a way of escape   if we can  \\n\\nthe argument is   that different natures have different uses   and the\\nnatures of men and women are said to differ   but this is only a verbal\\nopposition   we do not consider that the difference may be purely\\nnominal and accidental   for example   a bald man and a hairy man are\\nopposed in a single point of view   but you cannot infer that because a\\nbald man is a cobbler a hairy man ought not to be a cobbler   now why is\\nsuch an inference erroneous   simply because the opposition between them\\nis partial only   like the difference between a male physician and a\\nfemale physician   not running through the whole nature   like the\\ndifference between a physician and a carpenter   and if the difference\\nof the sexes is only that the one beget and the other bear children  \\nthis does not prove that they ought to have distinct educations  \\nadmitting that women differ from men in capacity   do not men equally\\ndiffer from one another   has not nature scattered all the qualities\\nwhich our citizens require indifferently up and down among the two\\nsexes   and even in their peculiar pursuits   are not women often   though\\nin some cases superior to men   ridiculously enough surpassed by them  \\nwomen are the same in kind as men   and have the same aptitude or want\\nof aptitude for medicine or gymnastic or war   but in a less degree   one\\nwoman will be a good guardian   another not   and the good must be chosen\\nto be the colleagues of our guardians   if however their natures are the\\nsame   the inference is that their education must also be the same  \\nthere is no longer anything unnatural or impossible in a woman learning\\nmusic and gymnastic   and the education which we give them will be the\\nvery best   far superior to that of cobblers   and will train up the very\\nbest women   and nothing can be more advantageous to the state than\\nthis   therefore let them strip   clothed in their chastity   and share in\\nthe toils of war and in the defence of their country   he who laughs at\\nthem is a fool for his pains  \\n\\nthe first wave is past   and the argument is compelled to admit that men\\nand women have common duties and pursuits   a second and greater wave is\\nrolling in—community of wives and children   is this either expedient or\\npossible   the expediency i do not doubt   i am not so sure of the\\npossibility     nay   i think that a considerable doubt will be\\nentertained on both points     i meant to have escaped the trouble of\\nproving the first   but as you have detected the little stratagem i must\\neven submit   only allow me to feed my fancy like the solitary in his\\nwalks   with a dream of what might be   and then i will return to the\\nquestion of what can be  \\n\\nin the first place our rulers will enforce the laws and make new ones\\nwhere they are wanted   and their allies or ministers will obey   you   as\\nlegislator   have already selected the men   and now you shall select the\\nwomen   after the selection has been made   they will dwell in common\\nhouses and have their meals in common   and will be brought together by\\na necessity more certain than that of mathematics   but they cannot be\\nallowed to live in licentiousness   that is an unholy thing   which the\\nrulers are determined to prevent   for the avoidance of this   holy\\nmarriage festivals will be instituted   and their holiness will be in\\nproportion to their usefulness   and here   glaucon   i should like to ask\\n  as i know that you are a breeder of birds and animals     do you not\\ntake the greatest care in the mating     certainly     and there is no\\nreason to suppose that less care is required in the marriage of human\\nbeings   but then our rulers must be skilful physicians of the state  \\nfor they will often need a strong dose of falsehood in order to bring\\nabout desirable unions between their subjects   the good must be paired\\nwith the good   and the bad with the bad   and the offspring of the one\\nmust be reared   and of the other destroyed   in this way the flock will\\nbe preserved in prime condition   hymeneal festivals will be celebrated\\nat times fixed with an eye to population   and the brides and\\nbridegrooms will meet at them   and by an ingenious system of lots the\\nrulers will contrive that the brave and the fair come together   and\\nthat those of inferior breed are paired with inferiors—the latter will\\nascribe to chance what is really the invention of the rulers   and when\\nchildren are born   the offspring of the brave and fair will be carried\\nto an enclosure in a certain part of the city   and there attended by\\nsuitable nurses   the rest will be hurried away to places unknown   the\\nmothers will be brought to the fold and will suckle the children   care\\nhowever must be taken that none of them recognise their own offspring  \\nand if necessary other nurses may also be hired   the trouble of\\nwatching and getting up at night will be transferred to attendants  \\n  then the wives of our guardians will have a fine easy time when they\\nare having children     and quite right too   i said   that they should  \\n\\nthe parents ought to be in the prime of life   which for a man may be\\nreckoned at thirty years—from twenty  five   when he has   passed the\\npoint at which the speed of life is greatest     to fifty  five   and at\\ntwenty years for a woman—from twenty to forty   any one above or below\\nthose ages who partakes in the hymeneals shall be guilty of impiety  \\nalso every one who forms a marriage connexion at other times without\\nthe consent of the rulers   this latter regulation applies to those who\\nare within the specified ages   after which they may range at will  \\nprovided they avoid the prohibited degrees of parents and children   or\\nof brothers and sisters   which last   however   are not absolutely\\nprohibited   if a dispensation be procured     but how shall we know the\\ndegrees of affinity   when all things are common     the answer is   that\\nbrothers and sisters are all such as are born seven or nine months\\nafter the espousals   and their parents those who are then espoused   and\\nevery one will have many children and every child many parents  \\n\\nsocrates proceeds   i have now to prove that this scheme is advantageous\\nand also consistent with our entire polity   the greatest good of a\\nstate is unity   the greatest evil   discord and distraction   and there\\nwill be unity where there are no private pleasures or pains or\\ninterests—where if one member suffers all the members suffer   if one\\ncitizen is touched all are quickly sensitive   and the least hurt to the\\nlittle finger of the state runs through the whole body and vibrates to\\nthe soul   for the true state   like an individual   is injured as a whole\\nwhen any part is affected   every state has subjects and rulers   who in\\na democracy are called rulers   and in other states masters   but in our\\nstate they are called saviours and allies   and the subjects who in\\nother states are termed slaves   are by us termed nurturers and\\npaymasters   and those who are termed comrades and colleagues in other\\nplaces   are by us called fathers and brothers   and whereas in other\\nstates members of the same government regard one of their colleagues as\\na friend and another as an enemy   in our state no man is a stranger to\\nanother   for every citizen is connected with every other by ties of\\nblood   and these names and this way of speaking will have a\\ncorresponding reality—brother   father   sister   mother   repeated from\\ninfancy in the ears of children   will not be mere words   then again the\\ncitizens will have all things in common   in having common property they\\nwill have common pleasures and pains  \\n\\ncan there be strife and contention among those who are of one mind   or\\nlawsuits about property when men have nothing but their bodies which\\nthey call their own   or suits about violence when every one is bound to\\ndefend himself   the permission to strike when insulted will be an\\n  antidote   to the knife and will prevent disturbances in the state   but\\nno younger man will strike an elder   reverence will prevent him from\\nlaying hands on his kindred   and he will fear that the rest of the\\nfamily may retaliate   moreover   our citizens will be rid of the lesser\\nevils of life   there will be no flattery of the rich   no sordid\\nhousehold cares   no borrowing and not paying   compared with the\\ncitizens of other states   ours will be olympic victors   and crowned\\nwith blessings greater still—they and their children having a better\\nmaintenance during life   and after death an honourable burial   nor has\\nthe happiness of the individual been sacrificed to the happiness of the\\nstate   our olympic victor has not been turned into a cobbler   but he\\nhas a happiness beyond that of any cobbler   at the same time   if any\\nconceited youth begins to dream of appropriating the state to himself  \\nhe must be reminded that   half is better than the whole       i should\\ncertainly advise him to stay where he is when he has the promise of\\nsuch a brave life    \\n\\nbut is such a community possible  —as among the animals   so also among\\nmen   and if possible   in what way possible   about war there is no\\ndifficulty   the principle of communism is adapted to military service  \\nparents will take their children to look on at a battle   just as\\npotters   boys are trained to the business by looking on at the wheel  \\nand to the parents themselves   as to other animals   the sight of their\\nyoung ones will prove a great incentive to bravery   young warriors must\\nlearn   but they must not run into danger   although a certain degree of\\nrisk is worth incurring when the benefit is great   the young creatures\\nshould be placed under the care of experienced veterans   and they\\nshould have wings—that is to say   swift and tractable steeds on which\\nthey may fly away and escape   one of the first things to be done is to\\nteach a youth to ride  \\n\\ncowards and deserters shall be degraded to the class of husbandmen  \\ngentlemen who allow themselves to be taken prisoners   may be presented\\nto the enemy   but what shall be done to the hero   first of all he shall\\nbe crowned by all the youths in the army   secondly   he shall receive\\nthe right hand of fellowship   and thirdly   do you think that there is\\nany harm in his being kissed   we have already determined that he shall\\nhave more wives than others   in order that he may have as many children\\nas possible   and at a feast he shall have more to eat   we have the\\nauthority of homer for honouring brave men with   long chines     which is\\nan appropriate compliment   because meat is a very strengthening thing  \\nfill the bowl then   and give the best seats and meats to the brave—may\\nthey do them good   and he who dies in battle will be at once declared\\nto be of the golden race   and will   as we believe   become one of\\nhesiod  s guardian angels   he shall be worshipped after death in the\\nmanner prescribed by the oracle   and not only he   but all other\\nbenefactors of the state who die in any other way   shall be admitted to\\nthe same honours  \\n\\nthe next question is   how shall we treat our enemies   shall hellenes be\\nenslaved   no   for there is too great a risk of the whole race passing\\nunder the yoke of the barbarians   or shall the dead be despoiled  \\ncertainly not   for that sort of thing is an excuse for skulking   and\\nhas been the ruin of many an army   there is meanness and feminine\\nmalice in making an enemy of the dead body   when the soul which was the\\nowner has fled—like a dog who cannot reach his assailants   and quarrels\\nwith the stones which are thrown at him instead   again   the arms of\\nhellenes should not be offered up in the temples of the gods   they are\\na pollution   for they are taken from brethren   and on similar grounds\\nthere should be a limit to the devastation of hellenic territory—the\\nhouses should not be burnt   nor more than the annual produce carried\\noff   for war is of two kinds   civil and foreign   the first of which is\\nproperly termed   discord     and only the second   war     and war between\\nhellenes is in reality civil war—a quarrel in a family   which is ever\\nto be regarded as unpatriotic and unnatural   and ought to be prosecuted\\nwith a view to reconciliation in a true phil  hellenic spirit   as of\\nthose who would chasten but not utterly enslave   the war is not against\\na whole nation who are a friendly multitude of men   women   and\\nchildren   but only against a few guilty persons   when they are punished\\npeace will be restored   that is the way in which hellenes should war\\nagainst one another—and against barbarians   as they war against one\\nanother now  \\n\\n  but   my dear socrates   you are forgetting the main question   is such a\\nstate possible   i grant all and more than you say about the blessedness\\nof being one family—fathers   brothers   mothers   daughters   going out to\\nwar together   but i want to ascertain the possibility of this ideal\\nstate     you are too unmerciful   the first wave and the second wave i\\nhave hardly escaped   and now you will certainly drown me with the\\nthird   when you see the towering crest of the wave   i expect you to\\ntake pity     not a whit    \\n\\nwell   then   we were led to form our ideal polity in the search after\\njustice   and the just man answered to the just state   is this ideal at\\nall the worse for being impracticable   would the picture of a perfectly\\nbeautiful man be any the worse because no such man ever lived   can any\\nreality come up to the idea   nature will not allow words to be fully\\nrealized   but if i am to try and realize the ideal of the state in a\\nmeasure   i think that an approach may be made to the perfection of\\nwhich i dream by one or two   i do not say slight   but possible changes\\nin the present constitution of states   i would reduce them to a single\\none—the great wave   as i call it   until   then   kings are philosophers  \\nor philosophers are kings   cities will never cease from ill   no   nor\\nthe human race   nor will our ideal polity ever come into being   i know\\nthat this is a hard saying   which few will be able to receive  \\n  socrates   all the world will take off his coat and rush upon you with\\nsticks and stones   and therefore i would advise you to prepare an\\nanswer     you got me into the scrape   i said     and i was right     he\\nreplied     however   i will stand by you as a sort of do  nothing  \\nwell  meaning ally     having the help of such a champion   i will do my\\nbest to maintain my position   and first   i must explain of whom i speak\\nand what sort of natures these are who are to be philosophers and\\nrulers   as you are a man of pleasure   you will not have forgotten how\\nindiscriminate lovers are in their attachments   they love all   and turn\\nblemishes into beauties   the snub  nosed youth is said to have a winning\\ngrace   the beak of another has a royal look   the featureless are\\nfaultless   the dark are manly   the fair angels   the sickly have a new\\nterm of endearment invented expressly for them   which is   honey  pale    \\nlovers of wine and lovers of ambition also desire the objects of their\\naffection in every form   now here comes the point  —the philosopher too\\nis a lover of knowledge in every form   he has an insatiable curiosity  \\n  but will curiosity make a philosopher   are the lovers of sights and\\nsounds   who let out their ears to every chorus at the dionysiac\\nfestivals   to be called philosophers     they are not true philosophers  \\nbut only an imitation     then how are we to describe the true    \\n\\nyou would acknowledge the existence of abstract ideas   such as justice  \\nbeauty   good   evil   which are severally one   yet in their various\\ncombinations appear to be many   those who recognize these realities are\\nphilosophers   whereas the other class hear sounds and see colours   and\\nunderstand their use in the arts   but cannot attain to the true or\\nwaking vision of absolute justice or beauty or truth   they have not the\\nlight of knowledge   but of opinion   and what they see is a dream only  \\nperhaps he of whom we say the last will be angry with us   can we pacify\\nhim without revealing the disorder of his mind   suppose we say that   if\\nhe has knowledge we rejoice to hear it   but knowledge must be of\\nsomething which is   as ignorance is of something which is not   and\\nthere is a third thing   which both is and is not   and is matter of\\nopinion only   opinion and knowledge   then   having distinct objects  \\nmust also be distinct faculties   and by faculties i mean powers unseen\\nand distinguishable only by the difference in their objects   as opinion\\nand knowledge differ   since the one is liable to err   but the other is\\nunerring and is the mightiest of all our faculties   if being is the\\nobject of knowledge   and not  being of ignorance   and these are the\\nextremes   opinion must lie between them   and may be called darker than\\nthe one and brighter than the other   this intermediate or contingent\\nmatter is and is not at the same time   and partakes both of existence\\nand of non  existence   now i would ask my good friend   who denies\\nabstract beauty and justice   and affirms a many beautiful and a many\\njust   whether everything he sees is not in some point of view\\ndifferent—the beautiful ugly   the pious impious   the just unjust   is\\nnot the double also the half   and are not heavy and light relative\\nterms which pass into one another   everything is and is not   as in the\\nold riddle—  a man and not a man shot and did not shoot a bird and not a\\nbird with a stone and not a stone     the mind cannot be fixed on either\\nalternative   and these ambiguous   intermediate   erring   half  lighted\\nobjects   which have a disorderly movement in the region between being\\nand not  being   are the proper matter of opinion   as the immutable\\nobjects are the proper matter of knowledge   and he who grovels in the\\nworld of sense   and has only this uncertain perception of things   is\\nnot a philosopher   but a lover of opinion only      \\n\\nthe fifth book is the new beginning of the republic   in which the\\ncommunity of property and of family are first maintained   and the\\ntransition is made to the kingdom of philosophers   for both of these\\nplato   after his manner   has been preparing in some chance words of\\nbook iv   which fall unperceived on the reader  s mind   as they are\\nsupposed at first to have fallen on the ear of glaucon and adeimantus  \\nthe   paradoxes     as morgenstern terms them   of this book of the\\nrepublic will be reserved for another place   a few remarks on the\\nstyle   and some explanations of difficulties   may be briefly added  \\n\\nfirst   there is the image of the waves   which serves for a sort of\\nscheme or plan of the book   the first wave   the second wave   the third\\nand greatest wave come rolling in   and we hear the roar of them   all\\nthat can be said of the extravagance of plato  s proposals is\\nanticipated by himself   nothing is more admirable than the hesitation\\nwith which he proposes the solemn text     until kings are philosophers    \\netc     or the reaction from the sublime to the ridiculous   when glaucon\\ndescribes the manner in which the new truth will be received by\\nmankind  \\n\\nsome defects and difficulties may be noted in the execution of the\\ncommunistic plan   nothing is told us of the application of communism to\\nthe lower classes   nor is the table of prohibited degrees capable of\\nbeing made out   it is quite possible that a child born at one hymeneal\\nfestival may marry one of its own brothers or sisters   or even one of\\nits parents   at another   plato is afraid of incestuous unions   but at\\nthe same time he does not wish to bring before us the fact that the\\ncity would be divided into families of those born seven and nine months\\nafter each hymeneal festival   if it were worth while to argue seriously\\nabout such fancies   we might remark that while all the old affinities\\nare abolished   the newly prohibited affinity rests not on any natural\\nor rational principle   but only upon the accident of children having\\nbeen born in the same month and year   nor does he explain how the lots\\ncould be so manipulated by the legislature as to bring together the\\nfairest and best   the singular expression which is employed to describe\\nthe age of five  and  twenty may perhaps be taken from some poet  \\n\\nin the delineation of the philosopher   the illustrations of the nature\\nof philosophy derived from love are more suited to the apprehension of\\nglaucon   the athenian man of pleasure   than to modern tastes or\\nfeelings   they are partly facetious   but also contain a germ of truth  \\nthat science is a whole   remains a true principle of inductive as well\\nas of metaphysical philosophy   and the love of universal knowledge is\\nstill the characteristic of the philosopher in modern as well as in\\nancient times  \\n\\nat the end of the fifth book plato introduces the figment of contingent\\nmatter   which has exercised so great an influence both on the ethics\\nand theology of the modern world   and which occurs here for the first\\ntime in the history of philosophy   he did not remark that the degrees\\nof knowledge in the subject have nothing corresponding to them in the\\nobject   with him a word must answer to an idea   and he could not\\nconceive of an opinion which was an opinion about nothing   the\\ninfluence of analogy led him to invent   parallels and conjugates   and\\nto overlook facts   to us some of his difficulties are puzzling only\\nfrom their simplicity   we do not perceive that the answer to them   is\\ntumbling out at our feet     to the mind of early thinkers   the\\nconception of not  being was dark and mysterious   they did not see that\\nthis terrible apparition which threatened destruction to all knowledge\\nwas only a logical determination   the common term under which   through\\nthe accidental use of language   two entirely different ideas were\\nincluded was another source of confusion   thus through the ambiguity of\\n  greek   plato   attempting to introduce order into the first chaos of\\nhuman thought   seems to have confused perception and opinion   and to\\nhave failed to distinguish the contingent from the relative   in the\\ntheaetetus the first of these difficulties begins to clear up   in the\\nsophist the second   and for this   as well as for other reasons   both\\nthese dialogues are probably to be regarded as later than the republic  \\n\\nbook vi   having determined that the many have no knowledge of true\\nbeing   and have no clear patterns in their minds of justice   beauty  \\ntruth   and that philosophers have such patterns   we have now to ask\\nwhether they or the many shall be rulers in our state   but who can\\ndoubt that philosophers should be chosen   if they have the other\\nqualities which are required in a ruler   for they are lovers of the\\nknowledge of the eternal and of all truth   they are haters of\\nfalsehood   their meaner desires are absorbed in the interests of\\nknowledge   they are spectators of all time and all existence   and in\\nthe magnificence of their contemplation the life of man is as nothing\\nto them   nor is death fearful   also they are of a social   gracious\\ndisposition   equally free from cowardice and arrogance   they learn and\\nremember easily   they have harmonious   well  regulated minds   truth\\nflows to them sweetly by nature   can the god of jealousy himself find\\nany fault with such an assemblage of good qualities  \\n\\nhere adeimantus interposes  —  no man can answer you   socrates   but every\\nman feels that this is owing to his own deficiency in argument   he is\\ndriven from one position to another   until he has nothing more to say  \\njust as an unskilful player at draughts is reduced to his last move by\\na more skilled opponent   and yet all the time he may be right   he may\\nknow   in this very instance   that those who make philosophy the\\nbusiness of their lives   generally turn out rogues if they are bad men  \\nand fools if they are good   what do you say     i should say that he is\\nquite right     then how is such an admission reconcileable with the\\ndoctrine that philosophers should be kings    \\n\\ni shall answer you in a parable which will also let you see how poor a\\nhand i am at the invention of allegories   the relation of good men to\\ntheir governments is so peculiar   that in order to defend them i must\\ntake an illustration from the world of fiction   conceive the captain of\\na ship   taller by a head and shoulders than any of the crew   yet a\\nlittle deaf   a little blind   and rather ignorant of the seaman  s art  \\nthe sailors want to steer   although they know nothing of the art   and\\nthey have a theory that it cannot be learned   if the helm is refused\\nthem   they drug the captain  s posset   bind him hand and foot   and take\\npossession of the ship   he who joins in the mutiny is termed a good\\npilot and what not   they have no conception that the true pilot must\\nobserve the winds and the stars   and must be their master   whether they\\nlike it or not  —such an one would be called by them fool   prater  \\nstar  gazer   this is my parable   which i will beg you to interpret for\\nme to those gentlemen who ask why the philosopher has such an evil\\nname   and to explain to them that not he   but those who will not use\\nhim   are to blame for his uselessness   the philosopher should not beg\\nof mankind to be put in authority over them   the wise man should not\\nseek the rich   as the proverb bids   but every man   whether rich or\\npoor   must knock at the door of the physician when he has need of him  \\nnow the pilot is the philosopher—he whom in the parable they call\\nstar  gazer   and the mutinous sailors are the mob of politicians by whom\\nhe is rendered useless   not that these are the worst enemies of\\nphilosophy   who is far more dishonoured by her own professing sons when\\nthey are corrupted by the world   need i recall the original image of\\nthe philosopher   did we not say of him just now   that he loved truth\\nand hated falsehood   and that he could not rest in the multiplicity of\\nphenomena   but was led by a sympathy in his own nature to the\\ncontemplation of the absolute   all the virtues as well as truth   who is\\nthe leader of them   took up their abode in his soul   but as you were\\nobserving   if we turn aside to view the reality   we see that the\\npersons who were thus described   with the exception of a small and\\nuseless class   are utter rogues  \\n\\nthe point which has to be considered   is the origin of this corruption\\nin nature   every one will admit that the philosopher   in our\\ndescription of him   is a rare being   but what numberless causes tend to\\ndestroy these rare beings   there is no good thing which may not be a\\ncause of evil—health   wealth   strength   rank   and the virtues\\nthemselves   when placed under unfavourable circumstances   for as in the\\nanimal or vegetable world the strongest seeds most need the\\naccompaniment of good air and soil   so the best of human characters\\nturn out the worst when they fall upon an unsuitable soil   whereas weak\\nnatures hardly ever do any considerable good or harm   they are not the\\nstuff out of which either great criminals or great heroes are made   the\\nphilosopher follows the same analogy   he is either the best or the\\nworst of all men   some persons say that the sophists are the corrupters\\nof youth   but is not public opinion the real sophist who is everywhere\\npresent—in those very persons   in the assembly   in the courts   in the\\ncamp   in the applauses and hisses of the theatre re  echoed by the\\nsurrounding hills   will not a young man  s heart leap amid these\\ndiscordant sounds   and will any education save him from being carried\\naway by the torrent   nor is this all   for if he will not yield to\\nopinion   there follows the gentle compulsion of exile or death   what\\nprinciple of rival sophists or anybody else can overcome in such an\\nunequal contest   characters there may be more than human   who are\\nexceptions—god may save a man   but not his own strength   further   i\\nwould have you consider that the hireling sophist only gives back to\\nthe world their own opinions   he is the keeper of the monster   who\\nknows how to flatter or anger him   and observes the meaning of his\\ninarticulate grunts   good is what pleases him   evil what he dislikes  \\ntruth and beauty are determined only by the taste of the brute   such is\\nthe sophist  s wisdom   and such is the condition of those who make\\npublic opinion the test of truth   whether in art or in morals   the\\ncurse is laid upon them of being and doing what it approves   and when\\nthey attempt first principles the failure is ludicrous   think of all\\nthis and ask yourself whether the world is more likely to be a believer\\nin the unity of the idea   or in the multiplicity of phenomena   and the\\nworld if not a believer in the idea cannot be a philosopher   and must\\ntherefore be a persecutor of philosophers   there is another evil  —the\\nworld does not like to lose the gifted nature   and so they flatter the\\nyoung   alcibiades   into a magnificent opinion of his own capacity   the\\ntall   proper youth begins to expand   and is dreaming of kingdoms and\\nempires   if at this instant a friend whispers to him     now the gods\\nlighten thee   thou art a great fool   and must be educated—do you think\\nthat he will listen   or suppose a better sort of man who is attracted\\ntowards philosophy   will they not make herculean efforts to spoil and\\ncorrupt him   are we not right in saying that the love of knowledge   no\\nless than riches   may divert him   men of this class   critias   often\\nbecome politicians—they are the authors of great mischief in states  \\nand sometimes also of great good   and thus philosophy is deserted by\\nher natural protectors   and others enter in and dishonour her   vulgar\\nlittle minds see the land open and rush from the prisons of the arts\\ninto her temple   a clever mechanic having a soul coarse as his body  \\nthinks that he will gain caste by becoming her suitor   for philosophy  \\neven in her fallen estate   has a dignity of her own—and he   like a bald\\nlittle blacksmith  s apprentice as he is   having made some money and got\\nout of durance   washes and dresses himself as a bridegroom and marries\\nhis master  s daughter   what will be the issue of such marriages   will\\nthey not be vile and bastard   devoid of truth and nature     they will    \\nsmall   then   is the remnant of genuine philosophers   there may be a few\\nwho are citizens of small states   in which politics are not worth\\nthinking of   or who have been detained by theages   bridle of ill\\nhealth   for my own case of the oracular sign is almost unique   and too\\nrare to be worth mentioning   and these few when they have tasted the\\npleasures of philosophy   and have taken a look at that den of thieves\\nand place of wild beasts   which is human life   will stand aside from\\nthe storm under the shelter of a wall   and try to preserve their own\\ninnocence and to depart in peace     a great work   too   will have been\\naccomplished by them     great   yes   but not the greatest   for man is a\\nsocial being   and can only attain his highest development in the\\nsociety which is best suited to him  \\n\\nenough   then   of the causes why philosophy has such an evil name  \\nanother question is   which of existing states is suited to her   not one\\nof them   at present she is like some exotic seed which degenerates in a\\nstrange soil   only in her proper state will she be shown to be of\\nheavenly growth     and is her proper state ours or some other     ours in\\nall points but one   which was left undetermined   you may remember our\\nsaying that some living mind or witness of the legislator was needed in\\nstates   but we were afraid to enter upon a subject of such difficulty  \\nand now the question recurs and has not grown easier  —how may\\nphilosophy be safely studied   let us bring her into the light of day  \\nand make an end of the inquiry  \\n\\nin the first place   i say boldly that nothing can be worse than the\\npresent mode of study   persons usually pick up a little philosophy in\\nearly youth   and in the intervals of business   but they never master\\nthe real difficulty   which is dialectic   later   perhaps   they\\noccasionally go to a lecture on philosophy   years advance   and the sun\\nof philosophy   unlike that of heracleitus   sets never to rise again  \\nthis order of education should be reversed   it should begin with\\ngymnastics in youth   and as the man strengthens   he should increase the\\ngymnastics of his soul   then   when active life is over   let him finally\\nreturn to philosophy     you are in earnest   socrates   but the world will\\nbe equally earnest in withstanding you—no more than thrasymachus     do\\nnot make a quarrel between thrasymachus and me   who were never enemies\\nand are now good friends enough   and i shall do my best to convince him\\nand all mankind of the truth of my words   or at any rate to prepare for\\nthe future when   in another life   we may again take part in similar\\ndiscussions     that will be a long time hence     not long in comparison\\nwith eternity   the many will probably remain incredulous   for they have\\nnever seen the natural unity of ideas   but only artificial\\njuxtapositions   not free and generous thoughts   but tricks of\\ncontroversy and quips of law  —a perfect man ruling in a perfect state  \\neven a single one they have not known   and we foresaw that there was no\\nchance of perfection either in states or individuals until a necessity\\nwas laid upon philosophers—not the rogues   but those whom we called the\\nuseless class—of holding office   or until the sons of kings were\\ninspired with a true love of philosophy   whether in the infinity of\\npast time there has been   or is in some distant land   or ever will be\\nhereafter   an ideal such as we have described   we stoutly maintain that\\nthere has been   is   and will be such a state whenever the muse of\\nphilosophy rules   will you say that the world is of another mind   o   my\\nfriend   do not revile the world   they will soon change their opinion if\\nthey are gently entreated   and are taught the true nature of the\\nphilosopher   who can hate a man who loves him   or be jealous of one who\\nhas no jealousy   consider   again   that the many hate not the true but\\nthe false philosophers—the pretenders who force their way in without\\ninvitation   and are always speaking of persons and not of principles  \\nwhich is unlike the spirit of philosophy   for the true philosopher\\ndespises earthly strife   his eye is fixed on the eternal order in\\naccordance with which he moulds himself into the divine image   and not\\nhimself only   but other men     and is the creator of the virtues private\\nas well as public   when mankind see that the happiness of states is\\nonly to be found in that image   will they be angry with us for\\nattempting to delineate it     certainly not   but what will be the\\nprocess of delineation     the artist will do nothing until he has made a\\ntabula rasa   on this he will inscribe the constitution of a state  \\nglancing often at the divine truth of nature   and from that deriving\\nthe godlike among men   mingling the two elements   rubbing out and\\npainting in   until there is a perfect harmony or fusion of the divine\\nand human   but perhaps the world will doubt the existence of such an\\nartist   what will they doubt   that the philosopher is a lover of truth  \\nhaving a nature akin to the best  —and if they admit this will they\\nstill quarrel with us for making philosophers our kings     they will be\\nless disposed to quarrel     let us assume then that they are pacified  \\nstill   a person may hesitate about the probability of the son of a king\\nbeing a philosopher   and we do not deny that they are very liable to be\\ncorrupted   but yet surely in the course of ages there might be one\\nexception—and one is enough   if one son of a king were a philosopher  \\nand had obedient citizens   he might bring the ideal polity into being  \\nhence we conclude that our laws are not only the best   but that they\\nare also possible   though not free from difficulty  \\n\\ni gained nothing by evading the troublesome questions which arose\\nconcerning women and children   i will be wiser now and acknowledge that\\nwe must go to the bottom of another question   what is to be the\\neducation of our guardians   it was agreed that they were to be lovers\\nof their country   and were to be tested in the refiner  s fire of\\npleasures and pains   and those who came forth pure and remained fixed\\nin their principles were to have honours and rewards in life and after\\ndeath   but at this point   the argument put on her veil and turned into\\nanother path   i hesitated to make the assertion which i now\\nhazard  —that our guardians must be philosophers   you remember all the\\ncontradictory elements   which met in the philosopher—how difficult to\\nfind them all in a single person   intelligence and spirit are not often\\ncombined with steadiness   the stolid   fearless   nature is averse to\\nintellectual toil   and yet these opposite elements are all necessary  \\nand therefore   as we were saying before   the aspirant must be tested in\\npleasures and dangers   and also   as we must now further add   in the\\nhighest branches of knowledge   you will remember   that when we spoke of\\nthe virtues mention was made of a longer road   which you were satisfied\\nto leave unexplored     enough seemed to have been said     enough   my\\nfriend   but what is enough while anything remains wanting   of all men\\nthe guardian must not faint in the search after truth   he must be\\nprepared to take the longer road   or he will never reach that higher\\nregion which is above the four virtues   and of the virtues too he must\\nnot only get an outline   but a clear and distinct vision     strange that\\nwe should be so precise about trifles   so careless about the highest\\ntruths       and what are the highest     you to pretend unconsciousness  \\nwhen you have so often heard me speak of the idea of good   about which\\nwe know so little   and without which though a man gain the world he has\\nno profit of it   some people imagine that the good is wisdom   but this\\ninvolves a circle  —the good   they say   is wisdom   wisdom has to do with\\nthe good   according to others the good is pleasure   but then comes the\\nabsurdity that good is bad   for there are bad pleasures as well as\\ngood   again   the good must have reality   a man may desire the\\nappearance of virtue   but he will not desire the appearance of good  \\nought our guardians then to be ignorant of this supreme principle   of\\nwhich every man has a presentiment   and without which no man has any\\nreal knowledge of anything     but   socrates   what is this supreme\\nprinciple   knowledge or pleasure   or what   you may think me\\ntroublesome   but i say that you have no business to be always repeating\\nthe doctrines of others instead of giving us your own     can i say what\\ni do not know     you may offer an opinion     and will the blindness and\\ncrookedness of opinion content you when you might have the light and\\ncertainty of science     i will only ask you to give such an explanation\\nof the good as you have given already of temperance and justice     i\\nwish that i could   but in my present mood i cannot reach to the height\\nof the knowledge of the good   to the parent or principal i cannot\\nintroduce you   but to the child begotten in his image   which i may\\ncompare with the interest on the principal   i will     audit the account  \\nand do not let me give you a false statement of the debt     you remember\\nour old distinction of the many beautiful and the one beautiful   the\\nparticular and the universal   the objects of sight and the objects of\\nthought   did you ever consider that the objects of sight imply a\\nfaculty of sight which is the most complex and costly of our senses  \\nrequiring not only objects of sense   but also a medium   which is light  \\nwithout which the sight will not distinguish between colours and all\\nwill be a blank   for light is the noble bond between the perceiving\\nfaculty and the thing perceived   and the god who gives us light is the\\nsun   who is the eye of the day   but is not to be confounded with the\\neye of man   this eye of the day or sun is what i call the child of the\\ngood   standing in the same relation to the visible world as the good to\\nthe intellectual   when the sun shines the eye sees   and in the\\nintellectual world where truth is   there is sight and light   now that\\nwhich is the sun of intelligent natures   is the idea of good   the cause\\nof knowledge and truth   yet other and fairer than they are   and\\nstanding in the same relation to them in which the sun stands to light  \\no inconceivable height of beauty   which is above knowledge and above\\ntruth       you cannot surely mean pleasure     he said   peace   i replied    \\nand this idea of good   like the sun   is also the cause of growth   and\\nthe author not of knowledge only   but of being   yet greater far than\\neither in dignity and power     that is a reach of thought more than\\nhuman   but   pray   go on with the image   for i suspect that there is\\nmore behind     there is   i said   and bearing in mind our two suns or\\nprinciples   imagine further their corresponding worlds—one of the\\nvisible   the other of the intelligible   you may assist your fancy by\\nfiguring the distinction under the image of a line divided into two\\nunequal parts   and may again subdivide each part into two lesser\\nsegments representative of the stages of knowledge in either sphere  \\nthe lower portion of the lower or visible sphere will consist of\\nshadows and reflections   and its upper and smaller portion will contain\\nreal objects in the world of nature or of art   the sphere of the\\nintelligible will also have two divisions  —one of mathematics   in which\\nthere is no ascent but all is descent   no inquiring into premises   but\\nonly drawing of inferences   in this division the mind works with\\nfigures and numbers   the images of which are taken not from the\\nshadows   but from the objects   although the truth of them is seen only\\nwith the mind  s eye   and they are used as hypotheses without being\\nanalysed   whereas in the other division reason uses the hypotheses as\\nstages or steps in the ascent to the idea of good   to which she fastens\\nthem   and then again descends   walking firmly in the region of ideas  \\nand of ideas only   in her ascent as well as descent   and finally\\nresting in them     i partly understand     he replied     you mean that the\\nideas of science are superior to the hypothetical   metaphorical\\nconceptions of geometry and the other arts or sciences   whichever is to\\nbe the name of them   and the latter conceptions you refuse to make\\nsubjects of pure intellect   because they have no first principle  \\nalthough when resting on a first principle   they pass into the higher\\nsphere     you understand me very well   i said   and now to those four\\ndivisions of knowledge you may assign four corresponding faculties—pure\\nintelligence to the highest sphere   active intelligence to the second  \\nto the third   faith   to the fourth   the perception of shadows—and the\\nclearness of the several faculties will be in the same ratio as the\\ntruth of the objects to which they are related      \\n\\nlike socrates   we may recapitulate the virtues of the philosopher   in\\nlanguage which seems to reach beyond the horizon of that age and\\ncountry   he is described as   the spectator of all time and all\\nexistence     he has the noblest gifts of nature   and makes the highest\\nuse of them   all his desires are absorbed in the love of wisdom   which\\nis the love of truth   none of the graces of a beautiful soul are\\nwanting in him   neither can he fear death   or think much of human life  \\nthe ideal of modern times hardly retains the simplicity of the antique  \\nthere is not the same originality either in truth or error which\\ncharacterized the greeks   the philosopher is no longer living in the\\nunseen   nor is he sent by an oracle to convince mankind of ignorance  \\nnor does he regard knowledge as a system of ideas leading upwards by\\nregular stages to the idea of good   the eagerness of the pursuit has\\nabated   there is more division of labour and less of comprehensive\\nreflection upon nature and human life as a whole   more of exact\\nobservation and less of anticipation and inspiration   still   in the\\naltered conditions of knowledge   the parallel is not wholly lost   and\\nthere may be a use in translating the conception of plato into the\\nlanguage of our own age   the philosopher in modern times is one who\\nfixes his mind on the laws of nature in their sequence and connexion  \\nnot on fragments or pictures of nature   on history   not on controversy  \\non the truths which are acknowledged by the few   not on the opinions of\\nthe many   he is aware of the importance of   classifying according to\\nnature     and will try to   separate the limbs of science without\\nbreaking them     phaedr       there is no part of truth   whether great or\\nsmall   which he will dishonour   and in the least things he will discern\\nthe greatest   parmen       like the ancient philosopher he sees the world\\npervaded by analogies   but he can also tell   why in some cases a single\\ninstance is sufficient for an induction     mill  s logic     while in other\\ncases a thousand examples would prove nothing   he inquires into a\\nportion of knowledge only   because the whole has grown too vast to be\\nembraced by a single mind or life   he has a clearer conception of the\\ndivisions of science and of their relation to the mind of man than was\\npossible to the ancients   like plato   he has a vision of the unity of\\nknowledge   not as the beginning of philosophy to be attained by a study\\nof elementary mathematics   but as the far  off result of the working of\\nmany minds in many ages   he is aware that mathematical studies are\\npreliminary to almost every other   at the same time   he will not reduce\\nall varieties of knowledge to the type of mathematics   he too must have\\na nobility of character   without which genius loses the better half of\\ngreatness   regarding the world as a point in immensity   and each\\nindividual as a link in a never  ending chain of existence   he will not\\nthink much of his own life   or be greatly afraid of death  \\n\\nadeimantus objects first of all to the form of the socratic reasoning  \\nthus showing that plato is aware of the imperfection of his own method  \\nhe brings the accusation against himself which might be brought against\\nhim by a modern logician—that he extracts the answer because he knows\\nhow to put the question   in a long argument words are apt to change\\ntheir meaning slightly   or premises may be assumed or conclusions\\ninferred with rather too much certainty or universality   the variation\\nat each step may be unobserved   and yet at last the divergence becomes\\nconsiderable   hence the failure of attempts to apply arithmetical or\\nalgebraic formulae to logic   the imperfection   or rather the higher and\\nmore elastic nature of language   does not allow words to have the\\nprecision of numbers or of symbols   and this quality in language\\nimpairs the force of an argument which has many steps  \\n\\nthe objection   though fairly met by socrates in this particular\\ninstance   may be regarded as implying a reflection upon the socratic\\nmode of reasoning   and here   as elsewhere   plato seems to intimate that\\nthe time had come when the negative and interrogative method of\\nsocrates must be superseded by a positive and constructive one   of\\nwhich examples are given in some of the later dialogues   adeimantus\\nfurther argues that the ideal is wholly at variance with facts   for\\nexperience proves philosophers to be either useless or rogues   contrary\\nto all expectation socrates has no hesitation in admitting the truth of\\nthis   and explains the anomaly in an allegory   first characteristically\\ndepreciating his own inventive powers   in this allegory the people are\\ndistinguished from the professional politicians   and   as elsewhere   are\\nspoken of in a tone of pity rather than of censure under the image of\\n  the noble captain who is not very quick in his perceptions    \\n\\nthe uselessness of philosophers is explained by the circumstance that\\nmankind will not use them   the world in all ages has been divided\\nbetween contempt and fear of those who employ the power of ideas and\\nknow no other weapons   concerning the false philosopher   socrates\\nargues that the best is most liable to corruption   and that the finer\\nnature is more likely to suffer from alien conditions   we too observe\\nthat there are some kinds of excellence which spring from a peculiar\\ndelicacy of constitution   as is evidently true of the poetical and\\nimaginative temperament   which often seems to depend on impressions  \\nand hence can only breathe or live in a certain atmosphere   the man of\\ngenius has greater pains and greater pleasures   greater powers and\\ngreater weaknesses   and often a greater play of character than is to be\\nfound in ordinary men   he can assume the disguise of virtue or\\ndisinterestedness without having them   or veil personal enmity in the\\nlanguage of patriotism and philosophy  —he can say the word which all\\nmen are thinking   he has an insight which is terrible into the follies\\nand weaknesses of his fellow  men   an alcibiades   a mirabeau   or a\\nnapoleon the first   are born either to be the authors of great evils in\\nstates   or   of great good   when they are drawn in that direction    \\n\\nyet the thesis     corruptio optimi pessima     cannot be maintained\\ngenerally or without regard to the kind of excellence which is\\ncorrupted   the alien conditions which are corrupting to one nature   may\\nbe the elements of culture to another   in general a man can only\\nreceive his highest development in a congenial state or family   among\\nfriends or fellow  workers   but also he may sometimes be stirred by\\nadverse circumstances to such a degree that he rises up against them\\nand reforms them   and while weaker or coarser characters will extract\\ngood out of evil   say in a corrupt state of the church or of society  \\nand live on happily   allowing the evil to remain   the finer or stronger\\nnatures may be crushed or spoiled by surrounding influences—may become\\nmisanthrope and philanthrope by turns   or in a few instances   like the\\nfounders of the monastic orders   or the reformers   owing to some\\npeculiarity in themselves or in their age   may break away entirely from\\nthe world and from the church   sometimes into great good   sometimes\\ninto great evil   sometimes into both   and the same holds in the lesser\\nsphere of a convent   a school   a family  \\n\\nplato would have us consider how easily the best natures are\\noverpowered by public opinion   and what efforts the rest of mankind\\nwill make to get possession of them   the world   the church   their own\\nprofession   any political or party organization   are always carrying\\nthem off their legs and teaching them to apply high and holy names to\\ntheir own prejudices and interests   the   monster   corporation to which\\nthey belong judges right and truth to be the pleasure of the community  \\nthe individual becomes one with his order   or   if he resists   the world\\nis too much for him   and will sooner or later be revenged on him   this\\nis   perhaps   a one  sided but not wholly untrue picture of the maxims\\nand practice of mankind when they   sit down together at an assembly    \\neither in ancient or modern times  \\n\\nwhen the higher natures are corrupted by politics   the lower take\\npossession of the vacant place of philosophy   this is described in one\\nof those continuous images in which the argument   to use a platonic\\nexpression     veils herself     and which is dropped and reappears at\\nintervals   the question is asked  —why are the citizens of states so\\nhostile to philosophy   the answer is   that they do not know her   and\\nyet there is also a better mind of the many   they would believe if they\\nwere taught   but hitherto they have only known a conventional imitation\\nof philosophy   words without thoughts   systems which have no life in\\nthem   a   divine   person uttering the words of beauty and freedom   the\\nfriend of man holding communion with the eternal   and seeking to frame\\nthe state in that image   they have never known   the same double feeling\\nrespecting the mass of mankind has always existed among men   the first\\nthought is that the people are the enemies of truth and right   the\\nsecond   that this only arises out of an accidental error and confusion  \\nand that they do not really hate those who love them   if they could be\\neducated to know them  \\n\\nin the latter part of the sixth book   three questions have to be\\nconsidered   1st   the nature of the longer and more circuitous way  \\nwhich is contrasted with the shorter and more imperfect method of book\\niv   2nd   the heavenly pattern or idea of the state   3rd   the relation\\nof the divisions of knowledge to one another and to the corresponding\\nfaculties of the soul  \\n\\n1   of the higher method of knowledge in plato we have only a glimpse  \\nneither here nor in the phaedrus or symposium   nor yet in the philebus\\nor sophist   does he give any clear explanation of his meaning   he would\\nprobably have described his method as proceeding by regular steps to a\\nsystem of universal knowledge   which inferred the parts from the whole\\nrather than the whole from the parts   this ideal logic is not practised\\nby him in the search after justice   or in the analysis of the parts of\\nthe soul   there   like aristotle in the nicomachean ethics   he argues\\nfrom experience and the common use of language   but at the end of the\\nsixth book he conceives another and more perfect method   in which all\\nideas are only steps or grades or moments of thought   forming a\\nconnected whole which is self  supporting   and in which consistency is\\nthe test of truth   he does not explain to us in detail the nature of\\nthe process   like many other thinkers both in ancient and modern times\\nhis mind seems to be filled with a vacant form which he is unable to\\nrealize   he supposes the sciences to have a natural order and connexion\\nin an age when they can hardly be said to exist   he is hastening on to\\nthe   end of the intellectual world   without even making a beginning of\\nthem  \\n\\nin modern times we hardly need to be reminded that the process of\\nacquiring knowledge is here confused with the contemplation of absolute\\nknowledge   in all science a priori and a posteriori truths mingle in\\nvarious proportions   the a priori part is that which is derived from\\nthe most universal experience of men   or is universally accepted by\\nthem   the a posteriori is that which grows up around the more general\\nprinciples and becomes imperceptibly one with them   but plato\\nerroneously imagines that the synthesis is separable from the analysis  \\nand that the method of science can anticipate science   in entertaining\\nsuch a vision of a priori knowledge he is sufficiently justified   or at\\nleast his meaning may be sufficiently explained by the similar attempts\\nof descartes   kant   hegel   and even of bacon himself   in modern\\nphilosophy   anticipations or divinations   or prophetic glimpses of\\ntruths whether concerning man or nature   seem to stand in the same\\nrelation to ancient philosophy which hypotheses bear to modern\\ninductive science   these   guesses at truth   were not made at random  \\nthey arose from a superficial impression of uniformities and first\\nprinciples in nature which the genius of the greek   contemplating the\\nexpanse of heaven and earth   seemed to recognize in the distance   nor\\ncan we deny that in ancient times knowledge must have stood still   and\\nthe human mind been deprived of the very instruments of thought   if\\nphilosophy had been strictly confined to the results of experience  \\n\\n2   plato supposes that when the tablet has been made blank the artist\\nwill fill in the lineaments of the ideal state   is this a pattern laid\\nup in heaven   or mere vacancy on which he is supposed to gaze with\\nwondering eye   the answer is   that such ideals are framed partly by the\\nomission of particulars   partly by imagination perfecting the form\\nwhich experience supplies   phaedo     plato represents these ideals in a\\nfigure as belonging to another world   and in modern times the idea will\\nsometimes seem to precede   at other times to co  operate with the hand\\nof the artist   as in science   so also in creative art   there is a\\nsynthetical as well as an analytical method   one man will have the\\nwhole in his mind before he begins   to another the processes of mind\\nand hand will be simultaneous  \\n\\n3   there is no difficulty in seeing that plato  s divisions of knowledge\\nare based   first   on the fundamental antithesis of sensible and\\nintellectual which pervades the whole pre  socratic philosophy   in which\\nis implied also the opposition of the permanent and transient   of the\\nuniversal and particular   but the age of philosophy in which he lived\\nseemed to require a further distinction  —numbers and figures were\\nbeginning to separate from ideas   the world could no longer regard\\njustice as a cube   and was learning to see   though imperfectly   that\\nthe abstractions of sense were distinct from the abstractions of mind  \\nbetween the eleatic being or essence and the shadows of phenomena   the\\npythagorean principle of number found a place   and was   as aristotle\\nremarks   a conducting medium from one to the other   hence plato is led\\nto introduce a third term which had not hitherto entered into the\\nscheme of his philosophy   he had observed the use of mathematics in\\neducation   they were the best preparation for higher studies   the\\nsubjective relation between them further suggested an objective one  \\nalthough the passage from one to the other is really imaginary\\n  metaph       for metaphysical and moral philosophy has no connexion with\\nmathematics   number and figure are the abstractions of time and space  \\nnot the expressions of purely intellectual conceptions   when divested\\nof metaphor   a straight line or a square has no more to do with right\\nand justice than a crooked line with vice   the figurative association\\nwas mistaken for a real one   and thus the three latter divisions of the\\nplatonic proportion were constructed  \\n\\nthere is more difficulty in comprehending how he arrived at the first\\nterm of the series   which is nowhere else mentioned   and has no\\nreference to any other part of his system   nor indeed does the relation\\nof shadows to objects correspond to the relation of numbers to ideas  \\nprobably plato has been led by the love of analogy   timaeus   to make\\nfour terms instead of three   although the objects perceived in both\\ndivisions of the lower sphere are equally objects of sense   he is also\\npreparing the way   as his manner is   for the shadows of images at the\\nbeginning of the seventh book   and the imitation of an imitation in the\\ntenth   the line may be regarded as reaching from unity to infinity   and\\nis divided into two unequal parts   and subdivided into two more   each\\nlower sphere is the multiplication of the preceding   of the four\\nfaculties   faith in the lower division has an intermediate position\\n  cp   for the use of the word faith or belief     greek     timaeus    \\ncontrasting equally with the vagueness of the perception of shadows\\n  greek   and the higher certainty of understanding   greek   and reason\\n  greek    \\n\\nthe difference between understanding and mind or reason   greek   is\\nanalogous to the difference between acquiring knowledge in the parts\\nand the contemplation of the whole   true knowledge is a whole   and is\\nat rest   consistency and universality are the tests of truth   to this\\nself  evidencing knowledge of the whole the faculty of mind is supposed\\nto correspond   but there is a knowledge of the understanding which is\\nincomplete and in motion always   because unable to rest in the\\nsubordinate ideas   those ideas are called both images and\\nhypotheses—images because they are clothed in sense   hypotheses because\\nthey are assumptions only   until they are brought into connexion with\\nthe idea of good  \\n\\nthe general meaning of the passage     noble   then   is the bond which\\nlinks together sight      and of this kind i spoke as the intelligible        \\nso far as the thought contained in it admits of being translated into\\nthe terms of modern philosophy   may be described or explained as\\nfollows  —there is a truth   one and self  existent   to which by the help\\nof a ladder let down from above   the human intelligence may ascend  \\nthis unity is like the sun in the heavens   the light by which all\\nthings are seen   the being by which they are created and sustained   it\\nis the idea of good   and the steps of the ladder leading up to this\\nhighest or universal existence are the mathematical sciences   which\\nalso contain in themselves an element of the universal   these   too   we\\nsee in a new manner when we connect them with the idea of good   they\\nthen cease to be hypotheses or pictures   and become essential parts of\\na higher truth which is at once their first principle and their final\\ncause  \\n\\nwe cannot give any more precise meaning to this remarkable passage   but\\nwe may trace in it several rudiments or vestiges of thought which are\\ncommon to us and to plato   such as   1   the unity and correlation of the\\nsciences   or rather of science   for in plato  s time they were not yet\\nparted off or distinguished     2   the existence of a divine power   or\\nlife or idea or cause or reason   not yet conceived or no longer\\nconceived as in the timaeus and elsewhere under the form of a person  \\n  3   the recognition of the hypothetical and conditional character of\\nthe mathematical sciences   and in a measure of every science when\\nisolated from the rest     4   the conviction of a truth which is\\ninvisible   and of a law   though hardly a law of nature   which permeates\\nthe intellectual rather than the visible world  \\n\\nthe method of socrates is hesitating and tentative   awaiting the fuller\\nexplanation of the idea of good   and of the nature of dialectic in the\\nseventh book   the imperfect intelligence of glaucon   and the reluctance\\nof socrates to make a beginning   mark the difficulty of the subject  \\nthe allusion to theages   bridle   and to the internal oracle   or demonic\\nsign   of socrates   which here   as always in plato   is only prohibitory  \\nthe remark that the salvation of any remnant of good in the present\\nevil state of the world is due to god only   the reference to a future\\nstate of existence   which is unknown to glaucon in the tenth book   and\\nin which the discussions of socrates and his disciples would be\\nresumed   the surprise in the answers   the fanciful irony of socrates  \\nwhere he pretends that he can only describe the strange position of the\\nphilosopher in a figure of speech   the original observation that the\\nsophists   after all   are only the representatives and not the leaders\\nof public opinion   the picture of the philosopher standing aside in the\\nshower of sleet under a wall   the figure of   the great beast   followed\\nby the expression of good  will towards the common people who would not\\nhave rejected the philosopher if they had known him   the   right noble\\nthought   that the highest truths demand the greatest exactness   the\\nhesitation of socrates in returning once more to his well  worn theme of\\nthe idea of good   the ludicrous earnestness of glaucon   the comparison\\nof philosophy to a deserted maiden who marries beneath her—are some of\\nthe most interesting characteristics of the sixth book  \\n\\nyet a few more words may be added   on the old theme   which was so oft\\ndiscussed in the socratic circle   of which we   like glaucon and\\nadeimantus   would fain   if possible   have a clearer notion   like them  \\nwe are dissatisfied when we are told that the idea of good can only be\\nrevealed to a student of the mathematical sciences   and we are inclined\\nto think that neither we nor they could have been led along that path\\nto any satisfactory goal   for we have learned that differences of\\nquantity cannot pass into differences of quality   and that the\\nmathematical sciences can never rise above themselves into the sphere\\nof our higher thoughts   although they may sometimes furnish symbols and\\nexpressions of them   and may train the mind in habits of abstraction\\nand self  concentration   the illusion which was natural to an ancient\\nphilosopher has ceased to be an illusion to us   but if the process by\\nwhich we are supposed to arrive at the idea of good be really\\nimaginary   may not the idea itself be also a mere abstraction   we\\nremark   first   that in all ages   and especially in primitive\\nphilosophy   words such as being   essence   unity   good   have exerted an\\nextraordinary influence over the minds of men   the meagreness or\\nnegativeness of their content has been in an inverse ratio to their\\npower   they have become the forms under which all things were\\ncomprehended   there was a need or instinct in the human soul which they\\nsatisfied   they were not ideas   but gods   and to this new mythology the\\nmen of a later generation began to attach the powers and associations\\nof the elder deities  \\n\\nthe idea of good is one of those sacred words or forms of thought  \\nwhich were beginning to take the place of the old mythology   it meant\\nunity   in which all time and all existence were gathered up   it was the\\ntruth of all things   and also the light in which they shone forth   and\\nbecame evident to intelligences human and divine   it was the cause of\\nall things   the power by which they were brought into being   it was the\\nuniversal reason divested of a human personality   it was the life as\\nwell as the light of the world   all knowledge and all power were\\ncomprehended in it   the way to it was through the mathematical\\nsciences   and these too were dependent on it   to ask whether god was\\nthe maker of it   or made by it   would be like asking whether god could\\nbe conceived apart from goodness   or goodness apart from god   the god\\nof the timaeus is not really at variance with the idea of good   they\\nare aspects of the same   differing only as the personal from the\\nimpersonal   or the masculine from the neuter   the one being the\\nexpression or language of mythology   the other of philosophy  \\n\\nthis   or something like this   is the meaning of the idea of good as\\nconceived by plato   ideas of number   order   harmony   development may\\nalso be said to enter into it   the paraphrase which has just been given\\nof it goes beyond the actual words of plato   we have perhaps arrived at\\nthe stage of philosophy which enables us to understand what he is\\naiming at   better than he did himself   we are beginning to realize what\\nhe saw darkly and at a distance   but if he could have been told that\\nthis   or some conception of the same kind   but higher than this   was\\nthe truth at which he was aiming   and the need which he sought to\\nsupply   he would gladly have recognized that more was contained in his\\nown thoughts than he himself knew   as his words are few and his manner\\nreticent and tentative   so must the style of his interpreter be   we\\nshould not approach his meaning more nearly by attempting to define it\\nfurther   in translating him into the language of modern thought   we\\nmight insensibly lose the spirit of ancient philosophy   it is\\nremarkable that although plato speaks of the idea of good as the first\\nprinciple of truth and being   it is nowhere mentioned in his writings\\nexcept in this passage   nor did it retain any hold upon the minds of\\nhis disciples in a later generation   it was probably unintelligible to\\nthem   nor does the mention of it in aristotle appear to have any\\nreference to this or any other passage in his extant writings  \\n\\nbook vii   and now i will describe in a figure the enlightenment or\\nunenlightenment of our nature  —imagine human beings living in an\\nunderground den which is open towards the light   they have been there\\nfrom childhood   having their necks and legs chained   and can only see\\ninto the den   at a distance there is a fire   and between the fire and\\nthe prisoners a raised way   and a low wall is built along the way   like\\nthe screen over which marionette players show their puppets   behind the\\nwall appear moving figures   who hold in their hands various works of\\nart   and among them images of men and animals   wood and stone   and some\\nof the passers  by are talking and others silent     a strange parable    \\nhe said     and strange captives     they are ourselves   i replied   and\\nthey see only the shadows of the images which the fire throws on the\\nwall of the den   to these they give names   and if we add an echo which\\nreturns from the wall   the voices of the passengers will seem to\\nproceed from the shadows   suppose now that you suddenly turn them round\\nand make them look with pain and grief to themselves at the real\\nimages   will they believe them to be real   will not their eyes be\\ndazzled   and will they not try to get away from the light to something\\nwhich they are able to behold without blinking   and suppose further  \\nthat they are dragged up a steep and rugged ascent into the presence of\\nthe sun himself   will not their sight be darkened with the excess of\\nlight   some time will pass before they get the habit of perceiving at\\nall   and at first they will be able to perceive only shadows and\\nreflections in the water   then they will recognize the moon and the\\nstars   and will at length behold the sun in his own proper place as he\\nis   last of all they will conclude  —this is he who gives us the year\\nand the seasons   and is the author of all that we see   how will they\\nrejoice in passing from darkness to light   how worthless to them will\\nseem the honours and glories of the den   but now imagine further   that\\nthey descend into their old habitations  —in that underground dwelling\\nthey will not see as well as their fellows   and will not be able to\\ncompete with them in the measurement of the shadows on the wall   there\\nwill be many jokes about the man who went on a visit to the sun and\\nlost his eyes   and if they find anybody trying to set free and\\nenlighten one of their number   they will put him to death   if they can\\ncatch him   now the cave or den is the world of sight   the fire is the\\nsun   the way upwards is the way to knowledge   and in the world of\\nknowledge the idea of good is last seen and with difficulty   but when\\nseen is inferred to be the author of good and right—parent of the lord\\nof light in this world   and of truth and understanding in the other   he\\nwho attains to the beatific vision is always going upwards   he is\\nunwilling to descend into political assemblies and courts of law   for\\nhis eyes are apt to blink at the images or shadows of images which they\\nbehold in them—he cannot enter into the ideas of those who have never\\nin their lives understood the relation of the shadow to the substance  \\nbut blindness is of two kinds   and may be caused either by passing out\\nof darkness into light or out of light into darkness   and a man of\\nsense will distinguish between them   and will not laugh equally at both\\nof them   but the blindness which arises from fulness of light he will\\ndeem blessed   and pity the other   or if he laugh at the puzzled soul\\nlooking at the sun   he will have more reason to laugh than the\\ninhabitants of the den at those who descend from above   there is a\\nfurther lesson taught by this parable of ours   some persons fancy that\\ninstruction is like giving eyes to the blind   but we say that the\\nfaculty of sight was always there   and that the soul only requires to\\nbe turned round towards the light   and this is conversion   other\\nvirtues are almost like bodily habits   and may be acquired in the same\\nmanner   but intelligence has a diviner life   and is indestructible  \\nturning either to good or evil according to the direction given   did\\nyou never observe how the mind of a clever rogue peers out of his eyes  \\nand the more clearly he sees   the more evil he does   now if you take\\nsuch an one   and cut away from him those leaden weights of pleasure and\\ndesire which bind his soul to earth   his intelligence will be turned\\nround   and he will behold the truth as clearly as he now discerns his\\nmeaner ends   and have we not decided that our rulers must neither be so\\nuneducated as to have no fixed rule of life   nor so over  educated as to\\nbe unwilling to leave their paradise for the business of the world   we\\nmust choose out therefore the natures who are most likely to ascend to\\nthe light and knowledge of the good   but we must not allow them to\\nremain in the region of light   they must be forced down again among the\\ncaptives in the den to partake of their labours and honours     will they\\nnot think this a hardship     you should remember that our purpose in\\nframing the state was not that our citizens should do what they like  \\nbut that they should serve the state for the common good of all   may we\\nnot fairly say to our philosopher  —friend   we do you no wrong   for in\\nother states philosophy grows wild   and a wild plant owes nothing to\\nthe gardener   but you have been trained by us to be the rulers and\\nkings of our hive   and therefore we must insist on your descending into\\nthe den   you must   each of you   take your turn   and become able to use\\nyour eyes in the dark   and with a little practice you will see far\\nbetter than those who quarrel about the shadows   whose knowledge is a\\ndream only   whilst yours is a waking reality   it may be that the saint\\nor philosopher who is best fitted   may also be the least inclined to\\nrule   but necessity is laid upon him   and he must no longer live in the\\nheaven of ideas   and this will be the salvation of the state   for those\\nwho rule must not be those who are desirous to rule   and   if you can\\noffer to our citizens a better life than that of rulers generally is  \\nthere will be a chance that the rich   not only in this world  s goods  \\nbut in virtue and wisdom   may bear rule   and the only life which is\\nbetter than the life of political ambition is that of philosophy   which\\nis also the best preparation for the government of a state  \\n\\nthen now comes the question  —how shall we create our rulers   what way\\nis there from darkness to light   the change is effected by philosophy  \\nit is not the turning over of an oyster  shell   but the conversion of a\\nsoul from night to day   from becoming to being   and what training will\\ndraw the soul upwards   our former education had two branches  \\ngymnastic   which was occupied with the body   and music   the sister art  \\nwhich infused a natural harmony into mind and literature   but neither\\nof these sciences gave any promise of doing what we want   nothing\\nremains to us but that universal or primary science of which all the\\narts and sciences are partakers   i mean number or calculation     very\\ntrue     including the art of war     yes   certainly     then there is\\nsomething ludicrous about palamedes in the tragedy   coming in and\\nsaying that he had invented number   and had counted the ranks and set\\nthem in order   for if agamemnon could not count his feet   and without\\nnumber how could he     he must have been a pretty sort of general\\nindeed   no man should be a soldier who cannot count   and indeed he is\\nhardly to be called a man   but i am not speaking of these practical\\napplications of arithmetic   for number   in my view   is rather to be\\nregarded as a conductor to thought and being   i will explain what i\\nmean by the last expression  —things sensible are of two kinds   the one\\nclass invite or stimulate the mind   while in the other the mind\\nacquiesces   now the stimulating class are the things which suggest\\ncontrast and relation   for example   suppose that i hold up to the eyes\\nthree fingers—a fore finger   a middle finger   a little finger—the sight\\nequally recognizes all three fingers   but without number cannot further\\ndistinguish them   or again   suppose two objects to be relatively great\\nand small   these ideas of greatness and smallness are supplied not by\\nthe sense   but by the mind   and the perception of their contrast or\\nrelation quickens and sets in motion the mind   which is puzzled by the\\nconfused intimations of sense   and has recourse to number in order to\\nfind out whether the things indicated are one or more than one   number\\nreplies that they are two and not one   and are to be distinguished from\\none another   again   the sight beholds great and small   but only in a\\nconfused chaos   and not until they are distinguished does the question\\narise of their respective natures   we are thus led on to the\\ndistinction between the visible and intelligible   that was what i meant\\nwhen i spoke of stimulants to the intellect   i was thinking of the\\ncontradictions which arise in perception   the idea of unity   for\\nexample   like that of a finger   does not arouse thought unless\\ninvolving some conception of plurality   but when the one is also the\\nopposite of one   the contradiction gives rise to reflection   an example\\nof this is afforded by any object of sight   all number has also an\\nelevating effect   it raises the mind out of the foam and flux of\\ngeneration to the contemplation of being   having lesser military and\\nretail uses also   the retail use is not required by us   but as our\\nguardian is to be a soldier as well as a philosopher   the military one\\nmay be retained   and to our higher purpose no science can be better\\nadapted   but it must be pursued in the spirit of a philosopher   not of\\na shopkeeper   it is concerned   not with visible objects   but with\\nabstract truth   for numbers are pure abstractions—the true\\narithmetician indignantly denies that his unit is capable of division  \\nwhen you divide   he insists that you are only multiplying   his   one   is\\nnot material or resolvable into fractions   but an unvarying and\\nabsolute equality   and this proves the purely intellectual character of\\nhis study   note also the great power which arithmetic has of sharpening\\nthe wits   no other discipline is equally severe   or an equal test of\\ngeneral ability   or equally improving to a stupid person  \\n\\nlet our second branch of education be geometry     i can easily see    \\nreplied glaucon     that the skill of the general will be doubled by his\\nknowledge of geometry     that is a small matter   the use of geometry   to\\nwhich i refer   is the assistance given by it in the contemplation of\\nthe idea of good   and the compelling the mind to look at true being  \\nand not at generation only   yet the present mode of pursuing these\\nstudies   as any one who is the least of a mathematician is aware   is\\nmean and ridiculous   they are made to look downwards to the arts   and\\nnot upwards to eternal existence   the geometer is always talking of\\nsquaring   subtending   apposing   as if he had in view action   whereas\\nknowledge is the real object of the study   it should elevate the soul  \\nand create the mind of philosophy   it should raise up what has fallen\\ndown   not to speak of lesser uses in war and military tactics   and in\\nthe improvement of the faculties  \\n\\nshall we propose   as a third branch of our education   astronomy     very\\ngood     replied glaucon     the knowledge of the heavens is necessary at\\nonce for husbandry   navigation   military tactics     i like your way of\\ngiving useful reasons for everything in order to make friends of the\\nworld   and there is a difficulty in proving to mankind that education\\nis not only useful information but a purification of the eye of the\\nsoul   which is better than the bodily eye   for by this alone is truth\\nseen   now   will you appeal to mankind in general or to the philosopher  \\nor would you prefer to look to yourself only     every man is his own\\nbest friend     then take a step backward   for we are out of order   and\\ninsert the third dimension which is of solids   after the second which\\nis of planes   and then you may proceed to solids in motion   but solid\\ngeometry is not popular and has not the patronage of the state   nor is\\nthe use of it fully recognized   the difficulty is great   and the\\nvotaries of the study are conceited and impatient   still the charm of\\nthe pursuit wins upon men   and   if government would lend a little\\nassistance   there might be great progress made     very true     replied\\nglaucon     but do i understand you now to begin with plane geometry   and\\nto place next geometry of solids   and thirdly   astronomy   or the motion\\nof solids     yes   i said   my hastiness has only hindered us  \\n\\n  very good   and now let us proceed to astronomy   about which i am\\nwilling to speak in your lofty strain   no one can fail to see that the\\ncontemplation of the heavens draws the soul upwards     i am an\\nexception   then   astronomy as studied at present appears to me to draw\\nthe soul not upwards   but downwards   star  gazing is just looking up at\\nthe ceiling—no better   a man may lie on his back on land or on water—he\\nmay look up or look down   but there is no science in that   the vision\\nof knowledge of which i speak is seen not with the eyes   but with the\\nmind   all the magnificence of the heavens is but the embroidery of a\\ncopy which falls far short of the divine original   and teaches nothing\\nabout the absolute harmonies or motions of things   their beauty is like\\nthe beauty of figures drawn by the hand of daedalus or any other great\\nartist   which may be used for illustration   but no mathematician would\\nseek to obtain from them true conceptions of equality or numerical\\nrelations   how ridiculous then to look for these in the map of the\\nheavens   in which the imperfection of matter comes in everywhere as a\\ndisturbing element   marring the symmetry of day and night   of months\\nand years   of the sun and stars in their courses   only by problems can\\nwe place astronomy on a truly scientific basis   let the heavens alone  \\nand exert the intellect  \\n\\nstill   mathematics admit of other applications   as the pythagoreans\\nsay   and we agree   there is a sister science of harmonical motion  \\nadapted to the ear as astronomy is to the eye   and there may be other\\napplications also   let us inquire of the pythagoreans about them   not\\nforgetting that we have an aim higher than theirs   which is the\\nrelation of these sciences to the idea of good   the error which\\npervades astronomy also pervades harmonics   the musicians put their\\nears in the place of their minds     yes     replied glaucon     i like to\\nsee them laying their ears alongside of their neighbours   faces—some\\nsaying     that  s a new note     others declaring that the two notes are\\nthe same     yes   i said   but you mean the empirics who are always\\ntwisting and torturing the strings of the lyre   and quarrelling about\\nthe tempers of the strings   i am referring rather to the pythagorean\\nharmonists   who are almost equally in error   for they investigate only\\nthe numbers of the consonances which are heard   and ascend no\\nhigher  —of the true numerical harmony which is unheard   and is only to\\nbe found in problems   they have not even a conception     that last     he\\nsaid     must be a marvellous thing     a thing   i replied   which is only\\nuseful if pursued with a view to the good  \\n\\nall these sciences are the prelude of the strain   and are profitable if\\nthey are regarded in their natural relations to one another     i dare\\nsay   socrates     said glaucon     but such a study will be an endless\\nbusiness     what study do you mean—of the prelude   or what   for all\\nthese things are only the prelude   and you surely do not suppose that a\\nmere mathematician is also a dialectician     certainly not   i have\\nhardly ever known a mathematician who could reason     and yet   glaucon  \\nis not true reasoning that hymn of dialectic which is the music of the\\nintellectual world   and which was by us compared to the effort of\\nsight   when from beholding the shadows on the wall we arrived at last\\nat the images which gave the shadows   even so the dialectical faculty\\nwithdrawing from sense arrives by the pure intellect at the\\ncontemplation of the idea of good   and never rests but at the very end\\nof the intellectual world   and the royal road out of the cave into the\\nlight   and the blinking of the eyes at the sun and turning to\\ncontemplate the shadows of reality   not the shadows of an image\\nonly—this progress and gradual acquisition of a new faculty of sight by\\nthe help of the mathematical sciences   is the elevation of the soul to\\nthe contemplation of the highest ideal of being  \\n\\n  so far   i agree with you   but now   leaving the prelude   let us proceed\\nto the hymn   what   then   is the nature of dialectic   and what are the\\npaths which lead thither     dear glaucon   you cannot follow me here  \\nthere can be no revelation of the absolute truth to one who has not\\nbeen disciplined in the previous sciences   but that there is a science\\nof absolute truth   which is attained in some way very different from\\nthose now practised   i am confident   for all other arts or sciences are\\nrelative to human needs and opinions   and the mathematical sciences are\\nbut a dream or hypothesis of true being   and never analyse their own\\nprinciples   dialectic alone rises to the principle which is above\\nhypotheses   converting and gently leading the eye of the soul out of\\nthe barbarous slough of ignorance into the light of the upper world  \\nwith the help of the sciences which we have been describing—sciences  \\nas they are often termed   although they require some other name  \\nimplying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than\\nscience   and this in our previous sketch was understanding   and so we\\nget four names—two for intellect   and two for opinion  —reason or mind  \\nunderstanding   faith   perception of shadows—which make a proportion—\\nbeing  becoming    intellect  opinion—and science  belief    understanding  \\nperception of shadows   dialectic may be further described as that\\nscience which defines and explains the essence or being of each nature  \\nwhich distinguishes and abstracts the good   and is ready to do battle\\nagainst all opponents in the cause of good   to him who is not a\\ndialectician life is but a sleepy dream   and many a man is in his grave\\nbefore his is well waked up   and would you have the future rulers of\\nyour ideal state intelligent beings   or stupid as posts     certainly not\\nthe latter     then you must train them in dialectic   which will teach\\nthem to ask and answer questions   and is the coping  stone of the\\nsciences  \\n\\ni dare say that you have not forgotten how our rulers were chosen   and\\nthe process of selection may be carried a step further  —as before   they\\nmust be constant and valiant   good  looking   and of noble manners   but\\nnow they must also have natural ability which education will improve  \\nthat is to say   they must be quick at learning   capable of mental toil  \\nretentive   solid   diligent natures   who combine intellectual with moral\\nvirtues   not lame and one  sided   diligent in bodily exercise and\\nindolent in mind   or conversely   not a maimed soul   which hates\\nfalsehood and yet unintentionally is always wallowing in the mire of\\nignorance   not a bastard or feeble person   but sound in wind and limb  \\nand in perfect condition for the great gymnastic trial of the mind  \\njustice herself can find no fault with natures such as these   and they\\nwill be the saviours of our state   disciples of another sort would only\\nmake philosophy more ridiculous than she is at present   forgive my\\nenthusiasm   i am becoming excited   but when i see her trampled\\nunderfoot   i am angry at the authors of her disgrace     i did not notice\\nthat you were more excited than you ought to have been     but i felt\\nthat i was   now do not let us forget another point in the selection of\\nour disciples—that they must be young and not old   for solon is\\nmistaken in saying that an old man can be always learning   youth is the\\ntime of study   and here we must remember that the mind is free and\\ndainty   and   unlike the body   must not be made to work against the\\ngrain   learning should be at first a sort of play   in which the natural\\nbent is detected   as in training them for war   the young dogs should at\\nfirst only taste blood   but when the necessary gymnastics are over\\nwhich during two or three years divide life between sleep and bodily\\nexercise   then the education of the soul will become a more serious\\nmatter   at twenty years of age   a selection must be made of the more\\npromising disciples   with whom a new epoch of education will begin   the\\nsciences which they have hitherto learned in fragments will now be\\nbrought into relation with each other and with true being   for the\\npower of combining them is the test of speculative and dialectical\\nability   and afterwards at thirty a further selection shall be made of\\nthose who are able to withdraw from the world of sense into the\\nabstraction of ideas   but at this point   judging from present\\nexperience   there is a danger that dialectic may be the source of many\\nevils   the danger may be illustrated by a parallel case  —imagine a\\nperson who has been brought up in wealth and luxury amid a crowd of\\nflatterers   and who is suddenly informed that he is a supposititious\\nson   he has hitherto honoured his reputed parents and disregarded the\\nflatterers   and now he does the reverse   this is just what happens with\\na man  s principles   there are certain doctrines which he learnt at home\\nand which exercised a parental authority over him   presently he finds\\nthat imputations are cast upon them   a troublesome querist comes and\\nasks     what is the just and good     or proves that virtue is vice and\\nvice virtue   and his mind becomes unsettled   and he ceases to love  \\nhonour   and obey them as he has hitherto done   he is seduced into the\\nlife of pleasure   and becomes a lawless person and a rogue   the case of\\nsuch speculators is very pitiable   and   in order that our thirty years  \\nold pupils may not require this pity   let us take every possible care\\nthat young persons do not study philosophy too early   for a young man\\nis a sort of puppy who only plays with an argument   and is reasoned\\ninto and out of his opinions every day   he soon begins to believe\\nnothing   and brings himself and philosophy into discredit   a man of\\nthirty does not run on in this way   he will argue and not merely\\ncontradict   and adds new honour to philosophy by the sobriety of his\\nconduct   what time shall we allow for this second gymnastic training of\\nthe soul  —say   twice the time required for the gymnastics of the body  \\nsix   or perhaps five years   to commence at thirty   and then for fifteen\\nyears let the student go down into the den   and command armies   and\\ngain experience of life   at fifty let him return to the end of all\\nthings   and have his eyes uplifted to the idea of good   and order his\\nlife after that pattern   if necessary   taking his turn at the helm of\\nstate   and training up others to be his successors   when his time comes\\nhe shall depart in peace to the islands of the blest   he shall be\\nhonoured with sacrifices   and receive such worship as the pythian\\noracle approves  \\n\\n  you are a statuary   socrates   and have made a perfect image of our\\ngovernors     yes   and of our governesses   for the women will share in\\nall things with the men   and you will admit that our state is not a\\nmere aspiration   but may really come into being when there shall arise\\nphilosopher  kings   one or more   who will despise earthly vanities   and\\nwill be the servants of justice only     and how will they begin their\\nwork     their first act will be to send away into the country all those\\nwho are more than ten years of age   and to proceed with those who are\\nleft      \\n\\nat the commencement of the sixth book   plato anticipated his\\nexplanation of the relation of the philosopher to the world in an\\nallegory   in this   as in other passages   following the order which he\\nprescribes in education   and proceeding from the concrete to the\\nabstract   at the commencement of book vii   under the figure of a cave\\nhaving an opening towards a fire and a way upwards to the true light  \\nhe returns to view the divisions of knowledge   exhibiting familiarly  \\nas in a picture   the result which had been hardly won by a great effort\\nof thought in the previous discussion   at the same time casting a\\nglance onward at the dialectical process   which is represented by the\\nway leading from darkness to light   the shadows   the images   the\\nreflection of the sun and stars in the water   the stars and sun\\nthemselves   severally correspond  —the first   to the realm of fancy and\\npoetry  —the second   to the world of sense  —the third   to the\\nabstractions or universals of sense   of which the mathematical sciences\\nfurnish the type  —the fourth and last to the same abstractions   when\\nseen in the unity of the idea   from which they derive a new meaning and\\npower   the true dialectical process begins with the contemplation of\\nthe real stars   and not mere reflections of them   and ends with the\\nrecognition of the sun   or idea of good   as the parent not only of\\nlight but of warmth and growth   to the divisions of knowledge the\\nstages of education partly answer  —first   there is the early education\\nof childhood and youth in the fancies of the poets   and in the laws and\\ncustoms of the state  —then there is the training of the body to be a\\nwarrior athlete   and a good servant of the mind  —and thirdly   after an\\ninterval follows the education of later life   which begins with\\nmathematics and proceeds to philosophy in general  \\n\\nthere seem to be two great aims in the philosophy of plato  —first   to\\nrealize abstractions   secondly   to connect them   according to him   the\\ntrue education is that which draws men from becoming to being   and to a\\ncomprehensive survey of all being   he desires to develop in the human\\nmind the faculty of seeing the universal in all things   until at last\\nthe particulars of sense drop away and the universal alone remains   he\\nthen seeks to combine the universals which he has disengaged from\\nsense   not perceiving that the correlation of them has no other basis\\nbut the common use of language   he never understands that abstractions  \\nas hegel says   are   mere abstractions  —of use when employed in the\\narrangement of facts   but adding nothing to the sum of knowledge when\\npursued apart from them   or with reference to an imaginary idea of\\ngood   still the exercise of the faculty of abstraction apart from facts\\nhas enlarged the mind   and played a great part in the education of the\\nhuman race   plato appreciated the value of this faculty   and saw that\\nit might be quickened by the study of number and relation   all things\\nin which there is opposition or proportion are suggestive of\\nreflection   the mere impression of sense evokes no power of thought or\\nof mind   but when sensible objects ask to be compared and\\ndistinguished   then philosophy begins   the science of arithmetic first\\nsuggests such distinctions   the follow in order the other sciences of\\nplain and solid geometry   and of solids in motion   one branch of which\\nis astronomy or the harmony of the spheres  —to this is appended the\\nsister science of the harmony of sounds   plato seems also to hint at\\nthe possibility of other applications of arithmetical or mathematical\\nproportions   such as we employ in chemistry and natural philosophy  \\nsuch as the pythagoreans and even aristotle make use of in ethics and\\npolitics   e  g   his distinction between arithmetical and geometrical\\nproportion in the ethics   book v     or between numerical and\\nproportional equality in the politics  \\n\\nthe modern mathematician will readily sympathise with plato  s delight\\nin the properties of pure mathematics   he will not be disinclined to\\nsay with him  —let alone the heavens   and study the beauties of number\\nand figure in themselves   he too will be apt to depreciate their\\napplication to the arts   he will observe that plato has a conception of\\ngeometry   in which figures are to be dispensed with   thus in a distant\\nand shadowy way seeming to anticipate the possibility of working\\ngeometrical problems by a more general mode of analysis   he will remark\\nwith interest on the backward state of solid geometry   which   alas   was\\nnot encouraged by the aid of the state in the age of plato   and he will\\nrecognize the grasp of plato  s mind in his ability to conceive of one\\nscience of solids in motion including the earth as well as the\\nheavens  —not forgetting to notice the intimation to which allusion has\\nbeen already made   that besides astronomy and harmonics the science of\\nsolids in motion may have other applications   still more will he be\\nstruck with the comprehensiveness of view which led plato   at a time\\nwhen these sciences hardly existed   to say that they must be studied in\\nrelation to one another   and to the idea of good   or common principle\\nof truth and being   but he will also see   and perhaps without surprise  \\nthat in that stage of physical and mathematical knowledge   plato has\\nfallen into the error of supposing that he can construct the heavens a\\npriori by mathematical problems   and determine the principles of\\nharmony irrespective of the adaptation of sounds to the human ear   the\\nillusion was a natural one in that age and country   the simplicity and\\ncertainty of astronomy and harmonics seemed to contrast with the\\nvariation and complexity of the world of sense   hence the circumstance\\nthat there was some elementary basis of fact   some measurement of\\ndistance or time or vibrations on which they must ultimately rest   was\\noverlooked by him   the modern predecessors of newton fell into errors\\nequally great   and plato can hardly be said to have been very far\\nwrong   or may even claim a sort of prophetic insight into the subject  \\nwhen we consider that the greater part of astronomy at the present day\\nconsists of abstract dynamics   by the help of which most astronomical\\ndiscoveries have been made  \\n\\nthe metaphysical philosopher from his point of view recognizes\\nmathematics as an instrument of education  —which strengthens the power\\nof attention   developes the sense of order and the faculty of\\nconstruction   and enables the mind to grasp under simple formulae the\\nquantitative differences of physical phenomena   but while acknowledging\\ntheir value in education   he sees also that they have no connexion with\\nour higher moral and intellectual ideas   in the attempt which plato\\nmakes to connect them   we easily trace the influences of ancient\\npythagorean notions   there is no reason to suppose that he is speaking\\nof the ideal numbers   but he is describing numbers which are pure\\nabstractions   to which he assigns a real and separate existence   which  \\nas   the teachers of the art     meaning probably the pythagoreans   would\\nhave affirmed   repel all attempts at subdivision   and in which unity\\nand every other number are conceived of as absolute   the truth and\\ncertainty of numbers   when thus disengaged from phenomena   gave them a\\nkind of sacredness in the eyes of an ancient philosopher   nor is it\\neasy to say how far ideas of order and fixedness may have had a moral\\nand elevating influence on the minds of men     who     in the words of the\\ntimaeus     might learn to regulate their erring lives according to\\nthem     it is worthy of remark that the old pythagorean ethical symbols\\nstill exist as figures of speech among ourselves   and those who in\\nmodern times see the world pervaded by universal law   may also see an\\nanticipation of this last word of modern philosophy in the platonic\\nidea of good   which is the source and measure of all things   and yet\\nonly an abstraction   philebus    \\n\\ntwo passages seem to require more particular explanations   first   that\\nwhich relates to the analysis of vision   the difficulty in this passage\\nmay be explained   like many others   from differences in the modes of\\nconception prevailing among ancient and modern thinkers   to us   the\\nperceptions of sense are inseparable from the act of the mind which\\naccompanies them   the consciousness of form   colour   distance   is\\nindistinguishable from the simple sensation   which is the medium of\\nthem   whereas to plato sense is the heraclitean flux of sense   not the\\nvision of objects in the order in which they actually present\\nthemselves to the experienced sight   but as they may be imagined to\\nappear confused and blurred to the half  awakened eye of the infant   the\\nfirst action of the mind is aroused by the attempt to set in order this\\nchaos   and the reason is required to frame distinct conceptions under\\nwhich the confused impressions of sense may be arranged   hence arises\\nthe question     what is great   what is small     and thus begins the\\ndistinction of the visible and the intelligible  \\n\\nthe second difficulty relates to plato  s conception of harmonics   three\\nclasses of harmonists are distinguished by him  —first   the\\npythagoreans   whom he proposes to consult as in the previous discussion\\non music he was to consult damon—they are acknowledged to be masters in\\nthe art   but are altogether deficient in the knowledge of its higher\\nimport and relation to the good   secondly   the mere empirics   whom\\nglaucon appears to confuse with them   and whom both he and socrates\\nludicrously describe as experimenting by mere auscultation on the\\nintervals of sounds   both of these fall short in different degrees of\\nthe platonic idea of harmony   which must be studied in a purely\\nabstract way   first by the method of problems   and secondly as a part\\nof universal knowledge in relation to the idea of good  \\n\\nthe allegory has a political as well as a philosophical meaning   the\\nden or cave represents the narrow sphere of politics or law   compare\\nthe description of the philosopher and lawyer in the theaetetus     and\\nthe light of the eternal ideas is supposed to exercise a disturbing\\ninfluence on the minds of those who return to this lower world   in\\nother words   their principles are too wide for practical application  \\nthey are looking far away into the past and future   when their business\\nis with the present   the ideal is not easily reduced to the conditions\\nof actual life   and may often be at variance with them   and at first  \\nthose who return are unable to compete with the inhabitants of the den\\nin the measurement of the shadows   and are derided and persecuted by\\nthem   but after a while they see the things below in far truer\\nproportions than those who have never ascended into the upper world  \\nthe difference between the politician turned into a philosopher and the\\nphilosopher turned into a politician   is symbolized by the two kinds of\\ndisordered eyesight   the one which is experienced by the captive who is\\ntransferred from darkness to day   the other   of the heavenly messenger\\nwho voluntarily for the good of his fellow  men descends into the den  \\nin what way the brighter light is to dawn on the inhabitants of the\\nlower world   or how the idea of good is to become the guiding principle\\nof politics   is left unexplained by plato   like the nature and\\ndivisions of dialectic   of which glaucon impatiently demands to be\\ninformed   perhaps he would have said that the explanation could not be\\ngiven except to a disciple of the previous sciences     symposium    \\n\\nmany illustrations of this part of the republic may be found in modern\\npolitics and in daily life   for among ourselves   too   there have been\\ntwo sorts of politicians or statesmen   whose eyesight has become\\ndisordered in two different ways   first   there have been great men who  \\nin the language of burke     have been too much given to general maxims    \\nwho   like j  s   mill or burke himself   have been theorists or\\nphilosophers before they were politicians   or who   having been students\\nof history   have allowed some great historical parallel   such as the\\nenglish revolution of 1688   or possibly athenian democracy or roman\\nimperialism   to be the medium through which they viewed contemporary\\nevents   or perhaps the long projecting shadow of some existing\\ninstitution may have darkened their vision   the church of the future  \\nthe commonwealth of the future   the society of the future   have so\\nabsorbed their minds   that they are unable to see in their true\\nproportions the politics of to  day   they have been intoxicated with\\ngreat ideas   such as liberty   or equality   or the greatest happiness of\\nthe greatest number   or the brotherhood of humanity   and they no longer\\ncare to consider how these ideas must be limited in practice or\\nharmonized with the conditions of human life   they are full of light  \\nbut the light to them has become only a sort of luminous mist or\\nblindness   almost every one has known some enthusiastic half  educated\\nperson   who sees everything at false distances   and in erroneous\\nproportions  \\n\\nwith this disorder of eyesight may be contrasted another—of those who\\nsee not far into the distance   but what is near only   who have been\\nengaged all their lives in a trade or a profession   who are limited to\\na set or sect of their own   men of this kind have no universal except\\ntheir own interests or the interests of their class   no principle but\\nthe opinion of persons like themselves   no knowledge of affairs beyond\\nwhat they pick up in the streets or at their club   suppose them to be\\nsent into a larger world   to undertake some higher calling   from being\\ntradesmen to turn generals or politicians   from being schoolmasters to\\nbecome philosophers  —or imagine them on a sudden to receive an inward\\nlight which reveals to them for the first time in their lives a higher\\nidea of god and the existence of a spiritual world   by this sudden\\nconversion or change is not their daily life likely to be upset   and on\\nthe other hand will not many of their old prejudices and narrownesses\\nstill adhere to them long after they have begun to take a more\\ncomprehensive view of human things   from familiar examples like these\\nwe may learn what plato meant by the eyesight which is liable to two\\nkinds of disorders  \\n\\nnor have we any difficulty in drawing a parallel between the young\\nathenian in the fifth century before christ who became unsettled by new\\nideas   and the student of a modern university who has been the subject\\nof a similar   aufklärung     we too observe that when young men begin to\\ncriticise customary beliefs   or to analyse the constitution of human\\nnature   they are apt to lose hold of solid principle   ἅπαν τὸ βέβαιον\\nαὐτῶν ἐξοίχεται     they are like trees which have been frequently\\ntransplanted   the earth about them is loose   and they have no roots\\nreaching far into the soil   they   light upon every flower     following\\ntheir own wayward wills   or because the wind blows them   they catch\\nopinions   as diseases are caught—when they are in the air   borne hither\\nand thither     they speedily fall into beliefs   the opposite of those in\\nwhich they were brought up   they hardly retain the distinction of right\\nand wrong   they seem to think one thing as good as another   they\\nsuppose themselves to be searching after truth when they are playing\\nthe game of   follow my leader     they fall in love   at first sight   with\\nparadoxes respecting morality   some fancy about art   some novelty or\\neccentricity in religion   and like lovers they are so absorbed for a\\ntime in their new notion that they can think of nothing else   the\\nresolution of some philosophical or theological question seems to them\\nmore interesting and important than any substantial knowledge of\\nliterature or science or even than a good life   like the youth in the\\nphilebus   they are ready to discourse to any one about a new\\nphilosophy   they are generally the disciples of some eminent professor\\nor sophist   whom they rather imitate than understand   they may be\\ncounted happy if in later years they retain some of the simple truths\\nwhich they acquired in early education   and which they may   perhaps  \\nfind to be worth all the rest   such is the picture which plato draws\\nand which we only reproduce   partly in his own words   of the dangers\\nwhich beset youth in times of transition   when old opinions are fading\\naway and the new are not yet firmly established   their condition is\\ningeniously compared by him to that of a supposititious son   who has\\nmade the discovery that his reputed parents are not his real ones   and  \\nin consequence   they have lost their authority over him  \\n\\nthe distinction between the mathematician and the dialectician is also\\nnoticeable   plato is very well aware that the faculty of the\\nmathematician is quite distinct from the higher philosophical sense\\nwhich recognizes and combines first principles   the contempt which he\\nexpresses for distinctions of words   the danger of involuntary\\nfalsehood   the apology which socrates makes for his earnestness of\\nspeech   are highly characteristic of the platonic style and mode of\\nthought   the quaint notion that if palamedes was the inventor of number\\nagamemnon could not have counted his feet   the art by which we are made\\nto believe that this state of ours is not a dream only   the gravity\\nwith which the first step is taken in the actual creation of the state  \\nnamely   the sending out of the city all who had arrived at ten years of\\nage   in order to expedite the business of education by a generation  \\nare also truly platonic     for the last   compare the passage at the end\\nof the third book   in which he expects the lie about the earthborn men\\nto be believed in the second generation    \\n\\nbook viii   and so we have arrived at the conclusion   that in the\\nperfect state wives and children are to be in common   and the education\\nand pursuits of men and women   both in war and peace   are to be common  \\nand kings are to be philosophers and warriors   and the soldiers of the\\nstate are to live together   having all things in common   and they are\\nto be warrior athletes   receiving no pay but only their food   from the\\nother citizens   now let us return to the point at which we digressed  \\n  that is easily done     he replied     you were speaking of the state\\nwhich you had constructed   and of the individual who answered to this  \\nboth of whom you affirmed to be good   and you said that of inferior\\nstates there were four forms and four individuals corresponding to\\nthem   which although deficient in various degrees   were all of them\\nworth inspecting with a view to determining the relative happiness or\\nmisery of the best or worst man   then polemarchus and adeimantus\\ninterrupted you   and this led to another argument  —and so here we are    \\nsuppose that we put ourselves again in the same position   and do you\\nrepeat your question     i should like to know of what constitutions you\\nwere speaking     besides the perfect state there are only four of any\\nnote in hellas  —first   the famous lacedaemonian or cretan commonwealth  \\nsecondly   oligarchy   a state full of evils   thirdly   democracy   which\\nfollows next in order   fourthly   tyranny   which is the disease or death\\nof all government   now   states are not made of   oak and rock     but of\\nflesh and blood   and therefore as there are five states there must be\\nfive human natures in individuals   which correspond to them   and first  \\nthere is the ambitious nature   which answers to the lacedaemonian\\nstate   secondly   the oligarchical nature   thirdly   the democratical  \\nand fourthly   the tyrannical   this last will have to be compared with\\nthe perfectly just   which is the fifth   that we may know which is the\\nhappier   and then we shall be able to determine whether the argument of\\nthrasymachus or our own is the more convincing   and as before we began\\nwith the state and went on to the individual   so now   beginning with\\ntimocracy   let us go on to the timocratical man   and then proceed to\\nthe other forms of government   and the individuals who answer to them  \\n\\nbut how did timocracy arise out of the perfect state   plainly   like all\\nchanges of government   from division in the rulers   but whence came\\ndivision     sing   heavenly muses     as homer says  —let them condescend to\\nanswer us   as if we were children   to whom they put on a solemn face in\\njest     and what will they say     they will say that human things are\\nfated to decay   and even the perfect state will not escape from this\\nlaw of destiny   when   the wheel comes full circle   in a period short or\\nlong   plants or animals have times of fertility and sterility   which\\nthe intelligence of rulers because alloyed by sense will not enable\\nthem to ascertain   and children will be born out of season   for whereas\\ndivine creations are in a perfect cycle or number   the human creation\\nis in a number which declines from perfection   and has four terms and\\nthree intervals of numbers   increasing   waning   assimilating  \\ndissimilating   and yet perfectly commensurate with each other   the base\\nof the number with a fourth added   or which is 3  4     multiplied by five\\nand cubed   gives two harmonies  —the first a square number   which is a\\nhundred times the base   or a hundred times a hundred     the second   an\\noblong   being a hundred squares of the rational diameter of a figure\\nthe side of which is five   subtracting one from each square or two\\nperfect squares from all   and adding a hundred cubes of three   this\\nentire number is geometrical and contains the rule or law of\\ngeneration   when this law is neglected marriages will be unpropitious  \\nthe inferior offspring who are then born will in time become the\\nrulers   the state will decline   and education fall into decay  \\ngymnastic will be preferred to music   and the gold and silver and brass\\nand iron will form a chaotic mass—thus division will arise   such is the\\nmuses   answer to our question     and a true answer   of course  —but what\\nmore have they to say     they say that the two races   the iron and\\nbrass   and the silver and gold   will draw the state different ways  —the\\none will take to trade and moneymaking   and the others   having the true\\nriches and not caring for money   will resist them   the contest will end\\nin a compromise   they will agree to have private property   and will\\nenslave their fellow  citizens who were once their friends and\\nnurturers   but they will retain their warlike character   and will be\\nchiefly occupied in fighting and exercising rule   thus arises\\ntimocracy   which is intermediate between aristocracy and oligarchy  \\n\\nthe new form of government resembles the ideal in obedience to rulers\\nand contempt for trade   and having common meals   and in devotion to\\nwarlike and gymnastic exercises   but corruption has crept into\\nphilosophy   and simplicity of character   which was once her note   is\\nnow looked for only in the military class   arts of war begin to prevail\\nover arts of peace   the ruler is no longer a philosopher   as in\\noligarchies   there springs up among them an extravagant love of\\ngain—get another man  s and save your own   is their principle   and they\\nhave dark places in which they hoard their gold and silver   for the use\\nof their women and others   they take their pleasures by stealth   like\\nboys who are running away from their father—the law   and their\\neducation is not inspired by the muse   but imposed by the strong arm of\\npower   the leading characteristic of this state is party spirit and\\nambition  \\n\\nand what manner of man answers to such a state     in love of\\ncontention     replied adeimantus     he will be like our friend glaucon    \\nin that respect   perhaps   but not in others   he is self  asserting and\\nill  educated   yet fond of literature   although not himself a\\nspeaker  —fierce with slaves   but obedient to rulers   a lover of power\\nand honour   which he hopes to gain by deeds of arms  —fond   too   of\\ngymnastics and of hunting   as he advances in years he grows avaricious  \\nfor he has lost philosophy   which is the only saviour and guardian of\\nmen   his origin is as follows  —his father is a good man dwelling in an\\nill  ordered state   who has retired from politics in order that he may\\nlead a quiet life   his mother is angry at her loss of precedence among\\nother women   she is disgusted at her husband  s selfishness   and she\\nexpatiates to her son on the unmanliness and indolence of his father  \\nthe old family servant takes up the tale   and says to the youth  —  when\\nyou grow up you must be more of a man than your father     all the world\\nare agreed that he who minds his own business is an idiot   while a\\nbusybody is highly honoured and esteemed   the young man compares this\\nspirit with his father  s words and ways   and as he is naturally well\\ndisposed   although he has suffered from evil influences   he rests at a\\nmiddle point and becomes ambitious and a lover of honour  \\n\\nand now let us set another city over against another man   the next form\\nof government is oligarchy   in which the rule is of the rich only   nor\\nis it difficult to see how such a state arises   the decline begins with\\nthe possession of gold and silver   illegal modes of expenditure are\\ninvented   one draws another on   and the multitude are infected   riches\\noutweigh virtue   lovers of money take the place of lovers of honour  \\nmisers of politicians   and   in time   political privileges are confined\\nby law to the rich   who do not shrink from violence in order to effect\\ntheir purposes  \\n\\nthus much of the origin  —let us next consider the evils of oligarchy  \\nwould a man who wanted to be safe on a voyage take a bad pilot because\\nhe was rich   or refuse a good one because he was poor   and does not the\\nanalogy apply still more to the state   and there are yet greater evils  \\ntwo nations are struggling together in one—the rich and the poor   and\\nthe rich dare not put arms into the hands of the poor   and are\\nunwilling to pay for defenders out of their own money   and have we not\\nalready condemned that state in which the same persons are warriors as\\nwell as shopkeepers   the greatest evil of all is that a man may sell\\nhis property and have no place in the state   while there is one class\\nwhich has enormous wealth   the other is entirely destitute   but observe\\nthat these destitutes had not really any more of the governing nature\\nin them when they were rich than now that they are poor   they were\\nmiserable spendthrifts always   they are the drones of the hive   only\\nwhereas the actual drone is unprovided by nature with a sting   the\\ntwo  legged things whom we call drones are some of them without stings\\nand some of them have dreadful stings   in other words   there are\\npaupers and there are rogues   these are never far apart   and in\\noligarchical cities   where nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a\\nruler   you will find abundance of both   and this evil state of society\\noriginates in bad education and bad government  \\n\\nlike state   like man  —the change in the latter begins with the\\nrepresentative of timocracy   he walks at first in the ways of his\\nfather   who may have been a statesman   or general   perhaps   and\\npresently he sees him   fallen from his high estate     the victim of\\ninformers   dying in prison or exile   or by the hand of the executioner  \\nthe lesson which he thus receives   makes him cautious   he leaves\\npolitics   represses his pride   and saves pence   avarice is enthroned as\\nhis bosom  s lord   and assumes the style of the great king   the rational\\nand spirited elements sit humbly on the ground at either side   the one\\nimmersed in calculation   the other absorbed in the admiration of\\nwealth   the love of honour turns to love of money   the conversion is\\ninstantaneous   the man is mean   saving   toiling   the slave of one\\npassion which is the master of the rest   is he not the very image of\\nthe state   he has had no education   or he would never have allowed the\\nblind god of riches to lead the dance within him   and being uneducated\\nhe will have many slavish desires   some beggarly   some knavish  \\nbreeding in his soul   if he is the trustee of an orphan   and has the\\npower to defraud   he will soon prove that he is not without the will  \\nand that his passions are only restrained by fear and not by reason  \\nhence he leads a divided existence   in which the better desires mostly\\nprevail   but when he is contending for prizes and other distinctions  \\nhe is afraid to incur a loss which is to be repaid only by barren\\nhonour   in time of war he fights with a small part of his resources  \\nand usually keeps his money and loses the victory  \\n\\nnext comes democracy and the democratic man   out of oligarchy and the\\noligarchical man   insatiable avarice is the ruling passion of an\\noligarchy   and they encourage expensive habits in order that they may\\ngain by the ruin of extravagant youth   thus men of family often lose\\ntheir property or rights of citizenship   but they remain in the city  \\nfull of hatred against the new owners of their estates and ripe for\\nrevolution   the usurer with stooping walk pretends not to see them   he\\npasses by   and leaves his sting—that is   his money—in some other\\nvictim   and many a man has to pay the parent or principal sum\\nmultiplied into a family of children   and is reduced into a state of\\ndronage by him   the only way of diminishing the evil is either to limit\\na man in his use of his property   or to insist that he shall lend at\\nhis own risk   but the ruling class do not want remedies   they care only\\nfor money   and are as careless of virtue as the poorest of the\\ncitizens   now there are occasions on which the governors and the\\ngoverned meet together  —at festivals   on a journey   voyaging or\\nfighting   the sturdy pauper finds that in the hour of danger he is not\\ndespised   he sees the rich man puffing and panting   and draws the\\nconclusion which he privately imparts to his companions  —  that our\\npeople are not good for much     and as a sickly frame is made ill by a\\nmere touch from without   or sometimes without external impulse is ready\\nto fall to pieces of itself   so from the least cause   or with none at\\nall   the city falls ill and fights a battle for life or death   and\\ndemocracy comes into power when the poor are the victors   killing some\\nand exiling some   and giving equal shares in the government to all the\\nrest  \\n\\nthe manner of life in such a state is that of democrats   there is\\nfreedom and plainness of speech   and every man does what is right in\\nhis own eyes   and has his own way of life   hence arise the most various\\ndevelopments of character   the state is like a piece of embroidery of\\nwhich the colours and figures are the manners of men   and there are\\nmany who   like women and children   prefer this variety to real beauty\\nand excellence   the state is not one but many   like a bazaar at which\\nyou can buy anything   the great charm is   that you may do as you like  \\nyou may govern if you like   let it alone if you like   go to war and\\nmake peace if you feel disposed   and all quite irrespective of anybody\\nelse   when you condemn men to death they remain alive all the same   a\\ngentleman is desired to go into exile   and he stalks about the streets\\nlike a hero   and nobody sees him or cares for him   observe   too   how\\ngrandly democracy sets her foot upon all our fine theories of\\neducation  —how little she cares for the training of her statesmen   the\\nonly qualification which she demands is the profession of patriotism  \\nsuch is democracy  —a pleasing   lawless   various sort of government  \\ndistributing equality to equals and unequals alike  \\n\\nlet us now inspect the individual democrat   and first   as in the case\\nof the state   we will trace his antecedents   he is the son of a miserly\\noligarch   and has been taught by him to restrain the love of\\nunnecessary pleasures   perhaps i ought to explain this latter\\nterm  —necessary pleasures are those which are good   and which we cannot\\ndo without   unnecessary pleasures are those which do no good   and of\\nwhich the desire might be eradicated by early training   for example  \\nthe pleasures of eating and drinking are necessary and healthy   up to a\\ncertain point   beyond that point they are alike hurtful to body and\\nmind   and the excess may be avoided   when in excess   they may be\\nrightly called expensive pleasures   in opposition to the useful ones  \\nand the drone   as we called him   is the slave of these unnecessary\\npleasures and desires   whereas the miserly oligarch is subject only to\\nthe necessary  \\n\\nthe oligarch changes into the democrat in the following manner  —the\\nyouth who has had a miserly bringing up   gets a taste of the drone  s\\nhoney   he meets with wild companions   who introduce him to every new\\npleasure   as in the state   so in the individual   there are allies on\\nboth sides   temptations from without and passions from within   there is\\nreason also and external influences of parents and friends in alliance\\nwith the oligarchical principle   and the two factions are in violent\\nconflict with one another   sometimes the party of order prevails   but\\nthen again new desires and new disorders arise   and the whole mob of\\npassions gets possession of the acropolis   that is to say   the soul  \\nwhich they find void and unguarded by true words and works   falsehoods\\nand illusions ascend to take their place   the prodigal goes back into\\nthe country of the lotophagi or drones   and openly dwells there   and if\\nany offer of alliance or parley of individual elders comes from home  \\nthe false spirits shut the gates of the castle and permit no one to\\nenter  —there is a battle   and they gain the victory   and straightway\\nmaking alliance with the desires   they banish modesty   which they call\\nfolly   and send temperance over the border   when the house has been\\nswept and garnished   they dress up the exiled vices   and   crowning them\\nwith garlands   bring them back under new names   insolence they call\\ngood breeding   anarchy freedom   waste magnificence   impudence courage  \\nsuch is the process by which the youth passes from the necessary\\npleasures to the unnecessary   after a while he divides his time\\nimpartially between them   and perhaps   when he gets older and the\\nviolence of passion has abated   he restores some of the exiles and\\nlives in a sort of equilibrium   indulging first one pleasure and then\\nanother   and if reason comes and tells him that some pleasures are good\\nand honourable   and others bad and vile   he shakes his head and says\\nthat he can make no distinction between them   thus he lives in the\\nfancy of the hour   sometimes he takes to drink   and then he turns\\nabstainer   he practises in the gymnasium or he does nothing at all  \\nthen again he would be a philosopher or a politician   or again   he\\nwould be a warrior or a man of business   he is\\n\\n  every thing by starts and nothing long    \\n\\n\\nthere remains still the finest and fairest of all men and all\\nstates—tyranny and the tyrant   tyranny springs from democracy much as\\ndemocracy springs from oligarchy   both arise from excess   the one from\\nexcess of wealth   the other from excess of freedom     the great natural\\ngood of life     says the democrat     is freedom     and this exclusive love\\nof freedom and regardlessness of everything else   is the cause of the\\nchange from democracy to tyranny   the state demands the strong wine of\\nfreedom   and unless her rulers give her a plentiful draught   punishes\\nand insults them   equality and fraternity of governors and governed is\\nthe approved principle   anarchy is the law   not of the state only   but\\nof private houses   and extends even to the animals   father and son  \\ncitizen and foreigner   teacher and pupil   old and young   are all on a\\nlevel   fathers and teachers fear their sons and pupils   and the wisdom\\nof the young man is a match for the elder   and the old imitate the\\njaunty manners of the young because they are afraid of being thought\\nmorose   slaves are on a level with their masters and mistresses   and\\nthere is no difference between men and women   nay   the very animals in\\na democratic state have a freedom which is unknown in other places   the\\nshe  dogs are as good as their she  mistresses   and horses and asses\\nmarch along with dignity and run their noses against anybody who comes\\nin their way     that has often been my experience     at last the citizens\\nbecome so sensitive that they cannot endure the yoke of laws   written\\nor unwritten   they would have no man call himself their master   such is\\nthe glorious beginning of things out of which tyranny springs  \\n  glorious   indeed   but what is to follow     the ruin of oligarchy is the\\nruin of democracy   for there is a law of contraries   the excess of\\nfreedom passes into the excess of slavery   and the greater the freedom\\nthe greater the slavery   you will remember that in the oligarchy were\\nfound two classes—rogues and paupers   whom we compared to drones with\\nand without stings   these two classes are to the state what phlegm and\\nbile are to the human body   and the state  physician   or legislator  \\nmust get rid of them   just as the bee  master keeps the drones out of\\nthe hive   now in a democracy   too   there are drones   but they are more\\nnumerous and more dangerous than in the oligarchy   there they are inert\\nand unpractised   here they are full of life and animation   and the\\nkeener sort speak and act   while the others buzz about the bema and\\nprevent their opponents from being heard   and there is another class in\\ndemocratic states   of respectable   thriving individuals   who can be\\nsqueezed when the drones have need of their possessions   there is\\nmoreover a third class   who are the labourers and the artisans   and\\nthey make up the mass of the people   when the people meet   they are\\nomnipotent   but they cannot be brought together unless they are\\nattracted by a little honey   and the rich are made to supply the honey  \\nof which the demagogues keep the greater part themselves   giving a\\ntaste only to the mob   their victims attempt to resist   they are driven\\nmad by the stings of the drones   and so become downright oligarchs in\\nself  defence   then follow informations and convictions for treason   the\\npeople have some protector whom they nurse into greatness   and from\\nthis root the tree of tyranny springs   the nature of the change is\\nindicated in the old fable of the temple of zeus lycaeus   which tells\\nhow he who tastes human flesh mixed up with the flesh of other victims\\nwill turn into a wolf   even so the protector   who tastes human blood  \\nand slays some and exiles others with or without law   who hints at\\nabolition of debts and division of lands   must either perish or become\\na wolf—that is   a tyrant   perhaps he is driven out   but he soon comes\\nback from exile   and then if his enemies cannot get rid of him by\\nlawful means   they plot his assassination   thereupon the friend of the\\npeople makes his well  known request to them for a body  guard   which\\nthey readily grant   thinking only of his danger and not of their own  \\nnow let the rich man make to himself wings   for he will never run away\\nagain if he does not do so then   and the great protector   having\\ncrushed all his rivals   stands proudly erect in the chariot of state   a\\nfull  blown tyrant   let us enquire into the nature of his happiness  \\n\\nin the early days of his tyranny he smiles and beams upon everybody   he\\nis not a   dominus     no   not he   he has only come to put an end to debt\\nand the monopoly of land   having got rid of foreign enemies   he makes\\nhimself necessary to the state by always going to war   he is thus\\nenabled to depress the poor by heavy taxes   and so keep them at work  \\nand he can get rid of bolder spirits by handing them over to the enemy  \\nthen comes unpopularity   some of his old associates have the courage to\\noppose him   the consequence is   that he has to make a purgation of the\\nstate   but   unlike the physician who purges away the bad   he must get\\nrid of the high  spirited   the wise and the wealthy   for he has no\\nchoice between death and a life of shame and dishonour   and the more\\nhated he is   the more he will require trusty guards   but how will he\\nobtain them     they will come flocking like birds—for pay     will he not\\nrather obtain them on the spot   he will take the slaves from their\\nowners and make them his body  guard   these are his trusted friends   who\\nadmire and look up to him   are not the tragic poets wise who magnify\\nand exalt the tyrant   and say that he is wise by association with the\\nwise   and are not their praises of tyranny alone a sufficient reason\\nwhy we should exclude them from our state   they may go to other cities  \\nand gather the mob about them with fine words   and change commonwealths\\ninto tyrannies and democracies   receiving honours and rewards for their\\nservices   but the higher they and their friends ascend constitution\\nhill   the more their honour will fail and become   too asthmatic to\\nmount     to return to the tyrant—how will he support that rare army of\\nhis   first   by robbing the temples of their treasures   which will\\nenable him to lighten the taxes   then he will take all his father  s\\nproperty   and spend it on his companions   male or female   now his\\nfather is the demus   and if the demus gets angry   and says that a great\\nhulking son ought not to be a burden on his parents   and bids him and\\nhis riotous crew begone   then will the parent know what a monster he\\nhas been nurturing   and that the son whom he would fain expel is too\\nstrong for him     you do not mean to say that he will beat his father    \\nyes   he will   after having taken away his arms     then he is a parricide\\nand a cruel   unnatural son     and the people have jumped from the fear\\nof slavery into slavery   out of the smoke into the fire   thus liberty  \\nwhen out of all order and reason   passes into the worst form of\\nservitude      \\n\\nin the previous books plato has described the ideal state   now he\\nreturns to the perverted or declining forms   on which he had lightly\\ntouched at the end of book iv   these he describes in a succession of\\nparallels between the individuals and the states   tracing the origin of\\neither in the state or individual which has preceded them   he begins by\\nasking the point at which he digressed   and is thus led shortly to\\nrecapitulate the substance of the three former books   which also\\ncontain a parallel of the philosopher and the state  \\n\\nof the first decline he gives no intelligible account   he would not\\nhave liked to admit the most probable causes of the fall of his ideal\\nstate   which to us would appear to be the impracticability of communism\\nor the natural antagonism of the ruling and subject classes   he throws\\na veil of mystery over the origin of the decline   which he attributes\\nto ignorance of the law of population   of this law the famous\\ngeometrical figure or number is the expression   like the ancients in\\ngeneral   he had no idea of the gradual perfectibility of man or of the\\neducation of the human race   his ideal was not to be attained in the\\ncourse of ages   but was to spring in full armour from the head of the\\nlegislator   when good laws had been given   he thought only of the\\nmanner in which they were likely to be corrupted   or of how they might\\nbe filled up in detail or restored in accordance with their original\\nspirit   he appears not to have reflected upon the full meaning of his\\nown words     in the brief space of human life   nothing great can be\\naccomplished     or again   as he afterwards says in the laws     infinite\\ntime is the maker of cities     the order of constitutions which is\\nadopted by him represents an order of thought rather than a succession\\nof time   and may be considered as the first attempt to frame a\\nphilosophy of history  \\n\\nthe first of these declining states is timocracy   or the government of\\nsoldiers and lovers of honour   which answers to the spartan state   this\\nis a government of force   in which education is not inspired by the\\nmuses   but imposed by the law   and in which all the finer elements of\\norganization have disappeared   the philosopher himself has lost the\\nlove of truth   and the soldier   who is of a simpler and honester\\nnature   rules in his stead   the individual who answers to timocracy has\\nsome noticeable qualities   he is described as ill educated   but   like\\nthe spartan   a lover of literature   and although he is a harsh master\\nto his servants he has no natural superiority over them   his character\\nis based upon a reaction against the circumstances of his father   who\\nin a troubled city has retired from politics   and his mother   who is\\ndissatisfied at her own position   is always urging him towards the life\\nof political ambition   such a character may have had this origin   and\\nindeed livy attributes the licinian laws to a feminine jealousy of a\\nsimilar kind   but there is obviously no connection between the manner\\nin which the timocratic state springs out of the ideal   and the mere\\naccident by which the timocratic man is the son of a retired statesman  \\n\\nthe two next stages in the decline of constitutions have even less\\nhistorical foundation   for there is no trace in greek history of a\\npolity like the spartan or cretan passing into an oligarchy of wealth  \\nor of the oligarchy of wealth passing into a democracy   the order of\\nhistory appears to be different   first   in the homeric times there is\\nthe royal or patriarchal form of government   which a century or two\\nlater was succeeded by an oligarchy of birth rather than of wealth   and\\nin which wealth was only the accident of the hereditary possession of\\nland and power   sometimes this oligarchical government gave way to a\\ngovernment based upon a qualification of property   which   according to\\naristotle  s mode of using words   would have been called a timocracy  \\nand this in some cities   as at athens   became the conducting medium to\\ndemocracy   but such was not the necessary order of succession in\\nstates   nor   indeed   can any order be discerned in the endless\\nfluctuation of greek history   like the tides in the euripus     except  \\nperhaps   in the almost uniform tendency from monarchy to aristocracy in\\nthe earliest times   at first sight there appears to be a similar\\ninversion in the last step of the platonic succession   for tyranny  \\ninstead of being the natural end of democracy   in early greek history\\nappears rather as a stage leading to democracy   the reign of\\npeisistratus and his sons is an episode which comes between the\\nlegislation of solon and the constitution of cleisthenes   and some\\nsecret cause common to them all seems to have led the greater part of\\nhellas at her first appearance in the dawn of history   e  g   athens  \\nargos   corinth   sicyon   and nearly every state with the exception of\\nsparta   through a similar stage of tyranny which ended either in\\noligarchy or democracy   but then we must remember that plato is\\ndescribing rather the contemporary governments of the sicilian states  \\nwhich alternated between democracy and tyranny   than the ancient\\nhistory of athens or corinth  \\n\\nthe portrait of the tyrant himself is just such as the later greek\\ndelighted to draw of phalaris and dionysius   in which   as in the lives\\nof mediaeval saints or mythic heroes   the conduct and actions of one\\nwere attributed to another in order to fill up the outline   there was\\nno enormity which the greek was not today to believe of them   the\\ntyrant was the negation of government and law   his assassination was\\nglorious   there was no crime   however unnatural   which might not with\\nprobability be attributed to him   in this   plato was only following the\\ncommon thought of his countrymen   which he embellished and exaggerated\\nwith all the power of his genius   there is no need to suppose that he\\ndrew from life   or that his knowledge of tyrants is derived from a\\npersonal acquaintance with dionysius   the manner in which he speaks of\\nthem would rather tend to render doubtful his ever having   consorted  \\nwith them   or entertained the schemes   which are attributed to him in\\nthe epistles   of regenerating sicily by their help  \\n\\nplato in a hyperbolical and serio  comic vein exaggerates the follies of\\ndemocracy which he also sees reflected in social life   to him democracy\\nis a state of individualism or dissolution   in which every one is doing\\nwhat is right in his own eyes   of a people animated by a common spirit\\nof liberty   rising as one man to repel the persian host   which is the\\nleading idea of democracy in herodotus and thucydides   he never seems\\nto think   but if he is not a believer in liberty   still less is he a\\nlover of tyranny   his deeper and more serious condemnation is reserved\\nfor the tyrant   who is the ideal of wickedness and also of weakness  \\nand who in his utter helplessness and suspiciousness is leading an\\nalmost impossible existence   without that remnant of good which   in\\nplato  s opinion   was required to give power to evil   book i     this\\nideal of wickedness living in helpless misery   is the reverse of that\\nother portrait of perfect injustice ruling in happiness and splendour  \\nwhich first of all thrasymachus   and afterwards the sons of ariston had\\ndrawn   and is also the reverse of the king whose rule of life is the\\ngood of his subjects  \\n\\neach of these governments and individuals has a corresponding ethical\\ngradation   the ideal state is under the rule of reason   not\\nextinguishing but harmonizing the passions   and training them in\\nvirtue   in the timocracy and the timocratic man the constitution  \\nwhether of the state or of the individual   is based   first   upon\\ncourage   and secondly   upon the love of honour   this latter virtue  \\nwhich is hardly to be esteemed a virtue   has superseded all the rest  \\nin the second stage of decline the virtues have altogether disappeared  \\nand the love of gain has succeeded to them   in the third stage   or\\ndemocracy   the various passions are allowed to have free play   and the\\nvirtues and vices are impartially cultivated   but this freedom   which\\nleads to many curious extravagances of character   is in reality only a\\nstate of weakness and dissipation   at last   one monster passion takes\\npossession of the whole nature of man—this is tyranny   in all of them\\nexcess—the excess first of wealth and then of freedom   is the element\\nof decay  \\n\\nthe eighth book of the republic abounds in pictures of life and\\nfanciful allusions   the use of metaphorical language is carried to a\\ngreater extent than anywhere else in plato   we may remark  \\n\\n  1     the description of the two nations in one   which become more and\\nmore divided in the greek republics   as in feudal times   and perhaps\\nalso in our own  \\n\\n  2     the notion of democracy expressed in a sort of pythagorean formula\\nas equality among unequals  \\n\\n  3     the free and easy ways of men and animals   which are\\ncharacteristic of liberty   as foreign mercenaries and universal\\nmistrust are of the tyrant  \\n\\n  4     the proposal that mere debts should not be recoverable by law is a\\nspeculation which has often been entertained by reformers of the law in\\nmodern times   and is in harmony with the tendencies of modern\\nlegislation   debt and land were the two great difficulties of the\\nancient lawgiver   in modern times we may be said to have almost   if not\\nquite   solved the first of these difficulties   but hardly the second  \\n\\nstill more remarkable are the corresponding portraits of individuals  \\nthere is the family picture of the father and mother and the old\\nservant of the timocratical man   and the outward respectability and\\ninherent meanness of the oligarchical   the uncontrolled licence and\\nfreedom of the democrat   in which the young alcibiades seems to be\\ndepicted   doing right or wrong as he pleases   and who at last   like the\\nprodigal   goes into a far country   note here the play of language by\\nwhich the democratic man is himself represented under the image of a\\nstate having a citadel and receiving embassies     and there is the\\nwild  beast nature   which breaks loose in his successor   the hit about\\nthe tyrant being a parricide   the representation of the tyrant  s life\\nas an obscene dream   the rhetorical surprise of a more miserable than\\nthe most miserable of men in book ix   the hint to the poets that if\\nthey are the friends of tyrants there is no place for them in a\\nconstitutional state   and that they are too clever not to see the\\npropriety of their own expulsion   the continuous image of the drones\\nwho are of two kinds   swelling at last into the monster drone having\\nwings   book ix    —are among plato  s happiest touches  \\n\\nthere remains to be considered the great difficulty of this book of the\\nrepublic   the so  called number of the state   this is a puzzle almost as\\ngreat as the number of the beast in the book of revelation   and though\\napparently known to aristotle   is referred to by cicero as a proverb of\\nobscurity   ep   ad att       and some have imagined that there is no answer\\nto the puzzle   and that plato has been practising upon his readers   but\\nsuch a deception as this is inconsistent with the manner in which\\naristotle speaks of the number   pol       and would have been ridiculous\\nto any reader of the republic who was acquainted with greek\\nmathematics   as little reason is there for supposing that plato\\nintentionally used obscure expressions   the obscurity arises from our\\nwant of familiarity with the subject   on the other hand   plato himself\\nindicates that he is not altogether serious   and in describing his\\nnumber as a solemn jest of the muses   he appears to imply some degree\\nof satire on the symbolical use of number     compare cratylus   protag    \\n\\nour hope of understanding the passage depends principally on an\\naccurate study of the words themselves   on which a faint light is\\nthrown by the parallel passage in the ninth book   another help is the\\nallusion in aristotle   who makes the important remark that the latter\\npart of the passage   greek   describes a solid figure     pol  —  he only\\nsays that nothing is abiding   but that all things change in a certain\\ncycle   and that the origin of the change is a base of numbers which are\\nin the ratio of 4  3   and this when combined with a figure of five gives\\ntwo harmonies   he means when the number of this figure becomes solid      \\nsome further clue may be gathered from the appearance of the\\npythagorean triangle   which is denoted by the numbers 3   4   5   and in\\nwhich   as in every right  angled triangle   the squares of the two lesser\\nsides equal the square of the hypotenuse   9 + 16 = 25    \\n\\nplato begins by speaking of a perfect or cyclical number   tim       i  e   a\\nnumber in which the sum of the divisors equals the whole   this is the\\ndivine or perfect number in which all lesser cycles or revolutions are\\ncomplete   he also speaks of a human or imperfect number   having four\\nterms and three intervals of numbers which are related to one another\\nin certain proportions   these he converts into figures   and finds in\\nthem when they have been raised to the third power certain elements of\\nnumber   which give two   harmonies     the one square   the other oblong  \\nbut he does not say that the square number answers to the divine   or\\nthe oblong number to the human cycle   nor is any intimation given that\\nthe first or divine number represents the period of the world   the\\nsecond the period of the state   or of the human race as zeller\\nsupposes   nor is the divine number afterwards mentioned   arist       the\\nsecond is the number of generations or births   and presides over them\\nin the same mysterious manner in which the stars preside over them   or\\nin which   according to the pythagoreans   opportunity   justice  \\nmarriage   are represented by some number or figure   this is probably\\nthe number 216  \\n\\nthe explanation given in the text supposes the two harmonies to make up\\nthe number 8000   this explanation derives a certain plausibility from\\nthe circumstance that 8000 is the ancient number of the spartan\\ncitizens   herod       and would be what plato might have called   a number\\nwhich nearly concerns the population of a city     the mysterious\\ndisappearance of the spartan population may possibly have suggested to\\nhim the first cause of his decline of states   the lesser or square\\n  harmony     of 400   might be a symbol of the guardians  —the larger or\\noblong   harmony     of the people   and the numbers 3   4   5 might refer\\nrespectively to the three orders in the state or parts of the soul   the\\nfour virtues   the five forms of government   the harmony of the musical\\nscale   which is elsewhere used as a symbol of the harmony of the state  \\nis also indicated   for the numbers 3   4   5   which represent the sides\\nof the pythagorean triangle   also denote the intervals of the scale  \\n\\nthe terms used in the statement of the problem may be explained as\\nfollows   a perfect number   greek     as already stated   is one which is\\nequal to the sum of its divisors   thus 6   which is the first perfect or\\ncyclical number   = 1 + 2 + 3   the words   greek       terms   or   notes    \\nand   greek       intervals     are applicable to music as well as to number\\nand figure     greek   is the   base   on which the whole calculation\\ndepends   or the   lowest term   from which it can be worked out   the\\nwords   greek   have been variously translated—  squared and cubed  \\n  donaldson       equalling and equalled

ways of describing the same relation   with more or less\\nprecision   they are equivalent to   expressible in terms having the same\\nrelation to one another     like the series 8   12   18   27

platonic number by\\ndr   donaldson   proc   of the philol   society    \\n\\nthe conclusions which he draws from these data are summed up by him as\\nfollows   having assumed that the number of the perfect or divine cycle\\nis the number of the world   and the number of the imperfect cycle the\\nnumber of the state   he proceeds     the period of the world is defined\\nby the perfect number 6   that of the state by the cube of that number\\nor 216   which is the product of the last pair of terms in the platonic\\ntetractys   a series of seven terms   1   2   3   4   9   8   27     and if we\\ntake this as the basis of our computation   we shall have two cube\\nnumbers   greek     viz   8 and 27   and the mean proportionals between\\nthese   viz   12 and 18   will furnish three intervals and four terms   and\\nthese terms and intervals stand related to one another in the\\nsesqui  altera ratio   i  e   each term is to the preceding as 3  2   now if\\nwe remember that the number 216 = 8 x 27 = 3 cubed + 4 cubed + 5 cubed  \\nand 3 squared + 4 squared = 5 squared   we must admit that this number\\nimplies the numbers 3   4   5   to which musicians attach so much\\nimportance   and if we combine the ratio 4  3 with the number 5   or\\nmultiply the ratios of the sides by the hypotenuse   we shall by first\\nsquaring and then cubing obtain two expressions   which denote the ratio\\nof the two last pairs of terms in the platonic tetractys   the former\\nmultiplied by the square   the latter by the cube of the number 10   the\\nsum of the first four digits which constitute the platonic tetractys    \\nthe two   greek   he elsewhere explains as follows     the first   greek   is\\n  greek     in other words   4  3 x 5   all squared = 100 x 2 squared over 3\\nsquared   the second   greek     a cube of the same root   is described as\\n100 multiplied   alpha   by the rational diameter of 5 diminished by\\nunity   i  e     as shown above   48     beta   by two incommensurable\\ndiameters   i  e   the two first irrationals   or 2 and 3   and   gamma   by\\nthe cube of 3   or 27   thus we have   48 + 5 + 27   100 = 1000 x 2 cubed  \\nthis second harmony is to be the cube of the number of which the former\\nharmony is the square   and therefore must be divided by the cube of 3  \\nin other words   the whole expression will be     1     for the first\\nharmony   400  9     2     for the second harmony   8000  27    \\n\\nthe reasons which have inclined me to agree with dr   donaldson and also\\nwith schleiermacher in supposing that 216 is the platonic number of\\nbirths are     1   that it coincides with the description of the number\\ngiven in the first part of the passage   greek             2   that the number\\n216 with its permutations would have been familiar to a greek\\nmathematician   though unfamiliar to us     3   that 216 is the cube of 6  \\nand also the sum of 3 cubed   4 cubed   5 cubed   the numbers 3   4   5\\nrepresenting the pythagorean triangle   of which the sides when squared\\nequal the square of the hypotenuse   9 + 16 = 25       4   that it is also\\nthe period of the pythagorean metempsychosis     5   the three ultimate\\nterms or bases   3   4   5   of which 216 is composed answer to the third  \\nfourth   fifth in the musical scale     6   that the number 216 is the\\nproduct of the cubes of 2 and 3   which are the two last terms in the\\nplatonic tetractys     7   that the pythagorean triangle is said by\\nplutarch   de is   et osir       proclus   super prima eucl       and quintilian\\n  de musica   to be contained in this passage   so that the tradition of\\nthe school seems to point in the same direction     8   that the\\npythagorean triangle is called also the figure of marriage   greek    \\n\\nbut though agreeing with dr   donaldson thus far   i see no reason for\\nsupposing   as he does   that the first or perfect number is the world  \\nthe human or imperfect number the state   nor has he given any proof\\nthat the second harmony is a cube   nor do i think that   greek   can mean\\n  two incommensurables     which he arbitrarily assumes to be 2 and 3   but\\nrather   as the preceding clause implies     greek     i  e   two square\\nnumbers based upon irrational diameters of a figure the side of which\\nis 5 = 50 x 2  \\n\\nthe greatest objection to the translation is the sense given to the\\nwords   greek       a base of three with a third added to it   multiplied by\\n5     in this somewhat forced manner plato introduces once more the\\nnumbers of the pythagorean triangle   but the coincidences in the\\nnumbers which follow are in favour of the explanation   the first\\nharmony of 400   as has been already remarked   probably represents the\\nrulers   the second and oblong harmony of 7600   the people  \\n\\nand here we take leave of the difficulty   the discovery of the riddle\\nwould be useless   and would throw no light on ancient mathematics   the\\npoint of interest is that plato should have used such a symbol   and\\nthat so much of the pythagorean spirit should have prevailed in him  \\nhis general meaning is that divine creation is perfect   and is\\nrepresented or presided over by a perfect or cyclical number   human\\ngeneration is imperfect   and represented or presided over by an\\nimperfect number or series of numbers   the number 5040   which is the\\nnumber of the citizens in the laws   is expressly based by him on\\nutilitarian grounds   namely   the convenience of the number for\\ndivision   it is also made up of the first seven digits multiplied by\\none another   the contrast of the perfect and imperfect number may have\\nbeen easily suggested by the corrections of the cycle   which were made\\nfirst by meton and secondly by callippus     the latter is said to have\\nbeen a pupil of plato     of the degree of importance or of exactness to\\nbe attributed to the problem   the number of the tyrant in book ix   729\\n= 365 x 2     and the slight correction of the error in the number\\n5040  12   laws     may furnish a criterion   there is nothing surprising in\\nthe circumstance that those who were seeking for order in nature and\\nhad found order in number   should have imagined one to give law to the\\nother   plato believes in a power of number far beyond what he could see\\nrealized in the world around him   and he knows the great influence\\nwhich   the little matter of 1   2   3   exercises upon education   he may\\neven be thought to have a prophetic anticipation of the discoveries of\\nquetelet and others   that numbers depend upon numbers   e  g  —in\\npopulation   the numbers of births and the respective numbers of\\nchildren born of either sex   on the respective ages of parents   i  e   on\\nother numbers  \\n\\nbook ix   last of all comes the tyrannical man   about whom we have to\\nenquire   whence is he   and how does he live—in

irregular and abnormal   even in good men there is such an\\nirregular wild  beast nature   which peers out in sleep  \\n\\nto return  —you remember what was said of the democrat   that he was

his father  s\\nnarrow ways   and being a better man than the corrupters of his youth  \\nhe came to a mean   and led a life   not of lawless or slavish passion  \\nbut of regular and successive indulgence   now imagine that the youth\\nhas become a father   and has a son who is exposed to the same\\ntemptations   and has companions who lead him into every sort of\\niniquity   and parents and friends who try to keep him right   the\\ncounsellors of evil find that their only chance of retaining him is to\\nimplant in his soul a monster drone   or love   while other desires buzz\\naround him and mystify him with sweet sounds and scents   this monster\\nlove takes possession of him   and puts an end to every true or modest\\nthought or wish   love   like drunkenness and madness   is a tyranny   and\\nthe tyrannical man   whether made by nature or habit   is just a\\ndrinking   lusting   furious sort of animal  \\n\\nand how does such an one live     nay   that you must tell me     well then  \\ni fancy that he will live amid revelries and harlotries   and love will\\nbe the lord and master of the house   many desires require much money  \\nand so he spends all that he has and borrows more   and when he has\\nnothing the young ravens are still in the nest in which they were\\nhatched   crying for food   love urges them on   and they must be\\ngratified by force or fraud   or if not   they become painful and\\ntroublesome   and as the new pleasures succeed the old ones   so will the\\nson take possession of the goods of his parents   if they show signs of\\nrefusing   he will defraud and deceive them   and if they openly resist  \\nwhat then     i can only say   that i should not much like to be in their\\nplace     but   o heavens   adeimantus   to think that for some new  fangled\\nand unnecessary love he will give up his old father and mother   best\\nand dearest of friends   or enslave them to the fancies of the hour  \\ntruly a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother   when\\nthere is no more to be got out of them   he turns burglar or pickpocket  \\nor robs a temple   love overmasters the thoughts of his youth   and he\\nbecomes in sober reality the monster that he was sometimes in sleep   he\\nwaxes strong in all violence and lawlessness   and is ready for any deed\\nof daring that will supply the wants of his rabble  rout   in a\\nwell  ordered state there are only a few such   and these in time of war\\ngo out and become the mercenaries of a tyrant   but in time of peace\\nthey stay at home and do mischief   they are the thieves   footpads  \\ncut  purses   man  stealers of the community   or if they are able to\\nspeak   they turn false  witnesses and informers     no small catalogue of\\ncrimes truly   even if the perpetrators are few     yes   i said   but small\\nand great are relative terms   and no crimes which are committed by them\\napproach those of the tyrant   whom this class   growing strong and\\nnumerous   create out of themselves   if the people yield   well and good  \\nbut   if they resist   then   as before he beat his father and mother   so\\nnow he beats his fatherland and motherland   and places his mercenaries\\nover them   such men in their early days live with flatterers   and they\\nthemselves flatter others   in order to gain their ends   but they soon\\ndiscard their followers when they have no longer any need of them   they\\nare always either masters or servants  —the joys of friendship are\\nunknown to them   and they are utterly treacherous and unjust   if the\\nnature of justice be at all understood by us   they realize our dream  \\nand he who is the most of a tyrant by nature   and leads the life of a\\ntyrant for the longest time   will be the worst of them   and being the\\nworst of them   will also be the most miserable  \\n\\nlike man   like state  —the tyrannical man will answer to tyranny   which\\nis the extreme opposite of the royal state   for one is the best and the\\nother the worst   but which is the happier   great and terrible as the\\ntyrant may appear enthroned amid his satellites   let us not be afraid\\nto go in and ask   and the answer is   that the monarchical is the\\nhappiest   and the tyrannical the most miserable of states   and may we\\nnot ask the same question about the men themselves   requesting some one\\nto look into them who is able to penetrate the inner nature of man   and\\nwill not be panic  struck by the vain pomp of tyranny   i will suppose\\nthat he is one who has lived with him   and has seen him in family life  \\nor perhaps in the hour of trouble and danger  \\n\\nassuming that we ourselves are the impartial judge for whom we seek  \\nlet us begin by comparing the individual and state   and ask first of\\nall   whether the state is likely to be free or enslaved—will there not\\nbe a little freedom and a great deal of slavery   and the freedom is of\\nthe bad   and the slavery of the good   and this applies to the man as\\nwell as to the state   for his soul is full of meanness and slavery   and\\nthe better part is enslaved to the worse   he cannot do what he would  \\nand his mind is full of confusion   he is the very reverse of a freeman  \\nthe state will be poor and full of misery and sorrow   and the man  s\\nsoul will also be poor and full of sorrows   and he will be the most\\nmiserable of men   no   not the most miserable   for there is yet a more\\nmiserable     who is that     the tyrannical man who has the misfortune\\nalso to become a public tyrant     there i suspect that you are right    \\nsay rather     i am sure     conjecture is out of place in an enquiry of\\nthis nature   he is like a wealthy owner of slaves   only he has more of\\nthem than any private individual   you will say     the owners of slaves\\nare not generally in any fear of them     but why   because the whole city\\nis in a league which protects the individual   suppose however that one\\nof these owners and his household is carried off by a god into a\\nwilderness   where there are no freemen to help him—will he not be in an\\nagony of terror  —will he not be compelled to flatter his slaves and to\\npromise them many things sore against his will   and suppose the same\\ngod who carried him off were to surround him with neighbours who\\ndeclare that no man ought to have slaves   and that the owners of them\\nshould be punished with death     still worse and worse   he will be in\\nthe midst of his enemies     and is not our tyrant such a captive soul  \\nwho is tormented by a swarm of passions which he cannot indulge   living\\nindoors always like a woman   and jealous of those who can go out and\\nsee the world  \\n\\nhaving so many evils   will not the most miserable of men be still more\\nmiserable in a public station   master of others when he is not master\\nof himself   like a sick man who is compelled to be an athlete   the\\nmeanest of slaves and the most abject of flatterers   wanting all\\nthings   and never able to satisfy his desires   always in fear and\\ndistraction   like the state of which he is the representative   his\\njealous   hateful   faithless temper grows worse with command   he is more\\nand more faithless   envious   unrighteous  —the most wretched of men   a\\nmisery to himself and to others   and so let us have a final trial and\\nproclamation   need we hire a herald   or shall i proclaim the result  \\n  made the proclamation yourself     the son of ariston   the best   is of\\nopinion that the best and justest of men is also the happiest   and that\\nthis is he who is the most royal master of himself   and that the unjust\\nman is he who is the greatest tyrant of himself and of his state   and i\\nadd further—  seen or unseen by gods or men    \\n\\nthis is our first proof   the second is derived from the three kinds of\\npleasure   which answer to the three elements of the soul—reason  \\npassion   desire   under which last is comprehended avarice as well as\\nsensual appetite   while passion includes ambition   party  feeling   love\\nof reputation   reason   again   is solely directed to the attainment of\\ntruth   and careless of money and reputation   in accordance with the\\ndifference of men  s natures   one of these three principles is in the\\nascendant   and they have their several pleasures corresponding to them  \\ninterrogate now the three natures   and each one will be found praising\\nhis own pleasures and depreciating those of others   the money  maker\\nwill contrast the vanity of knowledge with the solid advantages of\\nwealth   the ambitious man will despise knowledge which brings no\\nhonour   whereas the philosopher will regard only the fruition of truth  \\nand will call other pleasures necessary rather than good   now   how\\nshall we decide between them   is there any better criterion than\\nexperience and knowledge   and which of the three has the truest\\nknowledge and the widest experience   the experience of youth makes the\\nphilosopher acquainted with the two kinds of desire   but the avaricious\\nand the ambitious man never taste the pleasures of truth and wisdom  \\nhonour he has equally with them   they are   judged of him     but he is\\n  not judged of them     for they never attain to the knowledge of true\\nbeing   and his instrument is reason   whereas their standard is only\\nwealth and honour   and if by reason we are to judge   his good will be\\nthe truest   and so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the\\nrational part of the soul   and a life passed in such pleasure is the\\npleasantest   he who has a right to judge judges thus   next comes the\\nlife of ambition   and   in the third place   that of money  making  \\n\\ntwice has the just man overthrown the unjust—once more   as in an\\nolympian contest   first offering up a prayer to the saviour zeus   let\\nhim try a fall   a wise man whispers to me that the pleasures of the\\nwise are true and pure   all others are a shadow only   let us examine\\nthis   is not pleasure opposed to pain   and is there not a mean state\\nwhich is neither   when a man is sick   nothing is more pleasant to him\\nthan health   but this he never found out while he was well   in pain he\\ndesires only to cease from pain   on the other hand   when he is in an\\necstasy of pleasure   rest is painful to him   thus rest or cessation is\\nboth pleasure and pain   but can that which is neither become both  \\nagain   pleasure and pain are motions   and the absence of them is rest  \\nbut if so   how can the absence of either of them be the other   thus we\\nare led to infer that the contradiction is an appearance only   and\\nwitchery of the senses   and these are not the only pleasures   for there\\nare others which have no preceding pains   pure pleasure then is not the\\nabsence of pain   nor pure pain the absence of pleasure   although most\\nof the pleasures which reach the mind through the body are reliefs of\\npain   and have not only their reactions when they depart   but their\\nanticipations before they come   they can be best described in a simile  \\nthere is in nature an upper   lower   and middle region   and he who\\npasses from the lower to the middle imagines that he is going up and is\\nalready in the upper world   and if he were taken back again would\\nthink   and truly think   that he was descending   all this arises out of\\nhis ignorance of the true upper   middle   and lower regions   and a like\\nconfusion happens with pleasure and pain   and with many other things  \\nthe man who compares grey with black   calls grey white   and the man who\\ncompares absence of pain with pain   calls the absence of pain pleasure  \\nagain   hunger and thirst are inanitions of the body   ignorance and\\nfolly of the soul   and food is the satisfaction of the one   knowledge\\nof the other   now which is the purer satisfaction—that of eating and\\ndrinking   or that of knowledge   consider the matter thus   the\\nsatisfaction of that which has more existence is truer than of that\\nwhich has less   the invariable and immortal has a more real existence\\nthan the variable and mortal   and has a corresponding measure of\\nknowledge and truth   the soul   again   has more existence and truth and\\nknowledge than the body   and is therefore more really satisfied and has\\na more natural pleasure   those who feast only on earthly food   are\\nalways going at random up to the middle and down again   but they never\\npass into the true upper world   or have a taste of true pleasure   they\\nare like fatted beasts   full of gluttony and sensuality   and ready to\\nkill one another by reason of their insatiable lust   for they are not\\nfilled with true being   and their vessel is leaky   gorgias     their\\npleasures are mere shadows of pleasure   mixed with pain   coloured and\\nintensified by contrast   and therefore intensely desired   and men go\\nfighting about them   as stesichorus says that the greeks fought about\\nthe shadow of helen at troy   because they know not the truth  \\n\\nthe same may be said of the passionate element  —the desires of the\\nambitious soul   as well as of the covetous   have an inferior\\nsatisfaction   only when under the guidance of reason do either of the\\nother principles do their own business or attain the pleasure which is\\nnatural to them   when not attaining   they compel the other parts of the\\nsoul to pursue a shadow of pleasure which is not theirs   and the more\\ndistant they are from philosophy and reason   the more distant they will\\nbe from law and order   and the more illusive will be their pleasures  \\nthe desires of love and tyranny are the farthest from law   and those of\\nthe king are nearest to it   there is one genuine pleasure   and two\\nspurious ones   the tyrant goes beyond even the latter   he has run away\\naltogether from law and reason   nor can the measure of his inferiority\\nbe told   except in a figure   the tyrant is the third removed from the\\noligarch   and has therefore   not a shadow of his pleasure   but the\\nshadow of a shadow only   the oligarch   again   is thrice removed from\\nthe king   and thus we get the formula 3 x 3   which is the number of a\\nsurface   representing the shadow which is the tyrant  s pleasure   and if\\nyou like to cube this   number of the beast     you will find that the\\nmeasure of the difference amounts to 729   the king is 729 times more\\nhappy than the tyrant   and this extraordinary number is nearly equal to\\nthe number of days and nights in a year   365 x 2 = 730     and is\\ntherefore concerned with human life   this is the interval between a\\ngood and bad man in happiness only   what must be the difference between\\nthem in comeliness of life and virtue  \\n\\nperhaps you may remember some one saying at the beginning of our\\ndiscussion that the unjust man was profited if he had the reputation of\\njustice   now that we know the nature of justice and injustice   let us\\nmake an image of the soul   which will personify his words   first of\\nall   fashion a multitudinous beast   having a ring of heads of all\\nmanner of animals   tame and wild   and able to produce and change them\\nat pleasure   suppose now another form of a lion   and another of a man  \\nthe second smaller than the first   the third than the second   join them\\ntogether and cover them with a human skin   in which they are completely\\nconcealed   when this has been done   let us tell the supporter of\\ninjustice that he is feeding up the beasts and starving the man   the\\nmaintainer of justice   on the other hand   is trying to strengthen the\\nman   he is nourishing the gentle principle within him   and making an\\nalliance with the lion heart   in order that he may be able to keep down\\nthe many  headed hydra   and bring all into unity with each other and\\nwith themselves   thus in every point of view   whether in relation to\\npleasure   honour   or advantage   the just man is right   and the unjust\\nwrong  \\n\\nbut now   let us reason with the unjust   who is not intentionally in\\nerror   is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man   or\\nrather to the god in man   the ignoble   that which subjects the man to\\nthe beast   and if so   who would receive gold on condition that he was\\nto degrade the noblest part of himself under the worst  —who would sell\\nhis son or daughter into the hands of brutal and evil men   for any\\namount of money   and will he sell his own fairer and diviner part\\nwithout any compunction to the most godless and foul   would he not be\\nworse than eriphyle   who sold her husband  s life for a necklace   and\\nintemperance is the letting loose of the multiform monster   and pride\\nand sullenness are the growth and increase of the lion and serpent\\nelement   while luxury and effeminacy are caused by a too great\\nrelaxation of spirit   flattery and meanness again arise when the\\nspirited element is subjected to avarice   and the lion is habituated to\\nbecome a monkey   the real disgrace of handicraft arts is   that those\\nwho are engaged in them have to flatter   instead of mastering their\\ndesires   therefore we say that they should be placed under the control\\nof the better principle in another because they have none in\\nthemselves   not   as thrasymachus imagined   to the injury of the\\nsubjects   but for their good   and our intention in educating the young  \\nis to give them self  control   the law desires to nurse up in them a\\nhigher principle   and when they have acquired this   they may go their\\nways  \\n\\n  what   then   shall a man profit   if he gain the whole world   and become\\nmore and more wicked   or what shall he profit by escaping discovery   if\\nthe concealment of evil prevents the cure   if he had been punished   the\\nbrute within him would have been silenced   and the gentler element\\nliberated   and he would have united temperance   justice   and wisdom in\\nhis soul—a union better far than any combination of bodily gifts   the\\nman of understanding will honour knowledge above all   in the next place\\nhe will keep under his body   not only for the sake of health and\\nstrength   but in order to attain the most perfect harmony of body and\\nsoul   in the acquisition of riches   too   he will aim at order and\\nharmony   he will not desire to heap up wealth without measure   but he\\nwill fear that the increase of wealth will disturb the constitution of\\nhis own soul   for the same reason he will only accept such honours as\\nwill make him a better man   any others he will decline     in that case    \\nsaid he     he will never be a politician     yes   but he will   in his own\\ncity   though probably not in his native country   unless by some divine\\naccident     you mean that he will be a citizen of the ideal city   which\\nhas no place upon earth     but in heaven   i replied   there is a pattern\\nof such a city   and he who wishes may order his life after that image  \\nwhether such a state is or ever will be matters not   he will act\\naccording to that pattern and no other      \\n\\nthe most noticeable points in the 9th book of the republic are  —  1   the\\naccount of pleasure     2   the number of the interval which divides the\\nking from the tyrant     3   the pattern which is in heaven  \\n\\n1   plato  s account of pleasure is remarkable for moderation   and in\\nthis respect contrasts with the later platonists and the views which\\nare attributed to them by aristotle   he is not   like the cynics  \\nopposed to all pleasure   but rather desires that the several parts of\\nthe soul shall have their natural satisfaction   he even agrees with the\\nepicureans in describing pleasure as something more than the absence of\\npain   this is proved by the circumstance that there are pleasures which\\nhave no antecedent pains   as he also remarks in the philebus     such as\\nthe pleasures of smell   and also the pleasures of hope and\\nanticipation   in the previous book he had made the distinction between\\nnecessary and unnecessary pleasure   which is repeated by aristotle   and\\nhe now observes that there are a further class of   wild beast  \\npleasures   corresponding to aristotle  s   greek     he dwells upon the\\nrelative and unreal character of sensual pleasures and the illusion\\nwhich arises out of the contrast of pleasure and pain   pointing out the\\nsuperiority of the pleasures of reason   which are at rest   over the\\nfleeting pleasures of sense and emotion   the pre  eminence of royal\\npleasure is shown by the fact that reason is able to form a judgment of\\nthe lower pleasures   while the two lower parts of the soul are\\nincapable of judging the pleasures of reason   thus   in his treatment of\\npleasure   as in many other subjects   the philosophy of plato is   sawn\\nup into quantities   by aristotle   the analysis which was originally\\nmade by him became in the next generation the foundation of further\\ntechnical distinctions   both in plato and aristotle we note the\\nillusion under which the ancients fell of regarding the transience of\\npleasure as a proof of its unreality   and of confounding the permanence\\nof the intellectual pleasures with the unchangeableness of the\\nknowledge from which they are derived   neither do we like to admit that\\nthe pleasures of knowledge   though more elevating   are not more lasting\\nthan other pleasures   and are almost equally dependent on the accidents\\nof our bodily state   introduction to philebus    \\n\\n2   the number of the interval which separates the king from the tyrant  \\nand royal from tyrannical pleasures   is 729   the cube of 9   which plato\\ncharacteristically designates as a number concerned with human life  \\nbecause nearly equivalent to the number of days and nights in the year  \\nhe is desirous of proclaiming that the interval between them is\\nimmeasurable   and invents a formula to give expression to his idea  \\nthose who spoke of justice as a cube   of virtue as an art of measuring\\n  prot       saw no inappropriateness in conceiving the soul under the\\nfigure of a line   or the pleasure of the tyrant as separated from the\\npleasure of the king by the numerical interval of 729   and in modern\\ntimes we sometimes use metaphorically what plato employed as a\\nphilosophical formula     it is not easy to estimate the loss of the\\ntyrant   except perhaps in this way     says plato   so we might say   that\\nalthough the life of a good man is not to be compared to that of a bad\\nman   yet you may measure the difference between them by valuing one\\nminute of the one at an hour of the other     one day in thy courts is\\nbetter than a thousand       or you might say that   there is an infinite\\ndifference     but this is not so much as saying   in homely phrase     they\\nare a thousand miles asunder     and accordingly plato finds the natural\\nvehicle of his thoughts in a progression of numbers   this arithmetical\\nformula he draws out with the utmost seriousness   and both here and in\\nthe number of generation seems to find an additional proof of the truth\\nof his speculation in forming the number into a geometrical figure  \\njust as persons in our own day are apt to fancy that a statement is\\nverified when it has been only thrown into an abstract form   in\\nspeaking of the number 729 as proper to human life   he probably\\nintended to intimate that one year of the tyrannical = 12 hours of the\\nroyal life  \\n\\nthe simple observation that the comparison of two similar solids is\\neffected by the comparison of the cubes of their sides   is the\\nmathematical groundwork of this fanciful expression   there is some\\ndifficulty in explaining the steps by which the number 729 is obtained  \\nthe oligarch is removed in the third degree from the royal and\\naristocratical   and the tyrant in the third degree from the\\noligarchical   but we have to arrange the terms as the sides of a square\\nand to count the oligarch twice over   thus reckoning them not as = 5\\nbut as = 9   the square of 9 is passed lightly over as only a step\\ntowards the cube  \\n\\n3   towards the close of the republic   plato seems to be more and more\\nconvinced of the ideal character of his own speculations   at the end of\\nthe 9th book the pattern which is in heaven takes the place of the city\\nof philosophers on earth   the vision which has received form and\\nsubstance at his hands   is now discovered to be at a distance   and yet\\nthis distant kingdom is also the rule of man  s life       say not lo  \\nhere   or lo   there   for the kingdom of god is within you       thus a note\\nis struck which prepares for the revelation of a future life in the\\nfollowing book   but the future life is present still   the ideal of\\npolitics is to be realized in the individual  \\n\\nbook x   many things pleased me in the order of our state   but there was\\nnothing which i liked better than the regulation about poetry   the\\ndivision of the soul throws a new light on our exclusion of imitation  \\ni do not mind telling you in confidence that all poetry is an outrage\\non the understanding   unless the hearers have that balm of knowledge\\nwhich heals error   i have loved homer ever since i was a boy   and even\\nnow he appears to me to be the great master of tragic poetry   but much\\nas i love the man   i love truth more   and therefore i must speak out  \\nand first of all   will you explain what is imitation   for really i do\\nnot understand     how likely then that i should understand     that might\\nvery well be   for the duller often sees better than the keener eye  \\n  true   but in your presence i can hardly venture to say what i think    \\nthen suppose that we begin in our old fashion   with the doctrine of\\nuniversals   let us assume the existence of beds and tables   there is\\none idea of a bed   or of a table   which the maker of each had in his\\nmind when making them   he did not make the ideas of beds and tables  \\nbut he made beds and tables according to the ideas   and is there not a\\nmaker of the works of all workmen   who makes not only vessels but\\nplants and animals   himself   the earth and heaven   and things in heaven\\nand under the earth   he makes the gods also     he must be a wizard\\nindeed     but do you not see that there is a sense in which you could do\\nthe same   you have only to take a mirror   and catch the reflection of\\nthe sun   and the earth   or anything else—there now you have made them  \\n  yes   but only in appearance     exactly so   and the painter is such a\\ncreator as you are with the mirror   and he is even more unreal than the\\ncarpenter   although neither the carpenter nor any other artist can be\\nsupposed to make the absolute bed     not if philosophers may be\\nbelieved     nor need we wonder that his bed has but an imperfect\\nrelation to the truth   reflect  —here are three beds   one in nature  \\nwhich is made by god   another   which is made by the carpenter   and the\\nthird   by the painter   god only made one   nor could he have made more\\nthan one   for if there had been two   there would always have been a\\nthird—more absolute and abstract than either   under which they would\\nhave been included   we may therefore conceive god to be the natural\\nmaker of the bed   and in a lower sense the carpenter is also the maker  \\nbut the painter is rather the imitator of what the other two make   he\\nhas to do with a creation which is thrice removed from reality   and the\\ntragic poet is an imitator   and   like every other imitator   is thrice\\nremoved from the king and from the truth   the painter imitates not the\\noriginal bed   but the bed made by the carpenter   and this   without\\nbeing really different   appears to be different   and has many points of\\nview   of which only one is caught by the painter   who represents\\neverything because he represents a piece of everything   and that piece\\nan image   and he can paint any other artist   although he knows nothing\\nof their arts   and this with sufficient skill to deceive children or\\nsimple people   suppose now that somebody came to us and told us   how he\\nhad met a man who knew all that everybody knows   and better than\\nanybody  —should we not infer him to be a simpleton who   having no\\ndiscernment of truth and falsehood   had met with a wizard or enchanter  \\nwhom he fancied to be all  wise   and when we hear persons saying that\\nhomer and the tragedians know all the arts and all the virtues   must we\\nnot infer that they are under a similar delusion   they do not see that\\nthe poets are imitators   and that their creations are only imitations  \\n  very true     but if a person could create as well as imitate   he would\\nrather leave some permanent work and not an imitation only   he would\\nrather be the receiver than the giver of praise     yes   for then he\\nwould have more honour and advantage    \\n\\nlet us now interrogate homer and the poets   friend homer   say i to him  \\ni am not going to ask you about medicine   or any art to which your\\npoems incidentally refer   but about their main subjects—war   military\\ntactics   politics   if you are only twice and not thrice removed from\\nthe truth—not an imitator or an image  maker   please to inform us what\\ngood you have ever done to mankind   is there any city which professes\\nto have received laws from you   as sicily and italy have from\\ncharondas   sparta from lycurgus   athens from solon   or was any war ever\\ncarried on by your counsels   or is any invention attributed to you   as\\nthere is to thales and anacharsis   or is there any homeric way of life  \\nsuch as the pythagorean was   in which you instructed men   and which is\\ncalled after you     no   indeed   and creophylus   flesh  child   was even\\nmore unfortunate in his breeding than he was in his name   if   as\\ntradition says   homer in his lifetime was allowed by him and his other\\nfriends to starve     yes   but could this ever have happened if homer had\\nreally been the educator of hellas   would he not have had many devoted\\nfollowers   if protagoras and prodicus can persuade their contemporaries\\nthat no one can manage house or state without them   is it likely that\\nhomer and hesiod would have been allowed to go about as beggars—i mean\\nif they had really been able to do the world any good  —would not men\\nhave compelled them to stay where they were   or have followed them\\nabout in order to get education   but they did not   and therefore we may\\ninfer that homer and all the poets are only imitators   who do but\\nimitate the appearances of things   for as a painter by a knowledge of\\nfigure and colour can paint a cobbler without any practice in cobbling  \\nso the poet can delineate any art in the colours of language   and give\\nharmony and rhythm to the cobbler and also to the general   and you know\\nhow mere narration   when deprived of the ornaments of metre   is like a\\nface which has lost the beauty of youth and never had any other   once\\nmore   the imitator has no knowledge of reality   but only of appearance  \\nthe painter paints   and the artificer makes a bridle and reins   but\\nneither understands the use of them—the knowledge of this is confined\\nto the horseman   and so of other things   thus we have three arts   one\\nof use   another of invention   a third of imitation   and the user\\nfurnishes the rule to the two others   the flute  player will know the\\ngood and bad flute   and the maker will put faith in him   but the\\nimitator will neither know nor have faith—neither science nor true\\nopinion can be ascribed to him   imitation   then   is devoid of\\nknowledge   being only a kind of play or sport   and the tragic and epic\\npoets are imitators in the highest degree  \\n\\nand now let us enquire   what is the faculty in man which answers to\\nimitation   allow me to explain my meaning   objects are differently seen\\nwhen in the water and when out of the water   when near and when at a\\ndistance   and the painter or juggler makes use of this variation to\\nimpose upon us   and the art of measuring and weighing and calculating\\ncomes in to save our bewildered minds from the power of appearance  \\nfor   as we were saying   two contrary opinions of the same about the\\nsame and at the same time   cannot both of them be true   but which of\\nthem is true is determined by the art of calculation   and this is\\nallied to the better faculty in the soul   as the arts of imitation are\\nto the worse   and the same holds of the ear as well as of the eye   of\\npoetry as well as painting   the imitation is of actions voluntary or\\ninvoluntary   in which there is an expectation of a good or bad result  \\nand present experience of pleasure and pain   but is a man in harmony\\nwith himself when he is the subject of these conflicting influences   is\\nthere not rather a contradiction in him   let me further ask   whether he\\nis more likely to control sorrow when he is alone or when he is in\\ncompany     in the latter case     feeling would lead him to indulge his\\nsorrow   but reason and law control him and enjoin patience   since he\\ncannot know whether his affliction is good or evil   and no human thing\\nis of any great consequence   while sorrow is certainly a hindrance to\\ngood counsel   for when we stumble   we should not   like children   make\\nan uproar   we should take the measures which reason prescribes   not\\nraising a lament   but finding a cure   and the better part of us is\\nready to follow reason   while the irrational principle is full of\\nsorrow and distraction at the recollection of our troubles  \\nunfortunately   however   this latter furnishes the chief materials of\\nthe imitative arts   whereas reason is ever in repose and cannot easily\\nbe displayed   especially to a mixed multitude who have no experience of\\nher   thus the poet is like the painter in two ways   first he paints an\\ninferior degree of truth   and secondly   he is concerned with an\\ninferior part of the soul   he indulges the feelings   while he enfeebles\\nthe reason   and we refuse to allow him to have authority over the mind\\nof man   for he has no measure of greater and less   and is a maker of\\nimages and very far gone from truth  \\n\\nbut we have not yet mentioned the heaviest count in the indictment—the\\npower which poetry has of injuriously exciting the feelings   when we\\nhear some passage in which a hero laments his sufferings at tedious\\nlength   you know that we sympathize with him and praise the poet   and\\nyet in our own sorrows such an exhibition of feeling is regarded as\\neffeminate and unmanly   ion     now   ought a man to feel pleasure in\\nseeing another do what he hates and abominates in himself   is he not\\ngiving way to a sentiment which in his own case he would control  —he is\\noff his guard because the sorrow is another  s   and he thinks that he\\nmay indulge his feelings without disgrace   and will be the gainer by\\nthe pleasure   but the inevitable consequence is that he who begins by\\nweeping at the sorrows of others   will end by weeping at his own   the\\nsame is true of comedy  —you may often laugh at buffoonery which you\\nwould be ashamed to utter   and the love of coarse merriment on the\\nstage will at last turn you into a buffoon at home   poetry feeds and\\nwaters the passions and desires   she lets them rule instead of ruling\\nthem   and therefore   when we hear the encomiasts of homer affirming\\nthat he is the educator of hellas   and that all life should be\\nregulated by his precepts   we may allow the excellence of their\\nintentions   and agree with them in thinking homer a great poet and\\ntragedian   but we shall continue to prohibit all poetry which goes\\nbeyond hymns to the gods and praises of famous men   not pleasure and\\npain   but law and reason shall rule in our state  \\n\\nthese are our grounds for expelling poetry   but lest she should charge\\nus with discourtesy   let us also make an apology to her   we will remind\\nher that there is an ancient quarrel between poetry and philosophy   of\\nwhich there are many traces in the writings of the poets   such as the\\nsaying of   the she  dog   yelping at her mistress     and   the philosophers\\nwho are ready to circumvent zeus     and   the philosophers who are\\npaupers     nevertheless we bear her no ill  will   and will gladly allow\\nher to return upon condition that she makes a defence of herself in\\nverse   and her supporters who are not poets may speak in prose   we\\nconfess her charms   but if she cannot show that she is useful as well\\nas delightful   like rational lovers   we must renounce our love   though\\nendeared to us by early associations   having come to years of\\ndiscretion   we know that poetry is not truth   and that a man should be\\ncareful how he introduces her to that state or constitution which he\\nhimself is   for there is a mighty issue at stake—no less than the good\\nor evil of a human soul   and it is not worth while to forsake justice\\nand virtue for the attractions of poetry   any more than for the sake of\\nhonour or wealth     i agree with you    \\n\\nand yet the rewards of virtue are greater far than i have described  \\n  and can we conceive things greater still     not   perhaps   in this brief\\nspan of life   but should an immortal being care about anything short of\\neternity     i do not understand what you mean     do you not know that the\\nsoul is immortal     surely you are not prepared to prove that     indeed i\\nam     then let me hear this argument   of which you make so light    \\n\\nyou would admit that everything has an element of good and of evil   in\\nall things there is an inherent corruption   and if this cannot destroy\\nthem   nothing else will   the soul too has her own corrupting\\nprinciples   which are injustice   intemperance   cowardice   and the like  \\nbut none of these destroy the soul in the same sense that disease\\ndestroys the body   the soul may be full of all iniquities   but is not  \\nby reason of them   brought any nearer to death   nothing which was not\\ndestroyed from within ever perished by external affection of evil   the\\nbody   which is one thing   cannot be destroyed by food   which is\\nanother   unless the badness of the food is communicated to the body  \\nneither can the soul   which is one thing   be corrupted by the body  \\nwhich is another   unless she herself is infected   and as no bodily evil\\ncan infect the soul   neither can any bodily evil   whether disease or\\nviolence   or any other destroy the soul   unless it can be shown to\\nrender her unholy and unjust   but no one will ever prove that the souls\\nof men become more unjust when they die   if a person has the audacity\\nto say the contrary   the answer is—then why do criminals require the\\nhand of the executioner   and not die of themselves     truly     he said  \\n  injustice would not be very terrible if it brought a cessation of\\nevil   but i rather believe that the injustice which murders others may\\ntend to quicken and stimulate the life of the unjust     you are quite\\nright   if sin which is her own natural and inherent evil cannot destroy\\nthe soul   hardly will anything else destroy her   but the soul which\\ncannot be destroyed either by internal or external evil must be\\nimmortal and everlasting   and if this be true   souls will always exist\\nin the same number   they cannot diminish   because they cannot be\\ndestroyed   nor yet increase   for the increase of the immortal must come\\nfrom something mortal   and so all would end in immortality   neither is\\nthe soul variable and diverse   for that which is immortal must be of\\nthe fairest and simplest composition   if we would conceive her truly  \\nand so behold justice and injustice in their own nature   she must be\\nviewed by the light of reason pure as at birth   or as she is reflected\\nin philosophy when holding converse with the divine and immortal and\\neternal   in her present condition we see her only like the sea  god\\nglaucus   bruised and maimed in the sea which is the world   and covered\\nwith shells and stones which are incrusted upon her from the\\nentertainments of earth  \\n\\nthus far   as the argument required   we have said nothing of the rewards\\nand honours which the poets attribute to justice   we have contented\\nourselves with showing that justice in herself is best for the soul in\\nherself   even if a man should put on a gyges   ring and have the helmet\\nof hades too   and now you shall repay me what you borrowed   and i will\\nenumerate the rewards of justice in life and after death   i granted  \\nfor the sake of argument   as you will remember   that evil might perhaps\\nescape the knowledge of gods and men   although this was really\\nimpossible   and since i have shown that justice has reality   you must\\ngrant me also that she has the palm of appearance   in the first place  \\nthe just man is known to the gods   and he is therefore the friend of\\nthe gods   and he will receive at their hands every good   always\\nexcepting such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins   all\\nthings end in good to him   either in life or after death   even what\\nappears to be evil   for the gods have a care of him who desires to be\\nin their likeness   and what shall we say of men   is not honesty the\\nbest policy   the clever rogue makes a great start at first   but breaks\\ndown before he reaches the goal   and slinks away in dishonour   whereas\\nthe true runner perseveres to the end   and receives the prize   and you\\nmust allow me to repeat all the blessings which you attributed to the\\nfortunate unjust—they bear rule in the city   they marry and give in\\nmarriage to whom they will   and the evils which you attributed to the\\nunfortunate just   do really fall in the end on the unjust   although   as\\nyou implied   their sufferings are better veiled in silence  \\n\\nbut all the blessings of this present life are as nothing when compared\\nwith those which await good men after death     i should like to hear\\nabout them     come   then   and i will tell you the story of er   the son\\nof armenius   a valiant man   he was supposed to have died in battle   but\\nten days afterwards his body was found untouched by corruption and sent\\nhome for burial   on the twelfth day he was placed on the funeral pyre\\nand there he came to life again   and told what he had seen in the world\\nbelow   he said that his soul went with a great company to a place   in\\nwhich there were two chasms near together in the earth beneath   and two\\ncorresponding chasms in the heaven above   and there were judges sitting\\nin the intermediate space   bidding the just ascend by the heavenly way\\non the right hand   having the seal of their judgment set upon them\\nbefore   while the unjust   having the seal behind   were bidden to\\ndescend by the way on the left hand   him they told to look and listen  \\nas he was to be their messenger to men from the world below   and he\\nbeheld and saw the souls departing after judgment at either chasm   some\\nwho came from earth   were worn and travel  stained   others   who came\\nfrom heaven   were clean and bright   they seemed glad to meet and rest\\nawhile in the meadow   here they discoursed with one another of what\\nthey had seen in the other world   those who came from earth wept at the\\nremembrance of their sorrows   but the spirits from above spoke of\\nglorious sights and heavenly bliss   he said that for every evil deed\\nthey were punished tenfold—now the journey was of a thousand years  \\nduration   because the life of man was reckoned as a hundred years—and\\nthe rewards of virtue were in the same proportion   he added something\\nhardly worth repeating about infants dying almost as soon as they were\\nborn   of parricides and other murderers he had tortures still more\\nterrible to narrate   he was present when one of the spirits asked—where\\nis ardiaeus the great     this ardiaeus was a cruel tyrant   who had\\nmurdered his father   and his elder brother   a thousand years before    \\nanother spirit answered     he comes not hither   and will never come   and\\ni myself     he added     actually saw this terrible sight   at the entrance\\nof the chasm   as we were about to reascend   ardiaeus appeared   and some\\nother sinners—most of whom had been tyrants   but not all—and just as\\nthey fancied that they were returning to life   the chasm gave a roar  \\nand then wild   fiery  looking men who knew the meaning of the sound  \\nseized him and several others   and bound them hand and foot and threw\\nthem down   and dragged them along at the side of the road   lacerating\\nthem and carding them like wool   and explaining to the passers  by   that\\nthey were going to be cast into hell     the greatest terror of the\\npilgrims ascending was lest they should hear the voice   and when there\\nwas silence one by one they passed up with joy   to these sufferings\\nthere were corresponding delights  \\n\\non the eighth day the souls of the pilgrims resumed their journey   and\\nin four days came to a spot whence they looked down upon a line of\\nlight   in colour like a rainbow   only brighter and clearer   one day\\nmore brought them to the place   and they saw that this was the column\\nof light which binds together the whole universe   the ends of the\\ncolumn were fastened to heaven   and from them hung the distaff of\\nnecessity   on which all the heavenly bodies turned—the hook and spindle\\nwere of adamant   and the whorl of a mixed substance   the whorl was in\\nform like a number of boxes fitting into one another with their edges\\nturned upwards   making together a single whorl which was pierced by the\\nspindle   the outermost had the rim broadest   and the inner whorls were\\nsmaller and smaller   and had their rims narrower   the largest   the\\nfixed stars   was spangled—the seventh   the sun   was brightest—the\\neighth   the moon   shone by the light of the seventh—the second and\\nfifth   saturn and mercury   were most like one another and yellower than\\nthe eighth—the third   jupiter   had the whitest light—the fourth   mars  \\nwas red—the sixth   venus   was in whiteness second   the whole had one\\nmotion   but while this was revolving in one direction the seven inner\\ncircles were moving in the opposite   with various degrees of swiftness\\nand slowness   the spindle turned on the knees of necessity   and a siren\\nstood hymning upon each circle   while lachesis   clotho   and atropos  \\nthe daughters of necessity   sat on thrones at equal intervals   singing\\nof past   present   and future   responsive to the music of the sirens  \\nclotho from time to time guiding the outer circle with a touch of her\\nright hand   atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner\\ncircles   lachesis in turn putting forth her hand from time to time to\\nguide both of them   on their arrival the pilgrims went to lachesis   and\\nthere was an interpreter who arranged them   and taking from her knees\\nlots   and samples of lives   got up into a pulpit and said     mortal\\nsouls   hear the words of lachesis   the daughter of necessity   a new\\nperiod of mortal life has begun   and you may choose what divinity you\\nplease   the responsibility of choosing is with you—god is blameless    \\nafter speaking thus   he cast the lots among them and each one took up\\nthe lot which fell near him   he then placed on the ground before them\\nthe samples of lives   many more than the souls present   and there were\\nall sorts of lives   of men and of animals   there were tyrannies ending\\nin misery and exile   and lives of men and women famous for their\\ndifferent qualities   and also mixed lives   made up of wealth and\\npoverty   sickness and health   here   glaucon   is the great risk of human\\nlife   and therefore the whole of education should be directed to the\\nacquisition of such a knowledge as will teach a man to refuse the evil\\nand choose the good   he should know all the combinations which occur in\\nlife—of beauty with poverty or with wealth  —of knowledge with external\\ngoods  —and at last choose with reference to the nature of the soul  \\nregarding that only as the better life which makes men better   and\\nleaving the rest   and a man must take with him an iron sense of truth\\nand right into the world below   that there too he may remain undazzled\\nby wealth or the allurements of evil   and be determined to avoid the\\nextremes and choose the mean   for this   as the messenger reported the\\ninterpreter to have said   is the true happiness of man   and any one   as\\nhe proclaimed   may   if he choose with understanding   have a good lot  \\neven though he come last     let not the first be careless in his choice  \\nnor the last despair     he spoke   and when he had spoken   he who had\\ndrawn the first lot chose a tyranny   he did not see that he was fated\\nto devour his own children—and when he discovered his mistake   he wept\\nand beat his breast   blaming chance and the gods and anybody rather\\nthan himself   he was one of those who had come from heaven   and in his\\nprevious life had been a citizen of a well  ordered state   but he had\\nonly habit and no philosophy   like many another   he made a bad choice  \\nbecause he had no experience of life   whereas those who came from earth\\nand had seen trouble were not in such a hurry to choose   but if a man\\nhad followed philosophy while upon earth   and had been moderately\\nfortunate in his lot   he might not only be happy here   but his\\npilgrimage both from and to this world would be smooth and heavenly  \\nnothing was more curious than the spectacle of the choice   at once sad\\nand laughable and wonderful   most of the souls only seeking to avoid\\ntheir own condition in a previous life   he saw the soul of orpheus\\nchanging into a swan because he would not be born of a woman   there was\\nthamyras becoming a nightingale   musical birds   like the swan   choosing\\nto be men   the twentieth soul   which was that of ajax   preferring the\\nlife of a lion to that of a man   in remembrance of the injustice which\\nwas done to him in the judgment of the arms   and agamemnon   from a like\\nenmity to human nature   passing into an eagle   about the middle was the\\nsoul of atalanta choosing the honours of an athlete   and next to her\\nepeus taking the nature of a workwoman   among the last was thersites  \\nwho was changing himself into a monkey   thither   the last of all   came\\nodysseus   and sought the lot of a private man   which lay neglected and\\ndespised   and when he found it he went away rejoicing   and said that if\\nhe had been first instead of last   his choice would have been the same  \\nmen   too   were seen passing into animals   and wild and tame animals\\nchanging into one another  \\n\\nwhen all the souls had chosen they went to lachesis   who sent with each\\nof them their genius or attendant to fulfil their lot   he first of all\\nbrought them under the hand of clotho   and drew them within the\\nrevolution of the spindle impelled by her hand   from her they were\\ncarried to atropos   who made the threads irreversible   whence   without\\nturning round   they passed beneath the throne of necessity   and when\\nthey had all passed   they moved on in scorching heat to the plain of\\nforgetfulness and rested at evening by the river unmindful   whose water\\ncould not be retained in any vessel   of this they had all to drink a\\ncertain quantity—some of them drank more than was required   and he who\\ndrank forgot all things   er himself was prevented from drinking   when\\nthey had gone to rest   about the middle of the night there were\\nthunderstorms and earthquakes   and suddenly they were all driven divers\\nways   shooting like stars to their birth   concerning his return to the\\nbody   he only knew that awaking suddenly in the morning he found\\nhimself lying on the pyre  \\n\\nthus   glaucon   the tale has been saved   and will be our salvation   if\\nwe believe that the soul is immortal   and hold fast to the heavenly way\\nof justice and knowledge   so shall we pass undefiled over the river of\\nforgetfulness   and be dear to ourselves and to the gods   and have a\\ncrown of reward and happiness both in this world and also in the\\nmillennial pilgrimage of the other  \\n\\nthe tenth book of the republic of plato falls into two divisions  \\nfirst   resuming an old thread which has been interrupted   socrates\\nassails the poets   who   now that the nature of the soul has been\\nanalyzed   are seen to be very far gone from the truth   and secondly  \\nhaving shown the reality of the happiness of the just   he demands that\\nappearance shall be restored to him   and then proceeds to prove the\\nimmortality of the soul   the argument   as in the phaedo and gorgias   is\\nsupplemented by the vision of a future life  \\n\\nwhy plato   who was himself a poet   and whose dialogues are poems and\\ndramas   should have been hostile to the poets as a class   and\\nespecially to the dramatic poets   why he should not have seen that\\ntruth may be embodied in verse as well as in prose   and that there are\\nsome indefinable lights and shadows of human life which can only be\\nexpressed in poetry—some elements of imagination which always entwine\\nwith reason   why he should have supposed epic verse to be inseparably\\nassociated with the impurities of the old hellenic mythology   why he\\nshould try homer and hesiod by the unfair and prosaic test of\\nutility  —are questions which have always been debated amongst students\\nof plato   though unable to give a complete answer to them   we may\\nshow—first   that his views arose naturally out of the circumstances of\\nhis age   and secondly   we may elicit the truth as well as the error\\nwhich is contained in them  \\n\\nhe is the enemy of the poets because poetry was declining in his own\\nlifetime   and a theatrocracy   as he says in the laws   had taken the\\nplace of an intellectual aristocracy   euripides exhibited the last\\nphase of the tragic drama   and in him plato saw the friend and\\napologist of tyrants   and the sophist of tragedy   the old comedy was\\nalmost extinct   the new had not yet arisen   dramatic and lyric poetry  \\nlike every other branch of greek literature   was falling under the\\npower of rhetoric   there was no   second or third   to aeschylus and\\nsophocles in the generation which followed them   aristophanes   in one\\nof his later comedies   frogs     speaks of   thousands of tragedy  making\\nprattlers     whose attempts at poetry he compares to the chirping of\\nswallows     their garrulity went far beyond euripides    —  they appeared\\nonce upon the stage   and there was an end of them     to a man of genius\\nwho had a real appreciation of the godlike aeschylus and the noble and\\ngentle sophocles   though disagreeing with some parts of their\\n  theology     rep       these   minor poets   must have been contemptible and\\nintolerable   there is no feeling stronger in the dialogues of plato\\nthan a sense of the decline and decay both in literature and in\\npolitics which marked his own age   nor can he have been expected to\\nlook with favour on the licence of aristophanes   now at the end of his\\ncareer   who had begun by satirizing socrates in the clouds   and in a\\nsimilar spirit forty years afterwards had satirized the founders of\\nideal commonwealths in his eccleziazusae   or female parliament   laws    \\n\\nthere were other reasons for the antagonism of plato to poetry   the\\nprofession of an actor was regarded by him as a degradation of human\\nnature   for   one man in his life   cannot   play many parts     the\\ncharacters which the actor performs seem to destroy his own character  \\nand to leave nothing which can be truly called himself   neither can any\\nman live his life and act it   the actor is the slave of his art   not\\nthe master of it   taking this view plato is more decided in his\\nexpulsion of the dramatic than of the epic poets   though he must have\\nknown that the greek tragedians afforded noble lessons and examples of\\nvirtue and patriotism   to which nothing in homer can be compared   but\\ngreat dramatic or even great rhetorical power is hardly consistent with\\nfirmness or strength of mind   and dramatic talent is often incidentally\\nassociated with a weak or dissolute character  \\n\\nin the tenth book plato introduces a new series of objections   first  \\nhe says that the poet or painter is an imitator   and in the third\\ndegree removed from the truth   his creations are not tested by rule and\\nmeasure   they are only appearances   in modern times we should say that\\nart is not merely imitation   but rather the expression of the ideal in\\nforms of sense   even adopting the humble image of plato   from which his\\nargument derives a colour   we should maintain that the artist may\\nennoble the bed which he paints by the folds of the drapery   or by the\\nfeeling of home which he introduces   and there have been modern\\npainters who have imparted such an ideal interest to a blacksmith  s or\\na carpenter  s shop   the eye or mind which feels as well as sees can\\ngive dignity and pathos to a ruined mill   or a straw  built shed\\n  rembrandt     to the hull of a vessel   going to its last home     turner    \\nstill more would this apply to the greatest works of art   which seem to\\nbe the visible embodiment of the divine   had plato been asked whether\\nthe zeus or athene of pheidias was the imitation of an imitation only  \\nwould he not have been compelled to admit that something more was to be\\nfound in them than in the form of any mortal   and that the rule of\\nproportion to which they conformed was   higher far than any geometry or\\narithmetic could express       statesman    \\n\\nagain   plato objects to the imitative arts that they express the\\nemotional rather than the rational part of human nature   he does not\\nadmit aristotle  s theory   that tragedy or other serious imitations are\\na purgation of the passions by pity and fear   to him they appear only\\nto afford the opportunity of indulging them   yet we must acknowledge\\nthat we may sometimes cure disordered emotions by giving expression to\\nthem   and that they often gain strength when pent up within our own\\nbreast   it is not every indulgence of the feelings which is to be\\ncondemned   for there may be a gratification of the higher as well as of\\nthe lower—thoughts which are too deep or too sad to be expressed by\\nourselves   may find an utterance in the words of poets   every one would\\nacknowledge that there have been times when they were consoled and\\nelevated by beautiful music or by the sublimity of architecture or by\\nthe peacefulness of nature   plato has himself admitted   in the earlier\\npart of the republic   that the arts might have the effect of\\nharmonizing as well as of enervating the mind   but in the tenth book he\\nregards them through a stoic or puritan medium   he asks only   what good\\nhave they done     and is not satisfied with the reply   that   they have\\ngiven innocent pleasure to mankind    \\n\\nhe tells us that he rejoices in the banishment of the poets   since he\\nhas found by the analysis of the soul that they are concerned with the\\ninferior faculties   he means to say that the higher faculties have to\\ndo with universals   the lower with particulars of sense   the poets are\\non a level with their own age   but not on a level with socrates and\\nplato   and he was well aware that homer and hesiod could not be made a\\nrule of life by any process of legitimate interpretation   his ironical\\nuse of them is in fact a denial of their authority   he saw   too   that\\nthe poets were not critics—as he says in the apology     any one was a\\nbetter interpreter of their writings than they were themselves   he\\nhimself ceased to be a poet when he became a disciple of socrates  \\nthough   as he tells us of solon     he might have been one of the\\ngreatest of them   if he had not been deterred by other pursuits     tim    \\nthus from many points of view there is an antagonism between plato and\\nthe poets   which was foreshadowed to him in the old quarrel between\\nphilosophy and poetry   the poets   as he says in the protagoras   were\\nthe sophists of their day   and his dislike of the one class is\\nreflected on the other   he regards them both as the enemies of\\nreasoning and abstraction   though in the case of euripides more with\\nreference to his immoral sentiments about tyrants and the like   for\\nplato is the prophet who   came into the world to convince men  —first of\\nthe fallibility of sense and opinion   and secondly of the reality of\\nabstract ideas   whatever strangeness there may be in modern times in\\nopposing philosophy to poetry   which to us seem to have so many\\nelements in common   the strangeness will disappear if we conceive of\\npoetry as allied to sense   and of philosophy as equivalent to thought\\nand abstraction   unfortunately the very word   idea     which to plato is\\nexpressive of the most real of all things   is associated in our minds\\nwith an element of subjectiveness and unreality   we may note also how\\nhe differs from aristotle who declares poetry to be truer than history  \\nfor the opposite reason   because it is concerned with universals   not\\nlike history   with particulars   poet    \\n\\nthe things which are seen are opposed in scripture to the things which\\nare unseen—they are equally opposed in plato to universals and ideas  \\nto him all particulars appear to be floating about in a world of sense  \\nthey have a taint of error or even of evil   there is no difficulty in\\nseeing that this is an illusion   for there is no more error or\\nvariation in an individual man   horse   bed   etc     than in the class\\nman   horse   bed   etc     nor is the truth which is displayed in\\nindividual instances less certain than that which is conveyed through\\nthe medium of ideas   but plato   who is deeply impressed with the real\\nimportance of universals as instruments of thought   attributes to them\\nan essential truth which is imaginary and unreal   for universals may be\\noften false and particulars true   had he attained to any clear\\nconception of the individual   which is the synthesis of the universal\\nand the particular   or had he been able to distinguish between opinion\\nand sensation   which the ambiguity of the words   greek   and the like  \\ntended to confuse   he would not have denied truth to the particulars of\\nsense  \\n\\nbut the poets are also the representatives of falsehood and feigning in\\nall departments of life and knowledge   like the sophists and\\nrhetoricians of the gorgias and phaedrus   they are the false priests  \\nfalse prophets   lying spirits   enchanters of the world   there is\\nanother count put into the indictment against them by plato   that they\\nare the friends of the tyrant   and bask in the sunshine of his\\npatronage   despotism in all ages has had an apparatus of false ideas\\nand false teachers at its service—in the history of modern europe as\\nwell as of greece and rome   for no government of men depends solely\\nupon force   without some corruption of literature and morals—some\\nappeal to the imagination of the masses—some pretence to the favour of\\nheaven—some element of good giving power to evil   tyranny   even for a\\nshort time   cannot be maintained   the greek tyrants were not insensible\\nto the importance of awakening in their cause a pseudo  hellenic\\nfeeling   they were proud of successes at the olympic games   they were\\nnot devoid of the love of literature and art   plato is thinking in the\\nfirst instance of greek poets who had graced the courts of dionysius or\\narchelaus   and the old spirit of freedom is roused within him at their\\nprostitution of the tragic muse in the praises of tyranny   but his\\nprophetic eye extends beyond them to the false teachers of other ages\\nwho are the creatures of the government under which they live   he\\ncompares the corruption of his contemporaries with the idea of a\\nperfect society   and gathers up into one mass of evil the evils and\\nerrors of mankind   to him they are personified in the rhetoricians  \\nsophists   poets   rulers who deceive and govern the world  \\n\\na further objection which plato makes to poetry and the imitative arts\\nis that they excite the emotions   here the modern reader will be\\ndisposed to introduce a distinction which appears to have escaped him  \\nfor the emotions are neither bad nor good in themselves   and are not\\nmost likely to be controlled by the attempt to eradicate them   but by\\nthe moderate indulgence of them   and the vocation of art is to present\\nthought in the form of feeling   to enlist the feelings on the side of\\nreason   to inspire even for a moment courage or resignation   perhaps to\\nsuggest a sense of infinity and eternity in a way which mere language\\nis incapable of attaining   true   the same power which in the purer age\\nof art embodies gods and heroes only   may be made to express the\\nvoluptuous image of a corinthian courtezan   but this only shows that\\nart   like other outward things   may be turned to good and also to evil  \\nand is not more closely connected with the higher than with the lower\\npart of the soul   all imitative art is subject to certain limitations  \\nand therefore necessarily partakes of the nature of a compromise  \\nsomething of ideal truth is sacrificed for the sake of the\\nrepresentation   and something in the exactness of the representation is\\nsacrificed to the ideal   still   works of art have a permanent element  \\nthey idealize and detain the passing thought   and are the intermediates\\nbetween sense and ideas  \\n\\nin the present stage of the human mind   poetry and other forms of\\nfiction may certainly be regarded as a good   but we can also imagine\\nthe existence of an age in which a severer conception of truth has\\neither banished or transformed them   at any rate we must admit that\\nthey hold a different place at different periods of the world  s\\nhistory   in the infancy of mankind   poetry   with the exception of\\nproverbs   is the whole of literature   and the only instrument of\\nintellectual culture   in modern times she is the shadow or echo of her\\nformer self   and appears to have a precarious existence   milton in his\\nday doubted whether an epic poem was any longer possible   at the same\\ntime we must remember   that what plato would have called the charms of\\npoetry have been partly transferred to prose   he himself   statesman  \\nadmits rhetoric to be the handmaiden of politics   and proposes to find\\nin the strain of law   laws   a substitute for the old poets   among\\nourselves the creative power seems often to be growing weaker   and\\nscientific fact to be more engrossing and overpowering to the mind than\\nformerly   the illusion of the feelings commonly called love   has\\nhitherto been the inspiring influence of modern poetry and romance   and\\nhas exercised a humanizing if not a strengthening influence on the\\nworld   but may not the stimulus which love has given to fancy be some\\nday exhausted   the modern english novel which is the most popular of\\nall forms of reading is not more than a century or two old   will the\\ntale of love a hundred years hence   after so many thousand variations\\nof the same theme   be still received with unabated interest  \\n\\nart cannot claim to be on a level with philosophy or religion   and may\\noften corrupt them   it is possible to conceive a mental state in which\\nall artistic representations are regarded as a false and imperfect\\nexpression   either of the religious ideal or of the philosophical\\nideal   the fairest forms may be revolting in certain moods of mind   as\\nis proved by the fact that the mahometans   and many sects of\\nchristians   have renounced the use of pictures and images   the\\nbeginning of a great religion   whether christian or gentile   has not\\nbeen   wood or stone     but a spirit moving in the hearts of men   the\\ndisciples have met in a large upper room or in   holes and caves of the\\nearth     in the second or third generation   they have had mosques  \\ntemples   churches   monasteries   and the revival or reform of religions  \\nlike the first revelation of them   has come from within and has\\ngenerally disregarded external ceremonies and accompaniments  \\n\\nbut poetry and art may also be the expression of the highest truth and\\nthe purest sentiment   plato himself seems to waver between two opposite\\nviews—when   as in the third book   he insists that youth should be\\nbrought up amid wholesome imagery   and again in book x   when he\\nbanishes the poets from his republic   admitting that the arts   which\\nsome of us almost deify   have fallen short of their higher aim   we must\\nadmit on the other hand that to banish imagination wholly would be\\nsuicidal as well as impossible   for nature too is a form of art   and a\\nbreath of the fresh air or a single glance at the varying landscape\\nwould in an instant revive and reillumine the extinguished spark of\\npoetry in the human breast   in the lower stages of civilization\\nimagination more than reason distinguishes man from the animals   and to\\nbanish art would be to banish thought   to banish language   to banish\\nthe expression of all truth   no religion is wholly devoid of external\\nforms   even the mahometan who renounces the use of pictures and images\\nhas a temple in which he worships the most high   as solemn and\\nbeautiful as any greek or christian building   feeling too and thought\\nare not really opposed   for he who thinks must feel before he can\\nexecute   and the highest thoughts   when they become familiarized to us  \\nare always tending to pass into the form of feeling  \\n\\nplato does not seriously intend to expel poets from life and society  \\nbut he feels strongly the unreality of their writings   he is protesting\\nagainst the degeneracy of poetry in his own day as we might protest\\nagainst the want of serious purpose in modern fiction   against the\\nunseemliness or extravagance of some of our poets or novelists   against\\nthe time  serving of preachers or public writers   against the\\nregardlessness of truth which to the eye of the philosopher seems to\\ncharacterize the greater part of the world   for we too have reason to\\ncomplain that our poets and novelists   paint inferior truth   and   are\\nconcerned with the inferior part of the soul     that the readers of them\\nbecome what they read and are injuriously affected by them   and we look\\nin vain for that healthy atmosphere of which plato speaks  —  the beauty\\nwhich meets the sense like a breeze and imperceptibly draws the soul  \\neven in childhood   into harmony with the beauty of reason    \\n\\nfor there might be a poetry which would be the hymn of divine\\nperfection   the harmony of goodness and truth among men   a strain which\\nshould renew the youth of the world   and bring back the ages in which\\nthe poet was man  s only teacher and best friend  —which would find\\nmaterials in the living present as well as in the romance of the past  \\nand might subdue to the fairest forms of speech and verse the\\nintractable materials of modern civilisation  —which might elicit the\\nsimple principles   or   as plato would have called them   the essential\\nforms   of truth and justice out of the variety of opinion and the\\ncomplexity of modern society  —which would preserve all the good of each\\ngeneration and leave the bad unsung  —which should be based not on vain\\nlongings or faint imaginings   but on a clear insight into the nature of\\nman   then the tale of love might begin again in poetry or prose   two in\\none   united in the pursuit of knowledge   or the service of god and man  \\nand feelings of love might still be the incentive to great thoughts and\\nheroic deeds as in the days of dante or petrarch   and many types of\\nmanly and womanly beauty might appear among us   rising above the\\nordinary level of humanity   and many lives which were like poems\\n  laws     be not only written   but lived by us   a few such strains have\\nbeen heard among men in the tragedies of aeschylus and sophocles   whom\\nplato quotes   not   as homer is quoted by him   in irony   but with deep\\nand serious approval  —in the poetry of milton and wordsworth   and in\\npassages of other english poets  —first and above all in the hebrew\\nprophets and psalmists   shakespeare has taught us how great men should\\nspeak and act   he has drawn characters of a wonderful purity and depth  \\nhe has ennobled the human mind   but   like homer   rep       he   has left no\\nway of life     the next greatest poet of modern times   goethe   is\\nconcerned with   a lower degree of truth     he paints the world as a\\nstage on which   all the men and women are merely players     he\\ncultivates life as an art   but he furnishes no ideals of truth and\\naction   the poet may rebel against any attempt to set limits to his\\nfancy   and he may argue truly that moralizing in verse is not poetry  \\npossibly   like mephistopheles in faust   he may retaliate on his\\nadversaries   but the philosopher will still be justified in asking  \\n  how may the heavenly gift of poesy be devoted to the good of mankind    \\n\\nreturning to plato   we may observe that a similar mixture of truth and\\nerror appears in other parts of the argument   he is aware of the\\nabsurdity of mankind framing their whole lives according to homer   just\\nas in the phaedrus he intimates the absurdity of interpreting mythology\\nupon rational principles   both these were the modern tendencies of his\\nown age   which he deservedly ridicules   on the other hand   his argument\\nthat homer   if he had been able to teach mankind anything worth\\nknowing   would not have been allowed by them to go about begging as a\\nrhapsodist   is both false and contrary to the spirit of plato   rep      \\nit may be compared with those other paradoxes of the gorgias   that   no\\nstatesman was ever unjustly put to death by the city of which he was\\nthe head     and that   no sophist was ever defrauded by his pupils  \\n  gorg          \\n\\nthe argument for immortality seems to rest on the absolute dualism of\\nsoul and body   admitting the existence of the soul   we know of no force\\nwhich is able to put an end to her   vice is her own proper evil   and if\\nshe cannot be destroyed by that   she cannot be destroyed by any other  \\nyet plato has acknowledged that the soul may be so overgrown by the\\nincrustations of earth as to lose her original form   and in the timaeus\\nhe recognizes more strongly than in the republic the influence which\\nthe body has over the mind   denying even the voluntariness of human\\nactions   on the ground that they proceed from physical states   tim      \\nin the republic   as elsewhere   he wavers between the original soul\\nwhich has to be restored   and the character which is developed by\\ntraining and education      \\n\\nthe vision of another world is ascribed to er   the son of armenius   who\\nis said by clement of alexandria to have been zoroaster   the tale has\\ncertainly an oriental character   and may be compared with the\\npilgrimages of the soul in the zend avesta   haug   avesta     but no trace\\nof acquaintance with zoroaster is found elsewhere in plato  s writings  \\nand there is no reason for giving him the name of er the pamphylian  \\nthe philosophy of heracleitus cannot be shown to be borrowed from\\nzoroaster   and still less the myths of plato  \\n\\nthe local arrangement of the vision is less distinct than that of the\\nphaedrus and phaedo   astronomy is mingled with symbolism and mythology  \\nthe great sphere of heaven is represented under the symbol of a\\ncylinder or box   containing the seven orbits of the planets and the\\nfixed stars   this is suspended from an axis or spindle which turns on\\nthe knees of necessity   the revolutions of the seven orbits contained\\nin the cylinder are guided by the fates   and their harmonious motion\\nproduces the music of the spheres   through the innermost or eighth of\\nthese   which is the moon   is passed the spindle   but it is doubtful\\nwhether this is the continuation of the column of light   from which the\\npilgrims contemplate the heavens   the words of plato imply that they\\nare connected   but not the same   the column itself is clearly not of\\nadamant   the spindle   which is of adamant   is fastened to the ends of\\nthe chains which extend to the middle of the column of light—this\\ncolumn is said to hold together the heaven   but whether it hangs from\\nthe spindle   or is at right angles to it   is not explained   the\\ncylinder containing the orbits of the stars is almost as much a symbol\\nas the figure of necessity turning the spindle  —for the outermost rim\\nis the sphere of the fixed stars   and nothing is said about the\\nintervals of space which divide the paths of the stars in the heavens  \\nthe description is both a picture and an orrery   and therefore is\\nnecessarily inconsistent with itself   the column of light is not the\\nmilky way—which is neither straight   nor like a rainbow—but the\\nimaginary axis of the earth   this is compared to the rainbow in respect\\nnot of form but of colour   and not to the undergirders of a trireme  \\nbut to the straight rope running from prow to stern in which the\\nundergirders meet  \\n\\nthe orrery or picture of the heavens given in the republic differs in\\nits mode of representation from the circles of the same and of the\\nother in the timaeus   in both the fixed stars are distinguished from\\nthe planets   and they move in orbits without them   although in an\\nopposite direction   in the republic as in the timaeus they are all\\nmoving round the axis of the world   but we are not certain that in the\\nformer they are moving round the earth   no distinct mention is made in\\nthe republic of the circles of the same and other   although both in the\\ntimaeus and in the republic the motion of the fixed stars is supposed\\nto coincide with the motion of the whole   the relative thickness of the\\nrims is perhaps designed to express the relative distances of the\\nplanets   plato probably intended to represent the earth   from which er\\nand his companions are viewing the heavens   as stationary in place   but\\nwhether or not herself revolving   unless this is implied in the\\nrevolution of the axis   is uncertain   timaeus     the spectator may be\\nsupposed to look at the heavenly bodies   either from above or below  \\nthe earth is a sort of earth and heaven in one   like the heaven of the\\nphaedrus   on the back of which the spectator goes out to take a peep at\\nthe stars and is borne round in the revolution   there is no distinction\\nbetween the equator and the ecliptic   but plato is no doubt led to\\nimagine that the planets have an opposite motion to that of the fixed\\nstars   in order to account for their appearances in the heavens   in the\\ndescription of the meadow   and the retribution of the good and evil\\nafter death   there are traces of homer  \\n\\nthe description of the axis as a spindle   and of the heavenly bodies as\\nforming a whole   partly arises out of the attempt to connect the\\nmotions of the heavenly bodies with the mythological image of the web  \\nor weaving of the fates   the giving of the lots   the weaving of them  \\nand the making of them irreversible   which are ascribed to the three\\nfates—lachesis   clotho   atropos   are obviously derived from their\\nnames   the element of chance in human life is indicated by the order of\\nthe lots   but chance   however adverse   may be overcome by the wisdom of\\nman   if he knows how to choose aright   there is a worse enemy to man\\nthan chance   this enemy is himself   he who was moderately fortunate in\\nthe number of the lot—even the very last comer—might have a good life\\nif he chose with wisdom   and as plato does not like to make an\\nassertion which is unproven   he more than confirms this statement a few\\nsentences afterwards by the example of odysseus   who chose last   but\\nthe virtue which is founded on habit is not sufficient to enable a man\\nto choose   he must add to virtue knowledge   if he is to act rightly\\nwhen placed in new circumstances   the routine of good actions and good\\nhabits is an inferior sort of goodness   and   as coleridge says     common\\nsense is intolerable which is not based on metaphysics     so plato would\\nhave said     habit is worthless which is not based upon philosophy    \\n\\nthe freedom of the will to refuse the evil and to choose the good is\\ndistinctly asserted     virtue is free   and as a man honours or\\ndishonours her he will have more or less of her     the life of man is\\n  rounded   by necessity   there are circumstances prior to birth which\\naffect him   pol       but within the walls of necessity there is an open\\nspace in which he is his own master   and can study for himself the\\neffects which the variously compounded gifts of nature or fortune have\\nupon the soul   and act accordingly   all men cannot have the first\\nchoice in everything   but the lot of all men is good enough   if they\\nchoose wisely and will live diligently  \\n\\nthe verisimilitude which is given to the pilgrimage of a thousand\\nyears   by the intimation that ardiaeus had lived a thousand years\\nbefore   the coincidence of er coming to life on the twelfth day after\\nhe was supposed to have been dead with the seven days which the\\npilgrims passed in the meadow   and the four days during which they\\njourneyed to the column of light   the precision with which the soul is\\nmentioned who chose the twentieth lot   the passing remarks that there\\nwas no definite character among the souls   and that the souls which had\\nchosen ill blamed any one rather than themselves   or that some of the\\nsouls drank more than was necessary of the waters of forgetfulness  \\nwhile er himself was hindered from drinking   the desire of odysseus to\\nrest at last   unlike the conception of him in dante and tennyson   the\\nfeigned ignorance of how er returned to the body   when the other souls\\nwent shooting like stars to their birth  —add greatly to the probability\\nof the narrative   they are such touches of nature as the art of defoe\\nmight have introduced when he wished to win credibility for marvels and\\napparitions  \\n\\n\\nthere still remain to be considered some points which have been\\nintentionally reserved to the end     1   the janus  like character of the\\nrepublic   which presents two faces—one an hellenic state   the other a\\nkingdom of philosophers   connected with the latter of the two aspects\\nare   2   the paradoxes of the republic   as they have been termed by\\nmorgenstern     a   the community of property     b   of families     c   the\\nrule of philosophers     d   the analogy of the individual and the state  \\nwhich   like some other analogies in the republic   is carried too far  \\nwe may then proceed to consider   3   the subject of education as\\nconceived by plato   bringing together in a general view the education\\nof youth and the education of after  life     4   we may note further some\\nessential differences between ancient and modern politics which are\\nsuggested by the republic     5   we may compare the politicus and the\\nlaws     6   we may observe the influence exercised by plato on his\\nimitators   and   7   take occasion to consider the nature and value of\\npolitical   and   8   of religious ideals  \\n\\n1   plato expressly says that he is intending to found an hellenic state\\n  book v     many of his regulations are characteristically spartan   such\\nas the prohibition of gold and silver   the common meals of the men   the\\nmilitary training of the youth   the gymnastic exercises of the women  \\nthe life of sparta was the life of a camp   laws     enforced even more\\nrigidly in time of peace than in war   the citizens of sparta   like\\nplato  s   were forbidden to trade—they were to be soldiers and not\\nshopkeepers   nowhere else in greece was the individual so completely\\nsubjected to the state   the time when he was to marry   the education of\\nhis children   the clothes which he was to wear   the food which he was\\nto eat   were all prescribed by law   some of the best enactments in the\\nrepublic   such as the reverence to be paid to parents and elders   and\\nsome of the worst   such as the exposure of deformed children   are\\nborrowed from the practice of sparta   the encouragement of friendships\\nbetween men and youths   or of men with one another   as affording\\nincentives to bravery   is also spartan   in sparta too a nearer approach\\nwas made than in any other greek state to equality of the sexes   and to\\ncommunity of property   and while there was probably less of\\nlicentiousness in the sense of immorality   the tie of marriage was\\nregarded more lightly than in the rest of greece   the   suprema lex   was\\nthe preservation of the family   and the interest of the state   the\\ncoarse strength of a military government was not favourable to purity\\nand refinement   and the excessive strictness of some regulations seems\\nto have produced a reaction   of all hellenes the spartans were most\\naccessible to bribery   several of the greatest of them might be\\ndescribed in the words of plato as having a   fierce secret longing\\nafter gold and silver     though not in the strict sense communists   the\\nprinciple of communism was maintained among them in their division of\\nlands   in their common meals   in their slaves   and in the free use of\\none another  s goods   marriage was a public institution   and the women\\nwere educated by the state   and sang and danced in public with the men  \\n\\nmany traditions were preserved at sparta of the severity with which the\\nmagistrates had maintained the primitive rule of music and poetry   as\\nin the republic of plato   the new  fangled poet was to be expelled  \\nhymns to the gods   which are the only kind of music admitted into the\\nideal state   were the only kind which was permitted at sparta   the\\nspartans   though an unpoetical race   were nevertheless lovers of\\npoetry   they had been stirred by the elegiac strains of tyrtaeus   they\\nhad crowded around hippias to hear his recitals of homer   but in this\\nthey resembled the citizens of the timocratic rather than of the ideal\\nstate   the council of elder men also corresponds to the spartan\\ngerousia   and the freedom with which they are permitted to judge about\\nmatters of detail agrees with what we are told of that institution  \\nonce more   the military rule of not spoiling the dead or offering arms\\nat the temples   the moderation in the pursuit of enemies   the\\nimportance attached to the physical well  being of the citizens   the use\\nof warfare for the sake of defence rather than of aggression—are\\nfeatures probably suggested by the spirit and practice of sparta  \\n\\nto the spartan type the ideal state reverts in the first decline   and\\nthe character of the individual timocrat is borrowed from the spartan\\ncitizen   the love of lacedaemon not only affected plato and xenophon  \\nbut was shared by many undistinguished athenians   there they seemed to\\nfind a principle which was wanting in their own democracy   the   greek  \\nof the spartans attracted them   that is to say   not the goodness of\\ntheir laws   but the spirit of order and loyalty which prevailed  \\nfascinated by the idea   citizens of athens would imitate the\\nlacedaemonians in their dress and manners   they were known to the\\ncontemporaries of plato as   the persons who had their ears bruised    \\nlike the roundheads of the commonwealth   the love of another church or\\ncountry when seen at a distance only   the longing for an imaginary\\nsimplicity in civilized times   the fond desire of a past which never\\nhas been   or of a future which never will be  —these are aspirations of\\nthe human mind which are often felt among ourselves   such feelings meet\\nwith a response in the republic of plato  \\n\\nbut there are other features of the platonic republic   as   for example  \\nthe literary and philosophical education   and the grace and beauty of\\nlife   which are the reverse of spartan   plato wishes to give his\\ncitizens a taste of athenian freedom as well as of lacedaemonian\\ndiscipline   his individual genius is purely athenian   although in\\ntheory he is a lover of sparta   and he is something more than either—he\\nhas also a true hellenic feeling   he is desirous of humanizing the wars\\nof hellenes against one another   he acknowledges that the delphian god\\nis the grand hereditary interpreter of all hellas   the spirit of\\nharmony and the dorian mode are to prevail   and the whole state is to\\nhave an external beauty which is the reflex of the harmony within   but\\nhe has not yet found out the truth which he afterwards enunciated in\\nthe laws—that he was a better legislator who made men to be of one\\nmind   than he who trained them for war   the citizens   as in other\\nhellenic states   democratic as well as aristocratic   are really an\\nupper class   for   although no mention is made of slaves   the lower\\nclasses are allowed to fade away into the distance   and are represented\\nin the individual by the passions   plato has no idea either of a social\\nstate in which all classes are harmonized   or of a federation of hellas\\nor the world in which different nations or states have a place   his\\ncity is equipped for war rather than for peace   and this would seem to\\nbe justified by the ordinary condition of hellenic states   the myth of\\nthe earth  born men is an embodiment of the orthodox tradition of\\nhellas   and the allusion to the four ages of the world is also\\nsanctioned by the authority of hesiod and the poets   thus we see that\\nthe republic is partly founded on the ideal of the old greek polis  \\npartly on the actual circumstances of hellas in that age   plato   like\\nthe old painters   retains the traditional form   and like them he has\\nalso a vision of a city in the clouds  \\n\\nthere is yet another thread which is interwoven in the texture of the\\nwork   for the republic is not only a dorian state   but a pythagorean\\nleague   the   way of life   which was connected with the name of\\npythagoras   like the catholic monastic orders   showed the power which\\nthe mind of an individual might exercise over his contemporaries   and\\nmay have naturally suggested to plato the possibility of reviving such\\n  mediaeval institutions     the pythagoreans   like plato   enforced a rule\\nof life and a moral and intellectual training   the influence ascribed\\nto music   which to us seems exaggerated   is also a pythagorean feature  \\nit is not to be regarded as representing the real influence of music in\\nthe greek world   more nearly than any other government of hellas   the\\npythagorean league of three hundred was an aristocracy of virtue   for\\nonce in the history of mankind the philosophy of order or   greek    \\nexpressing and consequently enlisting on its side the combined\\nendeavours of the better part of the people   obtained the management of\\npublic affairs and held possession of it for a considerable time   until\\nabout b  c   500     probably only in states prepared by dorian\\ninstitutions would such a league have been possible   the rulers   like\\nplato  s   greek     were required to submit to a severe training in order\\nto prepare the way for the education of the other members of the\\ncommunity   long after the dissolution of the order   eminent\\npythagoreans   such as archytas of tarentum   retained their political\\ninfluence over the cities of magna graecia   there was much here that\\nwas suggestive to the kindred spirit of plato   who had doubtless\\nmeditated deeply on the   way of life of pythagoras     rep     and his\\nfollowers   slight traces of pythagoreanism are to be found in the\\nmystical number of the state   in the number which expresses the\\ninterval between the king and the tyrant   in the doctrine of\\ntransmigration   in the music of the spheres   as well as in the great\\nthough secondary importance ascribed to mathematics in education  \\n\\nbut as in his philosophy   so also in the form of his state   he goes far\\nbeyond the old pythagoreans   he attempts a task really impossible  \\nwhich is to unite the past of greek history with the future of\\nphilosophy   analogous to that other impossibility   which has often been\\nthe dream of christendom   the attempt to unite the past history of\\neurope with the kingdom of christ   nothing actually existing in the\\nworld at all resembles plato  s ideal state   nor does he himself imagine\\nthat such a state is possible   this he repeats again and again   e  g   in\\nthe republic   or in the laws where   casting a glance back on the\\nrepublic   he admits that the perfect state of communism and philosophy\\nwas impossible in his own age   though still to be retained as a\\npattern   the same doubt is implied in the earnestness with which he\\nargues in the republic that ideals are none the worse because they\\ncannot be realized in fact   and in the chorus of laughter   which like a\\nbreaking wave will   as he anticipates   greet the mention of his\\nproposals   though like other writers of fiction   he uses all his art to\\ngive reality to his inventions   when asked how the ideal polity can\\ncome into being   he answers ironically     when one son of a king becomes\\na philosopher     he designates the fiction of the earth  born men as   a\\nnoble lie     and when the structure is finally complete   he fairly tells\\nyou that his republic is a vision only   which in some sense may have\\nreality   but not in the vulgar one of a reign of philosophers upon\\nearth   it has been said that plato flies as well as walks   but this\\nfalls short of the truth   for he flies and walks at the same time   and\\nis in the air and on firm ground in successive instants  \\n\\nniebuhr has asked a trifling question   which may be briefly noticed in\\nthis place—was plato a good citizen   if by this is meant   was he loyal\\nto athenian institutions  —he can hardly be said to be the friend of\\ndemocracy   but neither is he the friend of any other existing form of\\ngovernment   all of them he regarded as   states of faction     laws     none\\nattained to his ideal of a voluntary rule over voluntary subjects  \\nwhich seems indeed more nearly to describe democracy than any other  \\nand the worst of them is tyranny   the truth is   that the question has\\nhardly any meaning when applied to a great philosopher whose writings\\nare not meant for a particular age and country   but for all time and\\nall mankind   the decline of athenian politics was probably the motive\\nwhich led plato to frame an ideal state   and the republic may be\\nregarded as reflecting the departing glory of hellas   as well might we\\ncomplain of st   augustine   whose great work   the city of god  \\noriginated in a similar motive   for not being loyal to the roman\\nempire   even a nearer parallel might be afforded by the first\\nchristians   who cannot fairly be charged with being bad citizens\\nbecause   though   subject to the higher powers     they were looking\\nforward to a city which is in heaven  \\n\\n2   the idea of the perfect state is full of paradox when judged of\\naccording to the ordinary notions of mankind   the paradoxes of one age\\nhave been said to become the commonplaces of the next   but the\\nparadoxes of plato are at least as paradoxical to us as they were to\\nhis contemporaries   the modern world has either sneered at them as\\nabsurd   or denounced them as unnatural and immoral   men have been\\npleased to find in aristotle  s criticisms of them the anticipation of\\ntheir own good sense   the wealthy and cultivated classes have disliked\\nand also dreaded them   they have pointed with satisfaction to the\\nfailure of efforts to realize them in practice   yet since they are the\\nthoughts of one of the greatest of human intelligences   and of one who\\nhad done most to elevate morality and religion   they seem to deserve a\\nbetter treatment at our hands   we may have to address the public   as\\nplato does poetry   and assure them that we mean no harm to existing\\ninstitutions   there are serious errors which have a side of truth and\\nwhich therefore may fairly demand a careful consideration   there are\\ntruths mixed with error of which we may indeed say     the half is better\\nthan the whole     yet   the half   may be an important contribution to the\\nstudy of human nature  \\n\\n  a   the first paradox is the community of goods   which is mentioned\\nslightly at the end of the third book   and seemingly   as aristotle\\nobserves   is confined to the guardians   at least no mention is made of\\nthe other classes   but the omission is not of any real significance  \\nand probably arises out of the plan of the work   which prevents the\\nwriter from entering into details  \\n\\naristotle censures the community of property much in the spirit of\\nmodern political economy   as tending to repress industry   and as doing\\naway with the spirit of benevolence   modern writers almost refuse to\\nconsider the subject   which is supposed to have been long ago settled\\nby the common opinion of mankind   but it must be remembered that the\\nsacredness of property is a notion far more fixed in modern than in\\nancient times   the world has grown older   and is therefore more\\nconservative   primitive society offered many examples of land held in\\ncommon   either by a tribe or by a township   and such may probably have\\nbeen the original form of landed tenure   ancient legislators had\\ninvented various modes of dividing and preserving the divisions of land\\namong the citizens   according to aristotle there were nations who held\\nthe land in common and divided the produce   and there were others who\\ndivided the land and stored the produce in common   the evils of debt\\nand the inequality of property were far greater in ancient than in\\nmodern times   and the accidents to which property was subject from war  \\nor revolution   or taxation   or other legislative interference   were\\nalso greater   all these circumstances gave property a less fixed and\\nsacred character   the early christians are believed to have held their\\nproperty in common   and the principle is sanctioned by the words of\\nchrist himself   and has been maintained as a counsel of perfection in\\nalmost all ages of the church   nor have there been wanting instances of\\nmodern enthusiasts who have made a religion of communism   in every age\\nof religious excitement notions like wycliffe  s   inheritance of grace  \\nhave tended to prevail   a like spirit   but fiercer and more violent  \\nhas appeared in politics     the preparation of the gospel of peace   soon\\nbecomes the red flag of republicanism  \\n\\nwe can hardly judge what effect plato  s views would have upon his own\\ncontemporaries   they would perhaps have seemed to them only an\\nexaggeration of the spartan commonwealth   even modern writers would\\nacknowledge that the right of private property is based on expediency  \\nand may be interfered with in a variety of ways for the public good  \\nany other mode of vesting property which was found to be more\\nadvantageous   would in time acquire the same basis of right     the most\\nuseful     in plato  s words     would be the most sacred     the lawyers and\\necclesiastics of former ages would have spoken of property as a sacred\\ninstitution   but they only meant by such language to oppose the\\ngreatest amount of resistance to any invasion of the rights of\\nindividuals and of the church  \\n\\nwhen we consider the question   without any fear of immediate\\napplication to practice   in the spirit of plato  s republic   are we\\nquite sure that the received notions of property are the best   is the\\ndistribution of wealth which is customary in civilized countries the\\nmost favourable that can be conceived for the education and development\\nof the mass of mankind   can   the spectator of all time and all\\nexistence   be quite convinced that one or two thousand years hence  \\ngreat changes will not have taken place in the rights of property   or\\neven that the very notion of property   beyond what is necessary for\\npersonal maintenance   may not have disappeared   this was a distinction\\nfamiliar to aristotle   though likely to be laughed at among ourselves  \\nsuch a change would not be greater than some other changes through\\nwhich the world has passed in the transition from ancient to modern\\nsociety   for example   the emancipation of the serfs in russia   or the\\nabolition of slavery in america and the west indies   and not so great\\nas the difference which separates the eastern village community from\\nthe western world   to accomplish such a revolution in the course of a\\nfew centuries   would imply a rate of progress not more rapid than has\\nactually taken place during the last fifty or sixty years   the kingdom\\nof japan underwent more change in five or six years than europe in five\\nor six hundred   many opinions and beliefs which have been cherished\\namong ourselves quite as strongly as the sacredness of property have\\npassed away   and the most untenable propositions respecting the right\\nof bequests or entail have been maintained with as much fervour as the\\nmost moderate   some one will be heard to ask whether a state of society\\ncan be final in which the interests of thousands are perilled on the\\nlife or character of a single person   and many will indulge the hope\\nthat our present condition may   after all   be only transitional   and\\nmay conduct to a higher   in which property   besides ministering to the\\nenjoyment of the few   may also furnish the means of the highest culture\\nto all   and will be a greater benefit to the public generally   and also\\nmore under the control of public authority   there may come a time when\\nthe saying     have i not a right to do what i will with my own     will\\nappear to be a barbarous relic of individualism  —when the possession of\\na part may be a greater blessing to each and all than the possession of\\nthe whole is now to any one  \\n\\nsuch reflections appear visionary to the eye of the practical\\nstatesman   but they are within the range of possibility to the\\nphilosopher   he can imagine that in some distant age or clime   and\\nthrough the influence of some individual   the notion of common property\\nmay or might have sunk as deep into the heart of a race   and have\\nbecome as fixed to them   as private property is to ourselves   he knows\\nthat this latter institution is not more than four or five thousand\\nyears old   may not the end revert to the beginning   in our own age even\\nutopias affect the spirit of legislation   and an abstract idea may\\nexercise a great influence on practical politics  \\n\\nthe objections that would be generally urged against plato  s community\\nof property   are the old ones of aristotle   that motives for exertion\\nwould be taken away   and that disputes would arise when each was\\ndependent upon all   every man would produce as little and consume as\\nmuch as he liked   the experience of civilized nations has hitherto been\\nadverse to socialism   the effort is too great for human nature   men try\\nto live in common   but the personal feeling is always breaking in   on\\nthe other hand it may be doubted whether our present notions of\\nproperty are not conventional   for they differ in different countries\\nand in different states of society   we boast of an individualism which\\nis not freedom   but rather an artificial result of the industrial state\\nof modern europe   the individual is nominally free   but he is also\\npowerless in a world bound hand and foot in the chains of economic\\nnecessity   even if we cannot expect the mass of mankind to become\\ndisinterested   at any rate we observe in them a power of organization\\nwhich fifty years ago would never have been suspected   the same forces\\nwhich have revolutionized the political system of europe   may effect a\\nsimilar change in the social and industrial relations of mankind   and\\nif we suppose the influence of some good as well as neutral motives\\nworking in the community   there will be no absurdity in expecting that\\nthe mass of mankind having power   and becoming enlightened about the\\nhigher possibilities of human life   when they learn how much more is\\nattainable for all than is at present the possession of a favoured few  \\nmay pursue the common interest with an intelligence and persistency\\nwhich mankind have hitherto never seen  \\n\\nnow that the world has once been set in motion   and is no longer held\\nfast under the tyranny of custom and ignorance   now that criticism has\\npierced the veil of tradition and the past no longer overpowers the\\npresent  —the progress of civilization may be expected to be far greater\\nand swifter than heretofore   even at our present rate of speed the\\npoint at which we may arrive in two or three generations is beyond the\\npower of imagination to foresee   there are forces in the world which\\nwork   not in an arithmetical   but in a geometrical ratio of increase  \\neducation   to use the expression of plato   moves like a wheel with an\\never  multiplying rapidity   nor can we say how great may be its\\ninfluence   when it becomes universal  —when it has been inherited by\\nmany generations  —when it is freed from the trammels of superstition\\nand rightly adapted to the wants and capacities of different classes of\\nmen and women   neither do we know how much more the co  operation of\\nminds or of hands may be capable of accomplishing   whether in labour or\\nin study   the resources of the natural sciences are not half  developed\\nas yet   the soil of the earth   instead of growing more barren   may\\nbecome many times more fertile than hitherto   the uses of machinery

nations may contribute their thoughts and their experience to\\nthe common stock of humanity   many other elements enter into a\\nspeculation of this kind   but it is better to make an end of them   for\\nsuch reflections appear to the majority far  fetched   and to men of\\nscience   commonplace  \\n\\n  b   neither to the mind of plato nor of aristotle did the doctrine of\\ncommunity of property present at all the same difficulty   or appear to\\nbe the same violation of the common hellenic sentiment   as the\\ncommunity of wives and children   this paradox he prefaces by another\\nproposal   that the occupations of men and women shall be the same   and\\nthat to this end they shall have a common training and education   male\\nand female animals have the same pursuits—why not also the two sexes of\\nman  \\n\\nbut have we not here fallen into a contradiction   for we were saying\\nthat different natures should have different pursuits   how then can men\\nand women have the same   and is not the proposal inconsistent with our\\nnotion of the division of labour  —these objections are no sooner raised\\nthan answered   for   according to plato   there is no organic difference\\nbetween men and women   but only the accidental one that men beget and\\nwomen bear children   following the analogy of the other animals   he\\ncontends that all natural gifts are scattered about indifferently among\\nboth sexes   though there may be a superiority of degree on the part of\\nthe men   the objection on the score of decency to their taking part in\\nthe same gymnastic exercises   is met by plato  s assertion that the\\nexisting feeling is a matter of habit  \\n\\nthat plato should have emancipated himself from the ideas of his own\\ncountry and from the example of the east   shows a wonderful\\nindependence of mind   he is conscious that women are half the human\\nrace   in some respects the more important half   laws     and for the sake\\nboth of men and women he desires to raise the woman to a higher level\\nof existence   he brings   not sentiment   but philosophy to bear upon a\\nquestion which both in ancient and modern times has been chiefly\\nregarded in the light of custom or feeling   the greeks had noble\\nconceptions of womanhood in the goddesses athene and artemis   and in\\nthe heroines antigone and andromache   but these ideals had no\\ncounterpart in actual life   the athenian woman was in no way the equal\\nof her husband   she was not the entertainer of his guests or the\\nmistress of his house   but only his housekeeper and the mother of his\\nchildren   she took no part in military or political matters   nor is\\nthere any instance in the later ages of greece of a woman becoming\\nfamous in literature     hers is the greatest glory who has the least\\nrenown among men     is the historian  s conception of feminine\\nexcellence   a very different ideal of womanhood is held up by plato to\\nthe world   she is to be the companion of the man   and to share with him\\nin the toils of war and in the cares of government   she is to be\\nsimilarly trained both in bodily and mental exercises   she is to lose\\nas far as possible the incidents of maternity and the characteristics\\nof the female sex  \\n\\nthe modern antagonist of the equality of the sexes would argue that the\\ndifferences between men and women are not confined to the single point\\nurged by plato   that sensibility   gentleness   grace   are the qualities\\nof women   while energy   strength   higher intelligence   are to be looked\\nfor in men   and the criticism is just   the differences affect the whole\\nnature   and are not   as plato supposes   confined to a single point   but\\nneither can we say how far these differences are due to education and\\nthe opinions of mankind   or physically inherited from the habits and\\nopinions of former generations   women have been always taught   not\\nexactly that they are slaves   but that they are in an inferior\\nposition   which is also supposed to have compensating advantages   and\\nto this position they have conformed   it is also true that the physical\\nform may easily change in the course of generations through the mode of\\nlife   and the weakness or delicacy   which was once a matter of opinion  \\nmay become a physical fact   the characteristics of sex vary greatly in\\ndifferent countries and ranks of society   and at different ages in the\\nsame individuals   plato may have been right in denying that there was\\nany ultimate difference in the sexes of man other than that which\\nexists in animals   because all other differences may be conceived to\\ndisappear in other states of society   or under different circumstances\\nof life and training  \\n\\nthe first wave having been passed   we proceed to the second—community\\nof wives and children     is it possible   is it desirable     for as\\nglaucon intimates   and as we far more strongly insist     great doubts\\nmay be entertained about both these points     any free discussion of the\\nquestion is impossible   and mankind are perhaps right in not allowing\\nthe ultimate bases of social life to be examined   few of us can safely\\nenquire into the things which nature hides   any more than we can\\ndissect our own bodies   still   the manner in which plato arrived at his\\nconclusions should be considered   for here   as mr   grote has remarked  \\nis a wonderful thing   that one of the wisest and best of men should\\nhave entertained ideas of morality which are wholly at variance with\\nour own   and if we would do plato justice   we must examine carefully\\nthe character of his proposals   first   we may observe that the\\nrelations of the sexes supposed by him are the reverse of licentious  \\nhe seems rather to aim at an impossible strictness   secondly   he\\nconceives the family to be the natural enemy of the state   and he\\nentertains the serious hope that an universal brotherhood may take the\\nplace of private interests—an aspiration which   although not justified\\nby experience   has possessed many noble minds   on the other hand   there\\nis no sentiment or imagination in the connections which men and women\\nare supposed by him to form   human beings return to the level of the\\nanimals   neither exalting to heaven   nor yet abusing the natural\\ninstincts   all that world of poetry and fancy which the passion of love\\nhas called forth in modern literature and romance would have been\\nbanished by plato   the arrangements of marriage in the republic are\\ndirected to one object—the improvement of the race   in successive\\ngenerations a great development both of bodily and mental qualities\\nmight be possible   the analogy of animals tends to show that mankind\\ncan within certain limits receive a change of nature   and as in animals\\nwe should commonly choose the best for breeding   and destroy the\\nothers   so there must be a selection made of the human beings whose\\nlives are worthy to be preserved  \\n\\nwe start back horrified from this platonic ideal   in the belief   first  \\nthat the higher feelings of humanity are far too strong to be crushed\\nout   secondly   that if the plan could be carried into execution we\\nshould be poorly recompensed by improvements in the breed for the loss\\nof the best things in life   the greatest regard for the weakest and\\nmeanest of human beings—the infant   the criminal   the insane   the\\nidiot   truly seems to us one of the noblest results of christianity   we\\nhave learned   though as yet imperfectly   that the individual man has an\\nendless value in the sight of god   and that we honour him when we\\nhonour the darkened and disfigured image of him   laws     this is the\\nlesson which christ taught in a parable when he said     their angels do\\nalways behold the face of my father which is in heaven     such lessons\\nare only partially realized in any age   they were foreign to the age of\\nplato   as they have very different degrees of strength in different\\ncountries or ages of the christian world   to the greek the family was a\\nreligious and customary institution binding the members together by a\\ntie inferior in strength to that of friendship   and having a less\\nsolemn and sacred sound than that of country   the relationship which\\nexisted on the lower level of custom   plato imagined that he was\\nraising to the higher level of nature and reason   while from the modern\\nand christian point of view we regard him as sanctioning murder and\\ndestroying the first principles of morality  \\n\\nthe great error in these and similar speculations is that the\\ndifference between man and the animals is forgotten in them   the human\\nbeing is regarded with the eye of a dog   or bird  fancier   or at best of\\na slave  owner   the higher or human qualities are left out   the breeder\\nof animals aims chiefly at size or speed or strength   in a few cases at\\ncourage or temper   most often the fitness of the animal for food is the\\ngreat desideratum   but mankind are not bred to be eaten   nor yet for\\ntheir superiority in fighting or in running or in drawing carts  \\nneither does the improvement of the human race consist merely in the\\nincrease of the bones and flesh   but in the growth and enlightenment of\\nthe mind   hence there must be   a marriage of true minds   as well as of\\nbodies   of imagination and reason as well as of lusts and instincts  \\nmen and women without feeling or imagination are justly called brutes  \\nyet plato takes away these qualities and puts nothing in their place  \\nnot even the desire of a noble offspring   since parents are not to know\\ntheir own children   the most important transaction of social life   he\\nwho is the idealist philosopher converts into the most brutal   for the\\npair are to have no relation to one another   except at the hymeneal\\nfestival   their children are not theirs   but the state  s   nor is any\\ntie of affection to unite them   yet here the analogy of the animals\\nmight have saved plato from a gigantic error   if he had   not lost sight\\nof his own illustration     for the   nobler sort of birds and beasts  \\nnourish and protect their offspring and are faithful to one another  \\n\\nan eminent physiologist thinks it worth while   to try and place life on\\na physical basis     but should not life rest on the moral rather than\\nupon the physical   the higher comes first   then the lower   first the\\nhuman and rational   afterwards the animal   yet they are not absolutely\\ndivided   and in times of sickness or moments of self  indulgence they\\nseem to be only different aspects of a common human nature which\\nincludes them both   neither is the moral the limit of the physical   but\\nthe expansion and enlargement of it  —the highest form which the\\nphysical is capable of receiving   as plato would say   the body does not\\ntake care of the body   and still less of the mind   but the mind takes\\ncare of both   in all human action not that which is common to man and\\nthe animals is the characteristic element   but that which distinguishes\\nhim from them   even if we admit the physical basis   and resolve all\\nvirtue into health of body   la facon que notre sang circule     still on\\nmerely physical grounds we must come back to ideas   mind and reason and\\nduty and conscience   under these or other names   are always\\nreappearing   there cannot be health of body without health of mind   nor\\nhealth of mind without the sense of duty and the love of truth   charm    \\n\\nthat the greatest of ancient philosophers should in his regulations\\nabout marriage have fallen into the error of separating body and mind  \\ndoes indeed appear surprising   yet the wonder is not so much that plato\\nshould have entertained ideas of morality which to our own age are\\nrevolting   but that he should have contradicted himself to an extent\\nwhich is hardly credible   falling in an instant from the heaven of\\nidealism into the crudest animalism   rejoicing in the newly found gift\\nof reflection   he appears to have thought out a subject about which he\\nhad better have followed the enlightened feeling of his own age   the\\ngeneral sentiment of hellas was opposed to his monstrous fancy   the old\\npoets   and in later time the tragedians   showed no want of respect for\\nthe family   on which much of their religion was based   but the example\\nof sparta   and perhaps in some degree the tendency to defy public\\nopinion   seems to have misled him   he will make one family out of all\\nthe families of the state   he will select the finest specimens of men\\nand women and breed from these only  \\n\\nyet because the illusion is always returning   for the animal part of\\nhuman nature will from time to time assert itself in the disguise of\\nphilosophy as well as of poetry     and also because any departure from\\nestablished morality   even where this is not intended   is apt to be\\nunsettling   it may be worth while to draw out a little more at length\\nthe objections to the platonic marriage   in the first place   history\\nshows that wherever polygamy has been largely allowed the race has\\ndeteriorated   one man to one woman is the law of god and nature   nearly\\nall the civilized peoples of the world at some period before the age of\\nwritten records   have become monogamists   and the step when once taken\\nhas never been retraced   the exceptions occurring among brahmins or\\nmahometans or the ancient persians   are of that sort which may be said\\nto prove the rule   the connexions formed between superior and inferior\\nraces hardly ever produce a noble offspring   because they are\\nlicentious   and because the children in such cases usually despise the\\nmother and are neglected by the father who is ashamed of them  \\nbarbarous nations when they are introduced by europeans to vice die\\nout   polygamist

 by such unmistakable evidence is\\nthe authority of morality asserted in the relations of the sexes   and\\nso many more elements enter into this   mystery   than are dreamed of by\\nplato and some

 or even of the ancient germans   are wholly unknown to us  \\n\\nsuch speculations are apt to be unsettling   because they seem to show\\nthat an institution which was thought to be a revelation from heaven  \\nis only the growth of history and experience   we ask what is the origin\\nof marriage   and we are told that like the right of property   after\\nmany wars and contests   it has gradually arisen out of the selfishness\\nof barbarians   we stand face to face with human nature in its primitive\\nnakedness   we are compelled to accept   not the highest   but the lowest\\naccount of the origin of human society   but on the other hand we may\\ntruly say that every step in human progress has been in the same\\ndirection   and that in the course of ages the idea of marriage and of\\nthe family has been more and more defined and consecrated   the\\ncivilized east is immeasurably in advance of any savage tribes   the\\ngreeks and romans have improved upon the east   the christian nations\\nhave been stricter in their views of the marriage relation than any of\\nthe ancients   in this as in so many other things   instead of looking\\nback with regret to the past   we should look forward with hope to the\\nfuture   we must consecrate that which we believe to be the most holy  \\nand that   which is the most holy will be the most useful     there is\\nmore reason for maintaining the sacredness of the marriage tie   when we\\nsee the benefit of it   than when we only felt a vague religious horror\\nabout the violation of it   but in all times of transition   when\\nestablished beliefs are being undermined   there is a danger that in the\\npassage from the old to the new we may insensibly let go the moral\\nprinciple   finding an excuse for listening to the voice of passion in\\nthe uncertainty of knowledge   or the fluctuations of opinion   and there\\nare many persons in our own day who   enlightened by the study of\\nanthropology   and fascinated by what is new and strange   some using the\\nlanguage of fear   others of hope   are inclined to believe that a time\\nwill come when through the self  assertion of women   or the rebellious\\nspirit of children   by the analysis of human relations   or by the force\\nof outward circumstances   the ties of family life may be broken or\\ngreatly relaxed   they point to societies in america and elsewhere which\\ntend to show that the destruction of the family need not necessarily\\ninvolve the overthrow of all morality   wherever we may think of such\\nspeculations   we can hardly deny that they have been more rife in this\\ngeneration than in any other   and whither they are tending   who can\\npredict  \\n\\nto the doubts and queries raised by these   social reformers   respecting\\nthe relation of the sexes and the moral nature of man   there is a\\nsufficient answer   if any is needed   the difference about them and us\\nis really one of fact   they are speaking of man as they wish or fancy\\nhim to be   but we are speaking of him as he is   they isolate the animal\\npart of his nature   we regard him as a creature having many sides   or\\naspects   moving between good and evil   striving to rise above himself\\nand to become   a little lower than the angels     we also   to use a\\nplatonic formula   are not ignorant of the dissatisfactions and\\nincompatibilities of family life   of the meannesses of trade   of the\\nflatteries of one class of society by another   of the impediments which\\nthe family throws in the way of lofty aims and aspirations   but we are\\nconscious that there are evils and dangers in the background greater\\nstill   which are not appreciated   because they are either concealed or\\nsuppressed   what a condition of man would that be   in which human\\npassions were controlled by no authority   divine or human   in which\\nthere was no shame or decency   no higher affection overcoming or\\nsanctifying the natural instincts   but simply a rule of health   is it\\nfor this that we are asked to throw away the civilization which is the\\ngrowth of ages  \\n\\nfor strength and health are not the only qualities to be desired   there\\nare the more important considerations of mind and character and soul  \\nwe know how human nature may be degraded   we do not know how by\\nartificial means any improvement in the breed can be effected   the\\nproblem is a complex one   for if we go back only four steps   and these\\nat least enter into the composition of a child     there are commonly\\nthirty progenitors to be taken into account   many curious facts   rarely\\nadmitting of proof   are told us respecting the inheritance of disease\\nor character from a remote ancestor   we can trace the physical\\nresemblances of parents and children in the same family—\\n\\n  sic oculos   sic ille manus   sic ora ferebat    \\n\\nbut scarcely less often the differences which distinguish children both\\nfrom their parents and from one another   we are told of similar mental\\npeculiarities running in families   and again of a tendency   as in the\\nanimals   to revert to a common or original stock   but we have a\\ndifficulty in distinguishing what is a true inheritance of genius or\\nother qualities   and what is mere imitation or the result of similar\\ncircumstances   great men and great women have rarely had great fathers\\nand mothers   nothing that we know of in the circumstances of their\\nbirth or lineage will explain their appearance   of the english poets of\\nthe last and two preceding centuries scarcely a descendant\\nremains  —none have ever been distinguished   so deeply has nature hidden\\nher secret   and so ridiculous is the fancy which has been entertained\\nby some that we might in time by suitable marriage arrangements or   as\\nplato would have said     by an ingenious system of lots     produce a\\nshakespeare or a milton   even supposing that we could breed men having\\nthe tenacity of bulldogs   or   like the spartans     lacking the wit to\\nrun away in battle     would the world be any the better   many of the\\nnoblest specimens of the human race have been among the weakest\\nphysically   tyrtaeus or aesop   or our own newton   would have been\\nexposed at sparta   and some of the fairest and strongest men and women\\nhave been among the wickedest and worst   not by the platonic device of\\nuniting the strong and fair with the strong and fair   regardless of\\nsentiment and morality   nor yet by his other device of combining\\ndissimilar natures   statesman     have mankind gradually passed from the\\nbrutality and licentiousness of primitive marriage to marriage\\nchristian and civilized  \\n\\nfew persons would deny that we bring into the world an inheritance of\\nmental and physical qualities derived first from our parents   or\\nthrough them from some remoter ancestor   secondly from our race  \\nthirdly from the general condition of mankind into which we are born  \\nnothing is commoner than the remark   that   so and so is like his father\\nor his uncle     and an aged person may not unfrequently note a\\nresemblance in a youth to a long  forgotten ancestor   observing that\\n  nature sometimes skips a generation     it may be true also   that if we\\nknew more about our ancestors   these similarities would be even more\\nstriking to us   admitting the facts which are thus described in a\\npopular way   we may however remark that there is no method of\\ndifference by which they can be defined or estimated   and that they\\nconstitute only a small part of each individual   the doctrine of\\nheredity may seem to take out of our hands the conduct of our own\\nlives   but it is the idea   not the fact   which is really terrible to\\nus   for what we have received from our ancestors is only a fraction of\\nwhat we are   or may become   the knowledge that drunkenness or insanity\\nhas been prevalent in a family may be the best safeguard against their\\nrecurrence in a future generation   the parent will be most awake to the\\nvices or diseases in his child of which he is most sensible within\\nhimself   the whole of life may be directed to their prevention or cure  \\nthe traces of consumption may become fainter   or be wholly effaced   the\\ninherent tendency to vice or crime may be eradicated   and so heredity  \\nfrom being a curse   may become a blessing   we acknowledge that in the\\nmatter of our birth   as in our nature generally   there are previous\\ncircumstances which affect us   but upon this platform of circumstances\\nor within this wall of necessity   we have still the power of creating a\\nlife for ourselves by the informing energy of the human will  \\n\\nthere is another aspect of the marriage question to which plato is a\\nstranger   all the children born in his state are foundlings   it never\\noccurred to him that the greater part of them   according to universal\\nexperience   would have perished   for children can only be brought up in\\nfamilies   there is a subtle sympathy between the mother and the child\\nwhich cannot be supplied by other mothers   or by   strong nurses one or\\nmore     laws     if plato  s   pen   was as fatal as the creches of paris   or\\nthe foundling hospital of dublin   more than nine  tenths of his children\\nwould have perished   there would have been no need to expose or put out\\nof the way the weaklier children   for they would have died of\\nthemselves   so emphatically does nature protest against the destruction\\nof the family  \\n\\nwhat plato had heard or seen of sparta was applied by him in a mistaken\\nway to his ideal commonwealth   he probably observed that both the\\nspartan men and women were superior in form and strength to the other\\ngreeks   and this superiority he was disposed to attribute to the laws\\nand customs relating to marriage   he did not consider that the desire\\nof a noble offspring was a passion among the spartans   or that their\\nphysical superiority was to be attributed chiefly   not to their\\nmarriage customs   but to their temperance and training   he did not\\nreflect that sparta was great   not in consequence of the relaxation of\\nmorality   but in spite of it   by virtue of a political principle\\nstronger far than existed in any other grecian state   least of all did\\nhe observe that sparta did not really produce the finest specimens of\\nthe greek race   the genius   the political inspiration of athens   the\\nlove of liberty—all that has made greece famous with posterity   were\\nwanting among the spartans   they had no themistocles   or pericles   or\\naeschylus   or sophocles   or socrates   or plato   the individual was not\\nallowed to appear above the state   the laws were fixed   and he had no\\nbusiness to alter or reform them   yet whence has the progress of cities\\nand nations arisen   if not from remarkable individuals   coming into the\\nworld we know not how   and from causes over which we have no control  \\nsomething too much may have been said in modern times of the value of\\nindividuality   but we can hardly condemn too strongly a system which  \\ninstead of fostering the scattered seeds or sparks of genius and\\ncharacter   tends to smother and extinguish them  \\n\\nstill   while condemning plato   we must acknowledge that neither\\nchristianity   nor any other form of religion and society   has hitherto\\nbeen able to cope with this most difficult of social problems   and that\\nthe side from which plato regarded it is that from which we turn away  \\npopulation is the most untameable force in the political and social\\nworld   do we not find   especially in large cities   that the greatest\\nhindrance to the amelioration of the poor is their improvidence in\\nmarriage  —a small fault truly   if not involving endless consequences  \\nthere are whole countries too   such as india   or   nearer home   ireland  \\nin which a right solution of the marriage question seems to lie at the\\nfoundation of the happiness of the community   there are too many people\\non a given space   or they marry too early and bring into the world a\\nsickly and half  developed offspring   or owing to the very conditions of\\ntheir existence   they become emaciated and hand on a similar life to\\ntheir descendants   but who can oppose the voice of prudence to the\\n  mightiest passions of mankind     laws     especially when they have been\\nlicensed by custom and religion   in addition to the influences of\\neducation   we seem to require some new principles of right and wrong in\\nthese matters   some force of opinion   which may indeed be already heard\\nwhispering in private   but has never affected the moral sentiments of\\nmankind in general   we unavoidably lose sight of the principle of\\nutility   just in that action of our lives in which we have the most\\nneed of it   the influences which we can bring to bear upon this\\nquestion are chiefly indirect   in a generation or two   education  \\nemigration   improvements in agriculture and manufactures   may have\\nprovided the solution   the state physician hardly likes to probe the\\nwound   it is beyond his art   a matter which he cannot safely let alone  \\nbut which he dare not touch  \\n\\n  we do but skin and film the ulcerous place    \\n\\nwhen again in private life we see a whole family one by one dropping\\ninto the grave under the ate of some inherited malady   and the parents\\nperhaps surviving them   do our minds ever go back silently to that day\\ntwenty  five or thirty years before on which under the fairest auspices  \\namid the rejoicings of friends and acquaintances   a bride and\\nbridegroom joined hands with one another   in making such a reflection\\nwe are not opposing physical considerations to moral   but moral to\\nphysical   we are seeking to make the voice of reason heard   which\\ndrives us back from the extravagance of sentimentalism on common sense  \\nthe late dr   combe is said by his biographer to have resisted the\\ntemptation to marriage   because he knew that he was subject to\\nhereditary consumption   one who deserved to be called a man of genius  \\na friend of my youth   was in the habit of wearing a black ribbon on his\\nwrist   in order to remind him that   being liable to outbreaks of\\ninsanity   he must not give way to the natural impulses of affection   he\\ndied unmarried in a lunatic asylum   these two little facts suggest the\\nreflection that a very few persons have done from a sense of duty what\\nthe rest of mankind ought to have done under like circumstances   if\\nthey had allowed themselves to think of all the misery which they were\\nabout to bring into the world   if we could prevent such marriages\\nwithout any violation of feeling or propriety   we clearly ought   and\\nthe prohibition in the course of time would be protected by a   horror\\nnaturalis   similar to that which   in all civilized ages and countries  \\nhas prevented the marriage of near relations by blood   mankind would\\nhave been the happier   if some things which are now allowed had from\\nthe beginning been denied to them   if the sanction of religion could\\nhave prohibited practices inimical to health   if sanitary principles\\ncould in early ages have been invested with a superstitious awe   but  \\nliving as we do far on in the world  s history   we are no longer able to\\nstamp at once with the impress of religion a new prohibition   a free\\nagent cannot have his fancies regulated by law   and the execution of\\nthe law would be rendered impossible   owing to the uncertainty of the\\ncases in which marriage was to be forbidden   who can weigh virtue   or\\neven fortune against health   or moral and mental qualities against\\nbodily   who can measure probabilities against certainties   there has\\nbeen some good as well as evil in the discipline of suffering   and\\nthere are diseases   such as consumption   which have exercised a\\nrefining and softening influence on the character   youth is too\\ninexperienced to balance such nice considerations   parents do not often\\nthink of them   or think of them too late   they are at a distance and\\nmay probably be averted   change of place   a new state of life   the\\ninterests of a home may be the cure of them   so persons vainly reason\\nwhen their minds are already made up and their fortunes irrevocably\\nlinked together   nor is there any ground for supposing that marriages\\nare to any great extent influenced by reflections of this sort   which\\nseem unable to make any head against the irresistible impulse of\\nindividual attachment  \\n\\nlastly   no one can have observed the first rising flood of the passions\\nin youth   the difficulty of regulating them   and the effects on the\\nwhole mind and nature which follow from them   the stimulus which is\\ngiven to them by the imagination   without feeling that there is\\nsomething unsatisfactory in our method of treating them   that the most\\nimportant influence on human life should be wholly left to chance or\\nshrouded in mystery   and instead of being disciplined or understood  \\nshould be required to conform only to an external standard of\\npropriety—cannot be regarded by the philosopher as a safe or\\nsatisfactory condition of human things   and still those who have the\\ncharge of youth may find a way by watchfulness   by affection   by the\\nmanliness and innocence of their own lives   by occasional hints   by\\ngeneral admonitions which every one can apply for himself   to mitigate\\nthis terrible evil which eats out the heart of individuals and corrupts\\nthe moral sentiments of nations   in no duty towards others is there\\nmore need of reticence and self  restraint   so great is the danger lest\\nhe who would be the counsellor of another should reveal the secret\\nprematurely   lest he should get another too much into his power   or fix\\nthe passing impression of evil by demanding the confession of it  \\n\\nnor is plato wrong in asserting that family attachments may interfere\\nwith higher aims   if there have been some who   to party gave up what\\nwas meant for mankind     there have certainly been others who to family\\ngave up what was meant for mankind or for their country   the cares of\\nchildren   the necessity of procuring money for their support   the\\nflatteries of the rich by the poor   the exclusiveness of caste   the\\npride of birth or wealth   the tendency of family life to divert men\\nfrom the pursuit of the ideal or the heroic   are as lowering in our own\\nage as in that of plato   and if we prefer to look at the gentle\\ninfluences of home   the development of the affections   the amenities of\\nsociety   the devotion of one member of a family for the good of the\\nothers   which form one side of the picture   we must not quarrel with\\nhim   or perhaps ought rather to be grateful to him   for having\\npresented to us the reverse   without attempting to defend plato on\\ngrounds of morality   we may allow that there is an aspect of the world\\nwhich has not unnaturally led him into error  \\n\\nwe hardly appreciate the power which the idea of the state   like all\\nother abstract ideas   exercised over the mind of plato   to us the state\\nseems to be built up out of the family   or sometimes to be the\\nframework in which family and social life is contained   but to plato in\\nhis present mood of mind the family is only a disturbing influence\\nwhich   instead of filling up   tends to disarrange the higher unity of\\nthe state   no organization is needed except a political   which  \\nregarded from another point of view   is a military one   the state is\\nall  sufficing for the wants of man   and   like the idea of the church in\\nlater ages   absorbs all other desires and affections   in time of war\\nthe thousand citizens are to stand like a rampart impregnable against\\nthe world or the persian host   in time of peace the preparation for war\\nand their duties to the state   which are also their duties to one\\nanother   take up their whole life and time   the only other interest\\nwhich is allowed to them besides that of war   is the interest of\\nphilosophy   when they are too old to be soldiers they are to retire\\nfrom active life and to have a second novitiate of study and\\ncontemplation   there is an element of monasticism even in plato  s\\ncommunism   if he could have done without children   he might have\\nconverted his republic into a religious order   neither in the laws  \\nwhen the daylight of common sense breaks in upon him   does he retract\\nhis error   in the state of which he would be the founder   there is no\\nmarrying or giving in marriage   but because of the infirmity of\\nmankind   he condescends to allow the law of nature to prevail  \\n\\n  c   but plato has an equal   or   in his own estimation   even greater\\nparadox in reserve   which is summed up in the famous text     until kings\\nare philosophers or philosophers are kings   cities will never cease\\nfrom ill     and by philosophers he explains himself to mean those who\\nare capable of apprehending ideas   especially the idea of good   to the\\nattainment of this higher knowledge the second education is directed  \\nthrough a process of training which has already made them good citizens\\nthey are now to be made good legislators   we find with some surprise\\n  not unlike the feeling which aristotle in a well  known passage\\ndescribes the hearers of plato  s lectures as experiencing   when they\\nwent to a discourse on the idea of good   expecting to be instructed in\\nmoral truths   and received instead of them arithmetical and\\nmathematical formulae   that plato does not propose for his future\\nlegislators any study of finance or law or military tactics   but only\\nof abstract mathematics   as a preparation for the still more abstract\\nconception of good   we ask   with aristotle   what is the use of a man\\nknowing the idea of good   if he does not know what is good for this\\nindividual   this state   this condition of society   we cannot understand\\nhow plato  s legislators or guardians are to be fitted for their work of\\nstatesmen by the study of the five mathematical sciences   we vainly\\nsearch in plato  s own writings for any explanation of this seeming\\nabsurdity  \\n\\nthe discovery of a great metaphysical conception seems to ravish the\\nmind with a prophetic consciousness which takes away the power of\\nestimating its value   no metaphysical enquirer has ever fairly\\ncriticised his own speculations   in his own judgment they have been\\nabove criticism   nor has he understood that what to him seemed to be\\nabsolute truth may reappear in the next generation as a form of logic\\nor an instrument of thought   and posterity have also sometimes equally\\nmisapprehended the real value of his speculations   they appear to them\\nto have contributed nothing to the stock of human knowledge   the idea\\nof good is apt to be regarded by the modern thinker as an unmeaning\\nabstraction   but he forgets that this abstraction is waiting ready for\\nuse   and will hereafter be filled up by the divisions of knowledge  \\nwhen mankind do not as yet know that the world is subject to law   the\\nintroduction of the mere conception of law or design or final cause  \\nand the far  off anticipation of the harmony of knowledge   are great\\nsteps onward   even the crude generalization of the unity of all things\\nleads men to view the world with different eyes   and may easily affect\\ntheir conception of human life and of politics   and also their own\\nconduct and character   tim     we can imagine how a great mind like that\\nof pericles might derive elevation from his intercourse with anaxagoras\\n  phaedr       to be struggling towards a higher but unattainable\\nconception is a more favourable intellectual condition than to rest\\nsatisfied in a narrow portion of ascertained fact   and the earlier  \\nwhich have sometimes been the greater ideas of science   are often lost\\nsight of at a later period   how rarely can we say of any modern\\nenquirer in the magnificent language of plato   that   he is the\\nspectator of all time and of all existence    \\n\\nnor is there anything unnatural in the hasty application of these vast\\nmetaphysical conceptions to practical and political life   in the first\\nenthusiasm of ideas men are apt to see them everywhere   and to apply\\nthem in the most remote sphere   they do not understand that the\\nexperience of ages is required to enable them to fill up   the\\nintermediate axioms     plato himself seems to have imagined that the\\ntruths of psychology   like those of astronomy and harmonics   would be\\narrived at by a process of deduction   and that the method which he has\\npursued in the fourth book   of inferring them from experience and the\\nuse of language   was imperfect and only provisional   but when   after\\nhaving arrived at the idea of good   which is the end of the science of\\ndialectic   he is asked   what is the nature   and what are the divisions\\nof the science   he refuses to answer   as if intending by the refusal to\\nintimate that the state of knowledge which then existed was not such as\\nwould allow the philosopher to enter into his final rest   the previous\\nsciences must first be studied   and will   we may add   continue to be\\nstudied tell the end of time   although in a sense different from any\\nwhich plato could have conceived   but we may observe   that while he is\\naware of the vacancy of his own ideal   he is full of enthusiasm in the\\ncontemplation of it   looking into the orb of light   he sees nothing  \\nbut he is warmed and elevated   the hebrew prophet believed that faith\\nin god would enable him to govern the world   the greek philosopher\\nimagined that contemplation of the good would make a legislator   there\\nis as much to be filled up in the one case as in the other   and the one\\nmode of conception is to the israelite what the other is to the greek  \\nboth find a repose in a divine perfection   which   whether in a more\\npersonal or impersonal form   exists without them and independently of\\nthem   as well as within them  \\n\\nthere is no mention of the idea of good in the timaeus   nor of the\\ndivine creator of the world in the republic   and we are naturally led\\nto ask in what relation they stand to one another   is god above or\\nbelow the idea of good   or is the idea of good another mode of\\nconceiving god   the latter appears to be the truer answer   to the greek\\nphilosopher the perfection and unity of god was a far higher conception\\nthan his personality   which he hardly found a word to express   and\\nwhich to him would have seemed to be borrowed from mythology   to the\\nchristian   on the other hand   or to the modern thinker in general   it\\nis difficult   if not impossible   to attach reality to what he terms\\nmere abstraction   while to plato this very abstraction is the truest\\nand most real of all things   hence   from a difference in forms of\\nthought   plato appears to be resting on a creation of his own mind\\nonly   but if we may be allowed to paraphrase the idea of good by the\\nwords   intelligent principle of law and order in the universe  \\nembracing equally man and nature     we begin to find a meeting  point\\nbetween him and ourselves  \\n\\nthe question whether the ruler or statesman should be a philosopher is\\none that has not lost interest in modern times   in most countries of\\neurope and asia there has been some one in the course of ages who has\\ntruly united the power of command with the power of thought and\\nreflection   as there have been also many false combinations of these\\nqualities   some kind of speculative power is necessary both in\\npractical and political life   like the rhetorician in the phaedrus   men\\nrequire to have a conception of the varieties of human character   and\\nto be raised on great occasions above the commonplaces of ordinary\\nlife   yet the idea of the philosopher  statesman has never been popular\\nwith the mass of mankind   partly because he cannot take the world into\\nhis confidence or make them understand the motives from which he acts  \\nand also because they are jealous of a power which they do not\\nunderstand   the revolution which human nature desires to effect step by\\nstep in many ages is likely to be precipitated by him in a single year\\nor life   they are afraid that in the pursuit of his greater aims he may\\ndisregard the common feelings of humanity   he is too apt to be looking\\ninto the distant future or back into the remote past   and unable to see\\nactions or events which   to use an expression of plato  s   are tumbling\\nout at his feet     besides   as plato would say   there are other\\ncorruptions of these philosophical statesmen   either   the native hue of\\nresolution is sicklied o  er with the pale cast of thought     and at the\\nmoment when action above all things is required he is undecided   or\\ngeneral principles are enunciated by him in order to cover some change\\nof policy   or his ignorance of the world has made him more easily fall\\na prey to the arts of others   or in some cases he has been converted\\ninto a courtier   who enjoys the luxury of holding liberal opinions   but\\nwas never known to perform a liberal action   no wonder that mankind\\nhave been in the habit of calling statesmen of this class pedants  \\nsophisters   doctrinaires   visionaries   for   as we may be allowed to\\nsay   a little parodying the words of plato     they have seen bad\\nimitations of the philosopher  statesman     but a man in whom the power\\nof thought and action are perfectly balanced   equal to the present  \\nreaching forward to the future     such a one     ruling in a\\nconstitutional state     they have never seen    \\n\\nbut as the philosopher is apt to fail in the routine of political life  \\nso the ordinary statesman is also apt to fail in extraordinary crises  \\nwhen the face of the world is beginning to alter   and thunder is heard\\nin the distance   he is still guided by his old maxims   and is the slave\\nof his inveterate party prejudices   he cannot perceive the signs of the\\ntimes   instead of looking forward he looks back   he learns nothing and\\nforgets nothing   with   wise saws and modern instances   he would stem\\nthe rising tide of revolution   he lives more and more within the circle\\nof his own party   as the world without him becomes stronger   this seems\\nto be the reason why the old order of things makes so poor a figure\\nwhen confronted with the new   why churches can never reform   why most\\npolitical changes are made blindly and convulsively   the great crises\\nin the history of nations have often been met by an ecclesiastical\\npositiveness   and a more obstinate reassertion of principles which have\\nlost their hold upon a nation   the fixed ideas of a reactionary\\nstatesman may be compared to madness   they grow upon him   and he\\nbecomes possessed by them   no judgement of others is ever admitted by\\nhim to be weighed in the balance against his own  \\n\\n  d   plato   labouring under what   to modern readers   appears to have\\nbeen a confusion of ideas   assimilates the state to the individual   and\\nfails to distinguish ethics from politics   he thinks that to be most of\\na state which is most like one man   and in which the citizens have the\\ngreatest uniformity of character   he does not see that the analogy is\\npartly fallacious   and that the will or character of a state or nation\\nis really the balance or rather the surplus of individual wills   which\\nare limited by the condition of having to act in common   the movement\\nof a body of men can never have the pliancy or facility of a single\\nman   the freedom of the individual   which is always limited   becomes\\nstill more straitened when transferred to a nation   the powers of\\naction and feeling are necessarily weaker and more balanced when they\\nare diffused through a community   whence arises the often discussed\\nquestion     can a nation   like an individual   have a conscience     we\\nhesitate to say that the characters of nations are nothing more than\\nthe sum of the characters of the individuals who compose them   because\\nthere may be tendencies in individuals which react upon one another   a\\nwhole nation may be wiser than any one man in it   or may be animated by\\nsome common opinion or feeling which could not equally have affected\\nthe mind of a single person   or may have been inspired by a leader of\\ngenius to perform acts more than human   plato does not appear to have\\nanalysed the complications which arise out of the collective action of\\nmankind   neither is he capable of seeing that analogies   though\\nspecious as arguments   may often have no foundation in fact   or of\\ndistinguishing between what is intelligible or vividly present to the\\nmind   and what is true   in this respect he is far below aristotle   who\\nis comparatively seldom imposed upon by false analogies   he cannot\\ndisentangle the arts from the virtues—at least he is always arguing\\nfrom one to the other   his notion of music is transferred from harmony\\nof sounds to harmony of life   in this he is assisted by the ambiguities\\nof language as well as by the prevalence of pythagorean notions   and\\nhaving once assimilated the state to the individual   he imagines that\\nhe will find the succession of states paralleled in the lives of\\nindividuals  \\n\\nstill   through this fallacious medium   a real enlargement of ideas is\\nattained   when the virtues as yet presented no distinct conception to\\nthe mind   a great advance was made by the comparison of them with the\\narts   for virtue is partly art   and has an outward form as well as an\\ninward principle   the harmony of music affords a lively image of the\\nharmonies of the world and of human life   and may be regarded as a\\nsplendid illustration which was naturally mistaken for a real analogy  \\nin the same way the identification of ethics with politics has a\\ntendency to give definiteness to ethics   and also to elevate and\\nennoble men  s notions of the aims of government and of the duties of\\ncitizens   for ethics from one point of view may be conceived as an\\nidealized law and politics   and politics   as ethics reduced to the\\nconditions of human society   there have been evils which have arisen\\nout of the attempt to identify them   and this has led to the separation\\nor antagonism of them   which has been introduced by modern political\\nwriters   but we may likewise feel that something has been lost in their\\nseparation   and that the ancient philosophers who estimated the moral\\nand intellectual wellbeing of mankind first   and the wealth of nations\\nand individuals second   may have a salutary influence on the\\nspeculations of modern times   many political maxims originate in a\\nreaction against an opposite error   and when the errors against which\\nthey were directed have passed away   they in turn become errors  \\n\\n3   plato  s views of education are in several respects remarkable   like\\nthe rest of the republic they are partly greek and partly ideal  \\nbeginning with the ordinary curriculum of the greek youth   and\\nextending to after  life   plato is the first writer who distinctly says\\nthat education is to comprehend the whole of life   and to be a\\npreparation for another in which education begins again   this is the\\ncontinuous thread which runs through the republic   and which more than\\nany other of his ideas admits of an application to modern life  \\n\\nhe has long given up the notion that virtue cannot be taught   and he is\\ndisposed to modify the thesis of the protagoras   that the virtues are\\none and not many   he is not unwilling to admit the sensible world into\\nhis scheme of truth   nor does he assert in the republic the\\ninvoluntariness of vice   which is maintained by him in the timaeus  \\nsophist   and laws   protag     apol     gorg       nor do the so  called\\nplatonic ideas recovered from a former state of existence affect his\\ntheory of mental improvement   still we observe in him the remains of\\nthe old socratic doctrine   that true knowledge must be elicited from\\nwithin   and is to be sought for in ideas   not in particulars of sense  \\neducation   as he says   will implant a principle of intelligence which\\nis better than ten thousand eyes   the paradox that the virtues are one  \\nand the kindred notion that all virtue is knowledge   are not entirely\\nrenounced   the first is seen in the supremacy given to justice over the\\nrest   the second in the tendency to absorb the moral virtues in the\\nintellectual   and to centre all goodness in the contemplation of the\\nidea of good   the world of sense is still depreciated and identified\\nwith opinion   though admitted to be a shadow of the true   in the\\nrepublic he is evidently impressed with the conviction that vice arises\\nchiefly from ignorance and may be cured by education   the multitude are\\nhardly to be deemed responsible for what they do   a faint allusion to\\nthe doctrine of reminiscence occurs in the tenth book   but plato  s\\nviews of education have no more real connection with a previous state\\nof existence than our own   he only proposes to elicit from the mind\\nthat which is there already   education is represented by him   not as\\nthe filling of a vessel   but as the turning the eye of the soul towards\\nthe light  \\n\\nhe treats first of music or literature   which he divides into true and\\nfalse   and then goes on to gymnastics   of infancy in the republic he\\ntakes no notice   though in the laws he gives sage counsels about the\\nnursing of children and the management of the mothers   and would have\\nan education which is even prior to birth   but in the republic he\\nbegins with the age at which the child is capable of receiving ideas  \\nand boldly asserts   in language which sounds paradoxical to modern\\nears   that he must be taught the false before he can learn the true  \\nthe modern and ancient philosophical world are not agreed about truth\\nand falsehood   the one identifies truth almost exclusively with fact  \\nthe other with ideas   this is the difference between ourselves and\\nplato   which is   however   partly a difference of words   for we too\\nshould admit that a child must receive many lessons which he\\nimperfectly understands   he must be taught some things in a figure\\nonly   some too which he can hardly be expected to believe when he grows\\nolder   but we should limit the use of fiction by the necessity of the\\ncase   plato would draw the line differently   according to him the aim\\nof early education is not truth as a matter of fact   but truth as a\\nmatter of principle   the child is to be taught first simple religious\\ntruths   and then simple moral truths   and insensibly to learn the\\nlesson of good manners and good taste   he would make an entire\\nreformation of the old mythology   like xenophanes and heracleitus he is\\nsensible of the deep chasm which separates his own age from homer and\\nhesiod   whom he quotes and invests with an imaginary authority   but\\nonly for his own purposes   the lusts and treacheries of the gods are to\\nbe banished   the terrors of the world below are to be dispelled   the\\nmisbehaviour of the homeric heroes is not to be a model for youth   but\\nthere is another strain heard in homer which may teach our youth\\nendurance   and something may be learnt in medicine from the simple\\npractice of the homeric age   the principles on which religion is to be\\nbased are two only   first   that god is true   secondly   that he is good  \\nmodern and christian writers have often fallen short of these   they can\\nhardly be said to have gone beyond them  \\n\\nthe young are to be brought up in happy surroundings   out of the way of\\nsights or sounds which may hurt the character or vitiate the taste  \\nthey are to live in an atmosphere of health   the breeze is always to be\\nwafting to them the impressions of truth and goodness   could such an\\neducation be realized   or if our modern religious education could be\\nbound up with truth and virtue and good manners and good taste   that\\nwould be the best hope of human improvement   plato   like ourselves   is\\nlooking forward to changes in the moral and religious world   and is\\npreparing for them   he recognizes the danger of unsettling young men  s\\nminds by sudden changes of laws and principles   by destroying the\\nsacredness of one set of ideas when there is nothing else to take their\\nplace   he is afraid too of the influence of the drama   on the ground\\nthat it encourages false sentiment   and therefore he would not have his\\nchildren taken to the theatre   he thinks that the effect on the\\nspectators is bad   and on the actors still worse   his idea of education\\nis that of harmonious growth   in which are insensibly learnt the\\nlessons of temperance and endurance   and the body and mind develope in\\nequal proportions   the first principle which runs through all art and\\nnature is simplicity   this also is to be the rule of human life  \\n\\nthe second stage of education is gymnastic   which answers to the period\\nof muscular growth and development   the simplicity which is enforced in\\nmusic is extended to gymnastic   plato is aware that the training of the\\nbody may be inconsistent with the training of the mind   and that bodily\\nexercise may be easily overdone   excessive training of the body is apt\\nto give men a headache or to render them sleepy at a lecture on\\nphilosophy   and this they attribute not to the true cause   but to the\\nnature of the subject   two points are noticeable in plato  s treatment\\nof gymnastic  —first   that the time of training is entirely separated\\nfrom the time of literary education   he seems to have thought that two\\nthings of an opposite and different nature could not be learnt at the\\nsame time   here we can hardly agree with him   and   if we may judge by\\nexperience   the effect of spending three years between the ages of\\nfourteen and seventeen in mere bodily exercise would be far from\\nimproving to the intellect   secondly   he affirms that music and\\ngymnastic are not   as common opinion is apt to imagine   intended   the\\none for the cultivation of the mind and the other of the body   but that\\nthey are both equally designed for the improvement of the mind   the\\nbody   in his view   is the servant of the mind   the subjection of the\\nlower to the higher is for the advantage of both   and doubtless the\\nmind may exercise a very great and paramount influence over the body  \\nif exerted not at particular moments and by fits and starts   but\\ncontinuously   in making preparation for the whole of life   other greek\\nwriters saw the mischievous tendency of spartan discipline   arist   pol  \\nthuc       but only plato recognized the fundamental error on which the\\npractice was based  \\n\\nthe subject of gymnastic leads plato to the sister subject of medicine  \\nwhich he further illustrates by the parallel of law   the modern\\ndisbelief in medicine has led in this   as in some other departments of\\nknowledge   to a demand for greater simplicity   physicians are becoming\\naware that they often make diseases   greater and more complicated   by\\ntheir treatment of them   rep       in two thousand years their art has\\nmade but slender progress   what they have gained in the analysis of the\\nparts is in a great degree lost by their feebler conception of the\\nhuman frame as a whole   they have attended more to the cure of diseases\\nthan to the conditions of health   and the improvements in medicine have\\nbeen more than counterbalanced by the disuse of regular training   until\\nlately they have hardly thought of air and water   the importance of\\nwhich was well understood by the ancients   as aristotle remarks     air\\nand water   being the elements which we most use   have the greatest\\neffect upon health     polit       for ages physicians have been under the\\ndominion of prejudices which have only recently given way   and now\\nthere are as many opinions in medicine as in theology   and an equal\\ndegree of scepticism and some want of toleration about both   plato has\\nseveral good notions about medicine   according to him     the eye cannot\\nbe cured without the rest of the body   nor the body without the mind  \\n  charm       no man of sense   he says in the timaeus   would take physic  \\nand we heartily sympathize with him in the laws when he declares that\\n  the limbs of the rustic worn with toil will derive more benefit from\\nwarm baths than from the prescriptions of a not over wise doctor     but\\nwe can hardly praise him when   in obedience to the authority of homer  \\nhe depreciates diet   or approve of the inhuman spirit in which he would\\nget rid of invalid and useless lives by leaving them to die   he does\\nnot seem to have considered that the   bridle of theages   might be\\naccompanied by qualities which were of far more value to the state than\\nthe health or strength of the citizens   or that the duty of taking care\\nof the helpless might be an important element of education in a state  \\nthe physician himself   this is a delicate and subtle observation  \\nshould not be a man in robust health   he should have   in modern\\nphraseology   a nervous temperament   he should have experience of\\ndisease in his own person   in order that his powers of observation may\\nbe quickened in the case of others  \\n\\nthe perplexity of medicine is paralleled by the perplexity of law   in\\nwhich   again   plato would have men follow the golden rule of\\nsimplicity   greater matters are to be determined by the legislator or\\nby the oracle of delphi   lesser matters are to be left to the temporary\\nregulation of the citizens themselves   plato is aware that laissez\\nfaire is an important element of government   the diseases of a state\\nare like the heads of a hydra   they multiply when they are cut off   the\\ntrue remedy for them is not extirpation but prevention   and the way to\\nprevent them is to take care of education   and education will take care\\nof all the rest   so in modern times men have often felt that the only\\npolitical measure worth having—the only one which would produce any\\ncertain or lasting effect   was a measure of national education   and in\\nour own more than in any previous age the necessity has been recognized\\nof restoring the ever  increasing confusion of law to simplicity and\\ncommon sense  \\n\\nwhen the training in music and gymnastic is completed   there follows\\nthe first stage of active and public life   but soon education is to\\nbegin again from a new point of view   in the interval between the\\nfourth and seventh books we have discussed the nature of knowledge   and\\nhave thence been led to form a higher conception of what was required\\nof us   for true knowledge   according to plato   is of abstractions   and\\nhas to do   not with particulars or individuals   but with universals\\nonly   not with the beauties of poetry   but with the ideas of\\nphilosophy   and the great aim of education is the cultivation of the\\nhabit of abstraction   this is to be acquired through the study of the\\nmathematical sciences   they alone are capable of giving ideas of\\nrelation   and of arousing the dormant energies of thought  \\n\\nmathematics in the age of plato comprehended a very small part of that\\nwhich is now included in them   but they bore a much larger proportion\\nto the sum of human knowledge   they were the only organon of thought\\nwhich the human mind at that time possessed   and the only measure by\\nwhich the chaos of particulars could be reduced to rule and order   the\\nfaculty which they trained was naturally at war with the poetical or\\nimaginative   and hence to plato   who is everywhere seeking for\\nabstractions and trying to get rid of the illusions of sense   nearly\\nthe whole of education is contained in them   they seemed to have an\\ninexhaustible application   partly because their true limits were not\\nyet understood   these plato himself is beginning to investigate   though\\nnot aware that number and figure are mere abstractions of sense   he\\nrecognizes that the forms used by geometry are borrowed from the\\nsensible world   he seeks to find the ultimate ground of mathematical\\nideas in the idea of good   though he does not satisfactorily explain\\nthe connexion between them   and in his conception of the relation of\\nideas to numbers   he falls very far short of the definiteness\\nattributed to him by aristotle   met       but if he fails to recognize the\\ntrue limits of mathematics   he also reaches a point beyond them   in his\\nview   ideas of number become secondary to a higher conception of\\nknowledge   the dialectician is as much above the mathematician as the\\nmathematician is above the ordinary man   the one   the self  proving   the\\ngood which is the higher sphere of dialectic   is the perfect truth to\\nwhich all things ascend   and in which they finally repose  \\n\\nthis self  proving unity or idea of good is a mere vision of which no\\ndistinct explanation can be given   relative only to a particular stage\\nin greek philosophy   it is an abstraction under which no individuals\\nare comprehended   a whole which has no parts   arist     nic   eth       the\\nvacancy of such a form was perceived by aristotle   but not by plato  \\nnor did he recognize that in the dialectical process are included two\\nor more methods of investigation which are at variance with each other  \\nhe did not see that whether he took the longer or the shorter road   no\\nadvance could be made in this way   and yet such visions often have an\\nimmense effect   for although the method of science cannot anticipate\\nscience   the idea of science   not as it is   but as it will be in the\\nfuture   is a great and inspiring principle   in the pursuit of knowledge\\nwe are always pressing forward to something beyond us   and as a false\\nconception of knowledge   for example the scholastic philosophy   may\\nlead men astray during many ages   so the true ideal   though vacant   may\\ndraw all their thoughts in a right direction   it makes a great\\ndifference whether the general expectation of knowledge   as this\\nindefinite feeling may be termed   is based upon a sound judgment   for\\nmankind may often entertain a true conception of what knowledge ought\\nto be when they have but a slender experience of facts   the correlation\\nof the sciences   the consciousness of the unity of nature   the idea of\\nclassification   the sense of proportion   the unwillingness to stop\\nshort of certainty or to confound probability with truth   are important\\nprinciples of the higher education   although plato could tell us\\nnothing   and perhaps knew that he could tell us nothing   of the\\nabsolute truth   he has exercised an influence on the human mind which\\neven at the present day is not exhausted   and political and social\\nquestions may yet arise in which the thoughts of plato may be read anew\\nand receive a fresh meaning  \\n\\nthe idea of good is so called only in the republic   but there are\\ntraces of it in other dialogues of plato   it is a cause as well as an\\nidea   and from this point of view may be compared with the creator of\\nthe timaeus   who out of his goodness created all things   it corresponds\\nto a certain extent with the modern conception of a law of nature   or\\nof a final cause   or of both in one   and in this regard may be\\nconnected with the measure and symmetry of the philebus   it is\\nrepresented in the symposium under the aspect of beauty   and is\\nsupposed to be attained there by stages of initiation   as here by\\nregular gradations of knowledge   viewed subjectively   it is the process\\nor science of dialectic   this is the science which   according to the\\nphaedrus   is the true basis of rhetoric   which alone is able to\\ndistinguish the natures and classes of men and things   which divides a\\nwhole into the natural parts   and reunites the scattered parts into a\\nnatural or organized whole   which defines the abstract essences or\\nuniversal ideas of all things   and connects them   which pierces the\\nveil of hypotheses and reaches the final cause or first principle of\\nall   which regards the sciences in relation to the idea of good   this\\nideal science is the highest process of thought   and may be described\\nas the soul conversing with herself or holding communion with eternal\\ntruth and beauty   and in another form is the everlasting question and\\nanswer—the ceaseless interrogative of socrates   the dialogues of plato\\nare themselves examples of the nature and method of dialectic   viewed\\nobjectively   the idea of good is a power or cause which makes the world\\nwithout us correspond with the world within   yet this world without us\\nis still a world of ideas   with plato the investigation of nature is\\nanother department of knowledge   and in this he seeks to attain only\\nprobable conclusions   timaeus    \\n\\nif we ask whether this science of dialectic which plato only half\\nexplains to us is more akin to logic or to metaphysics   the answer is\\nthat in his mind the two sciences are not as yet distinguished   any\\nmore than the subjective and objective aspects of the world and of man  \\nwhich german philosophy has revealed to us   nor has he determined\\nwhether his science of dialectic is at rest or in motion   concerned\\nwith the contemplation of absolute being   or with a process of\\ndevelopment and evolution   modern metaphysics may be described as the\\nscience of abstractions   or as the science of the evolution of thought  \\nmodern logic   when passing beyond the bounds of mere aristotelian\\nforms   may be defined as the science of method   the germ of both of\\nthem is contained in the platonic dialectic   all metaphysicians have\\nsomething in common with the ideas of plato   all logicians have derived\\nsomething from the method of plato   the nearest approach in modern\\nphilosophy to the universal science of plato   is to be found in the\\nhegelian   succession of moments in the unity of the idea     plato and\\nhegel alike seem to have conceived the world

from the\\ncrowd   but from each other   homer was the taller and comelier person of\\nthe two   walked very erect for one of his age   and his eyes were the\\nmost quick and piercing i ever beheld

criticisms may be made on plato  s theory of education   while in\\nsome respects he unavoidably falls short of modern thinkers   in others\\nhe is in advance of them   he is opposed to the modes of

connect\\nthem   no wonder that in the vacancy of actual knowledge his followers  \\nand at times even he himself   should have fallen away from the doctrine\\nof ideas   and have returned to that

pilgrims from\\ntheir experience of evil  \\n\\non the other hand   plato is far in advance of modern philosophers and\\ntheologians when he teaches that education is to be continued through\\nlife

\\n\\n4   we remark with surprise that the progress of nations or the natural\\ngrowth of institutions which fill modern treatises on political\\nphilosophy seem hardly ever to have attracted the attention of plato\\nand aristotle   the ancients were familiar with the mutability of human\\naffairs   they could moralize over the ruins of cities and the fall of\\nempires   plato   statesman   and sulpicius   letter to cicero     by them\\nfate and chance were deemed to be real powers   almost persons   and to\\nhave had a great share in political events   the wiser of them like\\nthucydides believed that   what had been would be again     and that a\\ntolerable idea of the future could be gathered from the past   also they\\nhad dreams of a golden age which existed once upon a time and might\\nstill exist in some unknown land   or might return again in the remote\\nfuture   but the regular growth of a state enlightened by experience  \\nprogressing in knowledge   improving in the arts   of which the citizens\\nwere educated by the fulfilment of political duties   appears never to\\nhave come within the range of their hopes and aspirations   such a state\\nhad never been seen   and therefore could not be conceived by them  \\ntheir experience   aristot   metaph     plato   laws   led them to conclude\\nthat there had been cycles of civilization in which the arts had been\\ndiscovered and lost many times over   and cities had been overthrown and\\nrebuilt again and again   and deluges and volcanoes and other natural\\nconvulsions had altered the face of the earth   tradition told them of\\nmany destructions of mankind and of the preservation of a remnant   the\\nworld began again after a deluge and was reconstructed out of the\\nfragments of itself   also they were acquainted with empires of unknown\\nantiquity   like the egyptian or assyrian   but they had never seen them\\ngrow   and could not imagine   any more than we can   the state of man\\nwhich preceded them   they were puzzled and awestricken by the egyptian\\nmonuments   of which the forms   as plato says   not in a figure   but\\nliterally   were ten thousand years old   laws     and they contrasted the\\nantiquity of egypt with their own short memories  \\n\\nthe early legends of hellas have no real connection with the later\\nhistory   they are at a distance   and the intermediate region is\\nconcealed from view   there is no road or path which leads from one to\\nthe other   at the beginning of greek history   in the vestibule of the\\ntemple   is seen standing first of all the figure of the legislator  \\nhimself the interpreter and servant of the god   the fundamental laws\\nwhich he gives are not supposed to change with time and circumstances  \\nthe salvation of the state is held rather to depend on the inviolable\\nmaintenance of them   they were sanctioned by the authority of heaven  \\nand it was deemed impiety to alter them   the desire to maintain them\\nunaltered seems to be the origin of what at first sight is very\\nsurprising to us—the intolerant zeal of plato against innovators in\\nreligion or politics   laws     although with a happy inconsistency he is\\nalso willing that the laws of other countries should be studied and\\nimprovements in legislation privately communicated to the nocturnal\\ncouncil   laws     the additions which were made to them in later ages in\\norder to meet the increasing complexity of affairs were still ascribed\\nby a fiction to the original legislator   and the words of such\\nenactments at athens were disputed over as if they had been the words\\nof solon himself   plato hopes to preserve in a later generation the\\nmind of the legislator   he would have his citizens remain within the\\nlines which he has laid down for them   he would not harass them with\\nminute regulations   he would have allowed some changes in the laws   but\\nnot changes which would affect the fundamental institutions of the\\nstate   such for example as would convert an aristocracy into a\\ntimocracy   or a timocracy into a popular form of government  \\n\\npassing from speculations to facts   we observe that progress has been\\nthe exception rather than the law of human history   and therefore we\\nare not surprised to find that the idea of progress is of modern rather\\nthan of ancient date   and   like the idea of a philosophy of history   is\\nnot more than a century or two old   it seems to have arisen out of the\\nimpression left on the human mind by the growth of the roman empire and\\nof the christian church   and to be due to the political and social\\nimprovements which they introduced into the world   and still more in\\nour own century to the idealism of the first french revolution and the\\ntriumph of american independence   and in a yet greater degree to the\\nvast material prosperity and growth of population in england and her\\ncolonies and in america   it is also to be ascribed in a measure to the\\ngreater study of the philosophy of history   the optimist temperament of\\nsome great writers has assisted the creation of it   while the opposite\\ncharacter has led a few to regard the future of the world as dark   the\\n  spectator of all time and of all existence   sees more of   the\\nincreasing purpose which through the ages ran   than formerly   but to\\nthe inhabitant of a small state of hellas the vision was necessarily\\nlimited like the valley in which he dwelt   there was no remote past on\\nwhich his eye could rest   nor any future from which the veil was partly\\nlifted up by the analogy of history   the narrowness of view   which to\\nourselves appears so singular   was to him natural   if not unavoidable  \\n\\n5   for the relation of the republic to the statesman and the laws   and\\nthe two other works of plato which directly treat of politics   see the\\nintroductions to the two latter   a few general points of comparison may\\nbe touched upon in this place  \\n\\nand first of the laws  \\n\\n  1   the republic   though probably written at intervals   yet speaking\\ngenerally and judging by the indications of thought and style   may be\\nreasonably ascribed to the middle period of plato  s life   the laws are\\ncertainly the work of his declining years   and some portions of them at\\nany rate seem to have been written in extreme old age  \\n\\n  2   the republic is full of hope and aspiration   the laws bear the\\nstamp of failure and disappointment   the one is a finished work which\\nreceived the last touches of the author   the other is imperfectly\\nexecuted   and apparently unfinished   the one has the grace and beauty\\nof youth   the other has lost the poetical form   but has more of the\\nseverity and knowledge of life which is characteristic of old age  \\n\\n  3   the most conspicuous defect of the laws is the failure of dramatic\\npower   whereas the republic is full of striking contrasts of ideas and\\noppositions of character  \\n\\n  4   the laws may be said to have more the nature of a sermon   the\\nrepublic of a poem   the one is more religious   the other more\\nintellectual  \\n\\n  5   many theories of plato   such as the doctrine of ideas   the\\ngovernment of the world by philosophers   are not found in the laws   the\\nimmortality of the soul is first mentioned in xii   the person of\\nsocrates has altogether disappeared   the community of women and\\nchildren is renounced   the institution of common or public meals for\\nwomen   laws   is for the first time introduced   ar   pol      \\n\\n  6   there remains in the laws the old enmity to the poets   who are\\nironically saluted in high  flown terms   and   at the same time   are\\nperemptorily ordered out of the city   if they are not willing to submit\\ntheir poems to the censorship of the magistrates   rep      \\n\\n  7   though the work is in most respects inferior   there are a few\\npassages in the laws   such as the honour due to the soul   the evils of\\nlicentious or unnatural love   the whole of book x     religion     the\\ndishonesty of retail trade   and bequests   which come more home to us  \\nand contain more of what may be termed the modern element in plato than\\nalmost anything in the republic  \\n\\nthe relation of the two works to one another is very well given  \\n\\n  1   by aristotle in the politics from the side of the laws  —\\n\\n  the same   or nearly the same   objections apply to plato  s later work  \\nthe laws   and therefore we had better examine briefly the constitution\\nwhich is therein described   in the republic   socrates has definitely\\nsettled in all a few questions only   such as the community of women and\\nchildren   the community of property   and the constitution of the state  \\nthe population is divided into two classes—one of husbandmen   and the\\nother of warriors   from this latter is taken a third class of\\ncounsellors and rulers of the state   but socrates has not determined\\nwhether the husbandmen and artists are to have a share in the\\ngovernment   and whether they too are to carry arms and share in\\nmilitary service or not   he certainly thinks that the women ought to\\nshare in the education of the guardians   and to fight by their side  \\nthe remainder of the work is filled up with digressions foreign to the\\nmain subject   and with discussions about the education of the\\nguardians   in the laws there is hardly anything but laws   not much is\\nsaid about the constitution   this   which he had intended to make more\\nof the ordinary type   he gradually brings round to the other or ideal\\nform   for with the exception of the community of women and property   he\\nsupposes everything to be the same in both states   there is to be the\\nsame education   the citizens of both are to live free from servile\\noccupations   and there are to be common meals in both   the only\\ndifference is that in the laws the common meals are extended to women  \\nand the warriors number about 5000   but in the republic only 1000    \\n\\n  2   by plato in the laws   book v       from the side of the republic  —\\n\\n  the first and highest form of the state and of the government and of\\nthe law is that in which there prevails most widely the ancient saying\\nthat   friends have all things in common     whether there is now   or ever\\nwill be   this communion of women and children and of property   in which\\nthe private and individual is altogether banished from life   and things\\nwhich are by nature private   such as eyes and ears and hands   have\\nbecome common   and all men express praise and blame   and feel joy and\\nsorrow   on the same occasions   and the laws unite the city to the\\nutmost  —whether all this is possible or not   i say that no man   acting\\nupon any other principle   will ever constitute a state more exalted in\\nvirtue   or truer or better than this   such a state   whether inhabited\\nby gods or sons of gods   will make them blessed who dwell therein   and\\ntherefore to this we are to look for the pattern of the state   and to\\ncling to this   and   as far as possible   to seek for one which is like\\nthis   the state which we have now in hand   when created   will be\\nnearest to immortality and unity in the next degree   and after that   by\\nthe grace of god   we will complete the third one   and we will begin by\\nspeaking of the nature and origin of the second    \\n\\nthe comparatively short work called the statesman or politicus in its\\nstyle and manner is more akin to the laws   while in its idealism it\\nrather resembles the republic   as far as we can judge by various\\nindications of language and thought   it must be later than the one and\\nof course earlier than the other   in both the republic and statesman a\\nclose connection is maintained between politics and dialectic   in the\\nstatesman   enquiries into the principles of method are interspersed\\nwith discussions about politics   the comparative advantages of the rule\\nof law and of a person are considered   and the decision given in favour\\nof a person   arist   pol       but much may be said on the other side   nor\\nis the opposition necessary   for a person may rule by law   and law may\\nbe so applied as to be the living voice of the legislator   as in the\\nrepublic   there is a myth   describing   however   not a future   but a\\nformer existence of mankind   the question is asked     whether the state\\nof innocence which is described in the myth   or a state like our own\\nwhich possesses art and science and distinguishes good from evil   is\\nthe preferable condition of man     to this question of the comparative\\nhappiness of civilized and primitive life   which was so often discussed\\nin the last century and in our own   no answer is given   the statesman  \\nthough less perfect in style than the republic and of far less range  \\nmay justly be regarded as one of the greatest of plato  s dialogues  \\n\\n6   others as well as plato have chosen an ideal republic to be the\\nvehicle of thoughts which they could not definitely express   or which\\nwent beyond their own age   the classical writing which approaches most\\nnearly to the republic of plato is the   de republica   of cicero   but\\nneither in this nor in any other of his dialogues does he rival the art\\nof plato   the manners are clumsy and inferior   the hand of the\\nrhetorician is apparent at every turn   yet noble sentiments are\\nconstantly recurring   the true note of roman patriotism—  we romans are\\na great people  —resounds through the whole work   like socrates   cicero\\nturns away from the phenomena of the heavens to civil and political\\nlife   he would rather not discuss the   two suns   of which all rome was\\ntalking   when he can converse about   the two nations in one   which had\\ndivided rome ever since the days of the gracchi   like socrates again  \\nspeaking in the person of scipio   he is afraid lest he should assume\\ntoo much the character of a teacher   rather than of an equal who is\\ndiscussing among friends the two sides of a question   he would confine\\nthe terms king or state to the rule of reason and justice   and he will\\nnot concede that title either to a democracy or to a monarchy   but\\nunder the rule of reason and justice he is willing to include the\\nnatural superior ruling over the natural inferior   which he compares to\\nthe soul ruling over the body   he prefers a mixture of forms of\\ngovernment to any single one   the two portraits of the just and the\\nunjust   which occur in the second book of the republic   are transferred\\nto the state—philus   one of the interlocutors   maintaining against his\\nwill the necessity of injustice as a principle of government   while the\\nother   laelius   supports the opposite thesis   his views of language and\\nnumber are derived from plato   like him he denounces the drama   he also\\ndeclares that if his life were to be twice as long he would have no\\ntime to read the lyric poets   the picture of democracy is translated by\\nhim word for word   though he had hardly shown himself able to   carry\\nthe jest   of plato   he converts into a stately sentence the humorous\\nfancy about the animals   who   are so imbued with the spirit of\\ndemocracy that they make the passers  by get out of their way     his\\ndescription of the tyrant is imitated from plato   but is far inferior  \\nthe second book is historical   and claims for the roman constitution\\n  which is to him the ideal   a foundation of fact such as plato probably\\nintended to have given to the republic in the critias   his most\\nremarkable imitation of plato is the adaptation of the vision of er  \\nwhich is converted by cicero into the   somnium scipionis     he has\\n  romanized   the myth of the republic   adding an argument for the\\nimmortality of the soul taken from the phaedrus   and some other touches\\nderived from the phaedo and the timaeus   though a beautiful tale and\\ncontaining splendid passages   the   somnium scipionis   is very inferior\\nto the vision of er   it is only a dream   and hardly allows the reader\\nto suppose that the writer believes in his own creation   whether his\\ndialogues were framed on the model of the lost dialogues of aristotle  \\nas he himself tells us   or of plato   to which they bear many\\nsuperficial resemblances   he is still the roman orator   he is not\\nconversing   but making speeches   and is never able to mould the\\nintractable latin to the grace and ease of the greek platonic dialogue  \\nbut if he is defective in form   much more is he inferior to the greek\\nin matter   he nowhere in his philosophical writings leaves upon our\\nminds the impression of an original thinker  \\n\\nplato  s republic has been said to be a church and not a state   and such\\nan ideal of a city in the heavens has always hovered over the christian\\nworld   and is embodied in st   augustine  s   de civitate dei     which is\\nsuggested by the decay and fall of the roman empire   much in the same\\nmanner in which we may imagine the republic of plato to have been\\ninfluenced by the decline of greek politics in the writer  s own age  \\nthe difference is that in the time of plato the degeneracy   though\\ncertain   was gradual and insensible   whereas the taking of rome by the\\ngoths stirred like an earthquake the age of st   augustine   men were\\ninclined to believe that the overthrow of the city was to be ascribed\\nto the anger felt by the old roman deities at the neglect of their\\nworship   st   augustine maintains the opposite thesis   he argues that\\nthe destruction of the roman empire is due   not to the rise of\\nchristianity   but to the vices of paganism   he wanders over roman\\nhistory   and over greek philosophy and mythology   and finds everywhere\\ncrime   impiety and falsehood   he compares the worst parts of the\\ngentile religions with the best elements of the faith of christ   he\\nshows nothing of the spirit which led others of the early christian\\nfathers to recognize in the writings of the greek philosophers the\\npower of the divine truth   he traces the parallel of the kingdom of\\ngod   that is   the history of the jews   contained in their scriptures  \\nand of the kingdoms of the world   which are found in gentile writers  \\nand pursues them both into an ideal future   it need hardly be remarked\\nthat his use both of greek and of roman historians and of the sacred\\nwritings of the jews is wholly uncritical   the heathen mythology   the\\nsybilline oracles   the myths of plato   the dreams of neo  platonists are\\nequally regarded by him as matter of fact   he must be acknowledged to\\nbe a strictly polemical or controversial writer who makes the best of\\neverything on one side and the worst of everything on the other   he has\\nno sympathy with the old roman life as plato has with greek life   nor\\nhas he any idea of the ecclesiastical kingdom which was to arise out of\\nthe ruins of the roman empire   he is not blind to the defects of the\\nchristian church   and looks forward to a time when christian and pagan\\nshall be alike brought before the judgment  seat   and the true city of\\ngod shall appear      the work of st   augustine is a curious repertory of\\nantiquarian learning and quotations   deeply penetrated with christian\\nethics   but showing little power of reasoning   and a slender knowledge\\nof the greek literature and language   he was a great genius   and a\\nnoble character   yet hardly capable of feeling or understanding\\nanything external to his own theology   of all the ancient philosophers\\nhe is most attracted by plato   though he is very slightly acquainted\\nwith his writings   he is inclined to believe that the idea of creation\\nin the timaeus is derived from the narrative in genesis   and he is\\nstrangely taken with the coincidence        of plato  s saying that   the\\nphilosopher is the lover of god     and the words of the book of exodus\\nin which god reveals himself to moses   exod     he dwells at length on\\nmiracles performed in his own day   of which the evidence is regarded by\\nhim as irresistible   he speaks in a very interesting manner of the\\nbeauty and utility of nature and of the human frame   which he conceives\\nto afford a foretaste of the heavenly state and of the resurrection of\\nthe body   the book is not really what to most persons the title of it\\nwould imply   and belongs to an age which has passed away   but it\\ncontains many fine passages and thoughts which are for all time  \\n\\nthe short treatise de monarchia of dante is by far the most remarkable\\nof mediaeval ideals   and bears the impress of the great genius in whom\\nitaly and the middle ages are so vividly reflected   it is the vision of\\nan universal empire   which is supposed to be the natural and necessary\\ngovernment of the world   having a divine authority distinct from the\\npapacy   yet coextensive with it   it is not   the ghost of the dead roman\\nempire sitting crowned upon the grave thereof     but the legitimate heir\\nand successor of it   justified by the ancient virtues of the romans and\\nthe beneficence of their rule   their right to be the governors of the\\nworld is also confirmed by the testimony of miracles   and acknowledged\\nby st   paul when he appealed to caesar   and even more emphatically by\\nchrist himself   who could not have made atonement for the sins of men\\nif he had not been condemned by a divinely authorized tribunal   the\\nnecessity for the establishment of an universal empire is proved partly\\nby a priori arguments such as the unity of god and the unity of the\\nfamily or nation   partly by perversions of scripture and history   by\\nfalse analogies of nature   by misapplied quotations from the classics  \\nand by odd scraps and commonplaces of logic   showing a familiar but by\\nno means exact knowledge of aristotle   of plato there is none     but a\\nmore convincing argument still is the miserable state of the world  \\nwhich he touchingly describes   he sees no hope of happiness or peace\\nfor mankind until all nations of the earth are comprehended in a single\\nempire   the whole treatise shows how deeply the idea of the roman\\nempire was fixed in the minds of his contemporaries   not much argument\\nwas needed to maintain the truth of a theory which to his own\\ncontemporaries seemed so natural and congenial   he speaks   or rather\\npreaches   from the point of view   not of the ecclesiastic   but of the\\nlayman   although   as a good catholic   he is willing to acknowledge that\\nin certain respects the empire must submit to the church   the beginning\\nand end of all his noble reflections and of his arguments   good and\\nbad   is the aspiration   that in this little plot of earth belonging to\\nmortal man life may pass in freedom and peace     so inextricably is his\\nvision of the future bound up with the beliefs and circumstances of his\\nown age  \\n\\nthe   utopia   of sir thomas more is a surprising monument of his genius  \\nand shows a reach of thought far beyond his contemporaries   the book\\nwas written by him at the age of about 34 or 35   and is full of the\\ngenerous sentiments of youth   he brings the light of plato to bear upon\\nthe miserable state of his own country   living not long after the wars\\nof the roses   and in the dregs of the catholic church in england   he is\\nindignant at the corruption of the clergy   at the luxury of the\\nnobility and gentry   at the sufferings of the poor   at the calamities\\ncaused by war   to the eye of more the whole world was in dissolution\\nand decay   and side by side with the misery and oppression which he has\\ndescribed in the first book of the utopia   he places in the second book\\nthe ideal state which by the help of plato he had constructed   the\\ntimes were full of stir and intellectual interest   the distant murmur\\nof the reformation was beginning to be heard   to minds like more  s  \\ngreek literature was a revelation   there had arisen an art of\\ninterpretation   and the new testament was beginning to be understood as\\nit had never been before   and has not often been since   in its natural\\nsense   the life there depicted appeared to him wholly unlike that of\\nchristian commonwealths   in which   he saw nothing but a certain\\nconspiracy of rich men procuring their own commodities under the name\\nand title of the commonwealth     he thought that christ   like plato  \\n  instituted all things common     for which reason   he tells us   the\\ncitizens of utopia were the more willing to receive his doctrines\\n    howbeit   i think this was no small help and furtherance in the\\nmatter   that they heard us say that christ instituted among his   all\\nthings common   and that the same community doth yet remain in the\\nrightest christian communities     utopia         the community of property\\nis a fixed idea with him   though he is aware of the arguments which may\\nbe urged on the other side     these things   i say     when i consider with\\nmyself   i hold well with plato   and do nothing marvel that he would\\nmake no laws for them that refused those laws   whereby all men should\\nhave and enjoy equal portions of riches and commodities   for the wise\\nmen did easily foresee this to be the one and only way to the wealth of\\na community   if equality of all things should be brought in and\\nestablished     utopia         we wonder how in the reign of henry viii  \\nthough veiled in another language and published in a foreign country  \\nsuch speculations could have been endured  \\n\\nhe is gifted with far greater dramatic invention than any one who\\nsucceeded him   with the exception of swift   in the art of feigning he\\nis a worthy disciple of plato   like him   starting from a small portion\\nof fact   he founds his tale with admirable skill on a few lines in the\\nlatin narrative of the voyages of amerigo vespucci   he is very precise\\nabout dates and facts   and has the power of making us believe that the\\nnarrator of the tale must have been an eyewitness   we are fairly\\npuzzled by his manner of mixing up real and imaginary persons   his boy\\njohn clement and peter giles   citizen of antwerp   with whom he disputes\\nabout the precise words which are supposed to have been used by the\\n  imaginary   portuguese traveller   raphael hythloday     i have the more\\ncause     says hythloday     to fear that my words shall not be believed  \\nfor that i know how difficultly and hardly i myself would have believed\\nanother man telling the same   if i had not myself seen it with mine own\\neyes     or again     if you had been with me in utopia   and had presently\\nseen their fashions and laws as i did which lived there five years and\\nmore   and would never have come thence   but only to make the new land\\nknown here     etc   more greatly regrets that he forgot to ask hythloday\\nin what part of the world utopia is situated   he   would have spent no\\nsmall sum of money rather than it should have escaped him     and he begs\\npeter giles to see hythloday or write to him and obtain an answer to\\nthe question   after this we are not surprised to hear that a professor\\nof divinity   perhaps   a late famous vicar of croydon in surrey     as the\\ntranslator thinks   is desirous of being sent thither as a missionary by\\nthe high bishop     yea   and that he may himself be made bishop of\\nutopia   nothing doubting that he must obtain this bishopric with suit  \\nand he counteth that a godly suit which proceedeth not of the desire of\\nhonour or lucre   but only of a godly zeal     the design may have failed\\nthrough the disappearance of hythloday   concerning whom we have   very\\nuncertain news   after his departure   there is no doubt   however   that\\nhe had told more and giles the exact situation of the island   but\\nunfortunately at the same moment more  s attention   as he is reminded in\\na letter from giles   was drawn off by a servant   and one of the company\\nfrom a cold caught on shipboard coughed so loud as to prevent giles\\nfrom hearing   and   the secret has perished   with him   to this day the\\nplace of utopia remains unknown  \\n\\nthe words of phaedrus     o socrates   you can easily invent egyptians or\\nanything     are recalled to our mind as we read this lifelike fiction  \\nyet the greater merit of the work is not the admirable art   but the\\noriginality of thought   more is as free as plato from the prejudices of\\nhis age   and far more tolerant   the utopians do not allow him who\\nbelieves not in the immortality of the soul to share in the\\nadministration of the state   laws       howbeit they put him to no\\npunishment   because they be persuaded that it is in no man  s power to\\nbelieve what he list     and   no man is to be blamed for reasoning in\\nsupport of his own religion     one of our company in my presence was\\nsharply punished   he   as soon as he was baptised   began   against our\\nwills   with more earnest affection than wisdom   to reason of christ  s\\nreligion   and began to wax so hot in his matter   that he did not only\\nprefer our religion before all other   but also did despise and condemn\\nall other   calling them profane   and the followers of them wicked and\\ndevilish   and the children of everlasting damnation   when he had thus\\nlong reasoned the matter   they laid hold on him   accused him   and\\ncondemned him into exile   not as a despiser of religion   but as a\\nseditious person and a raiser up of dissension among the people         in\\nthe public services   no prayers be used   but such as every man may\\nboldly pronounce without giving offence to any sect     he says\\nsignificantly     there be that give worship to a man that was once of\\nexcellent virtue or of famous glory   not only as god   but also the\\nchiefest and highest god   but the most and the wisest part   rejecting\\nall these   believe that there is a certain godly power unknown   far\\nabove the capacity and reach of man  s wit   dispersed throughout all the\\nworld   not in bigness   but in virtue and power   him they call the\\nfather of all

was\\nmore from sharing the popular beliefs of his time   yet at the end he\\nreminds us that he does not in all respects agree with the customs and\\nopinions of the utopians which he describes   and we should let him have\\nthe benefit of this saving clause   and not rudely withdraw the veil\\nbehind which he has been pleased to conceal himself  \\n\\nnor is he less in advance of popular opinion in his political and moral\\nspeculations   he would like to bring military glory into contempt   he\\nwould set all sorts of idle people to profitable occupation   including\\nin the same class   priests   women   noblemen   gentlemen   and   sturdy and\\nvaliant beggars     that the labour of all may be reduced to six hours a\\nday   his dislike of capital punishment   and plans for the reformation\\nof offenders   his detestation of priests and lawyers   compare his\\nsatirical observation     they   the utopians   have priests of exceeding\\nholiness   and therefore very few       his remark that   although every one\\nmay hear of ravenous dogs and wolves and cruel man  eaters   it is not\\neasy to find states that are well and wisely governed     are curiously\\nat variance with the notions of his age and indeed with his own life  \\nthere are many points in which he shows a modern feeling and a\\nprophetic insight like plato   he is a sanitary reformer   he maintains\\nthat civilized states have a right to the soil of waste countries   he\\nis inclined to the opinion which places happiness in virtuous\\npleasures   but herein   as he thinks   not disagreeing from those other\\nphilosophers who define virtue to be a life according to nature   he\\nextends the idea of happiness so as to include the happiness of others  \\nand he argues ingeniously     all men agree that we ought to make others\\nhappy   but if others   how much more ourselves     and still he thinks\\nthat there may be a more excellent way   but to this no man  s reason can\\nattain unless heaven should inspire him with a higher truth   his\\nceremonies before marriage   his humane proposal that war should be\\ncarried on by assassinating the leaders of the enemy   may be compared\\nto some of the paradoxes of plato   he has a charming fancy   like the\\naffinities of greeks and barbarians in the timaeus   that the utopians\\nlearnt the language of the greeks with the more readiness because they\\nwere originally of the same race with them   he is penetrated with the\\nspirit of plato   and quotes or adapts many thoughts both from the\\nrepublic and from the timaeus   he prefers public duties to private   and\\nis somewhat impatient of the importunity of relations   his citizens\\nhave no silver or gold of their own   but are ready enough to pay them\\nto their mercenaries   there is nothing of which he is more contemptuous\\nthan the love of money   gold is used for fetters of criminals   and\\ndiamonds and pearls for children  s necklaces   when the ambassadors came\\narrayed in gold and peacocks   feathers   to the eyes of all the utopians\\nexcept very few   which had been in other countries for some reasonable\\ncause   all that gorgeousness of apparel seemed shameful and\\nreproachful   in so much that they most reverently saluted the vilest\\nand most abject of them for lords—passing over the ambassadors\\nthemselves without any honour   judging them by their wearing of golden\\nchains to be bondmen   you should have seen children also   that had cast\\naway their pearls and precious stones   when they saw the like sticking\\nupon the ambassadors   caps   dig and push their mothers under the sides  \\nsaying thus to them—  look   though he were a little child still     but\\nthe mother   yea and that also in good earnest     peace   son     saith she  \\n  i think he be some of the ambassadors   fools        \\n\\nlike plato he is full of satirical reflections on governments and\\nprinces   on the state of the world and of knowledge   the hero of his\\ndiscourse   hythloday   is very unwilling to become a minister of state  \\nconsidering that he would lose his independence and his advice would\\nnever be heeded   compare an exquisite passage   of which the conclusion\\nis as follows     and verily it is naturally given      suppressed and\\nended       he ridicules the new logic of his time   the utopians could\\nnever be made to understand the doctrine of second intentions     for\\nthey have not devised one of all those rules of restrictions  \\namplifications   and suppositions   very wittily invented in the small\\nlogicals   which here our children in every place do learn   furthermore  \\nthey were never yet able to find out the second intentions   insomuch\\nthat none of them all could ever see man himself in common   as they\\ncall him   though he be   as you know   bigger than was ever any giant  \\nyea   and pointed to of us even with our finger       he is very severe on\\nthe sports of the gentry   the utopians count   hunting the lowest   the\\nvilest   and the most abject part of butchery     he quotes the words of\\nthe republic in which the philosopher is described   standing out of the\\nway under a wall until the driving storm of sleet and rain be\\noverpast     which admit of a singular application to more  s own fate  \\nalthough   writing twenty years before   about the year 1514     he can\\nhardly be supposed to have foreseen this   there is no touch of satire\\nwhich strikes deeper than his quiet remark that the greater part of the\\nprecepts of christ are more at variance with the lives of ordinary\\nchristians than the discourse of utopia     and yet the most part of them\\nis more dissident from the manners of the world now a days   than my\\ncommunication was   but preachers   sly and wily men   following your\\ncounsel   as i suppose   because they saw men evil  willing to frame their\\nmanners to christ  s rule   they have wrested and wried his doctrine  \\nand   like a rule of lead   have applied it to men  s manners   that by\\nsome means at the least way   they might agree together      \\n\\nthe   new atlantis   is only a fragment   and far inferior in merit to the\\n  utopia     the work is full of ingenuity   but wanting in creative fancy  \\nand by no means impresses the reader with a sense of credibility   in\\nsome places lord bacon is characteristically different from sir thomas\\nmore   as   for example   in the external state which he attributes to the\\ngovernor of solomon  s house   whose dress he minutely describes   while\\nto sir thomas more such trappings appear simple ridiculous   yet   after\\nthis programme of dress   bacon adds the beautiful trait     that he had a\\nlook as though he pitied men     several things are borrowed by him from\\nthe timaeus   but he has injured the unity of style by adding thoughts\\nand passages which are taken from the hebrew scriptures  \\n\\nthe   city of the sun   written by campanella   1568  1639     a dominican\\nfriar   several years after the   new atlantis   of bacon   has many\\nresemblances to the republic of plato   the citizens have wives and\\nchildren in common   their marriages are of the same temporary sort   and\\nare arranged by the magistrates from time to time   they do not  \\nhowever   adopt his system of lots   but bring together the best natures  \\nmale and female     according to philosophical rules     the infants until\\ntwo years of age are brought up by their mothers in public temples   and\\nsince individuals for the most part educate their children badly   at\\nthe beginning of their third year they are committed to the care of the\\nstate   and are taught at first   not out of books   but from paintings of\\nall kinds   which are emblazoned on the walls of the city   the city has\\nsix interior circuits of walls   and an outer wall which is the seventh  \\non this outer wall are painted the figures of legislators and\\nphilosophers   and on each of the interior walls the symbols or forms of\\nsome one of the sciences are delineated   the women are   for the most\\npart   trained   like the men   in warlike and other exercises   but they\\nhave two special occupations of their own   after a battle   they and the\\nboys soothe and relieve the wounded warriors   also they encourage them\\nwith embraces and pleasant words   some elements of the christian or\\ncatholic religion are preserved among them   the life of the apostles is\\ngreatly admired by this people because they had all things in common  \\nand the short prayer which jesus christ taught men is used in their\\nworship   it is a duty of the chief magistrates to pardon sins   and\\ntherefore the whole people make secret confession of them to the\\nmagistrates   and they to their chief   who is a sort of rector\\nmetaphysicus   and by this means he is well informed of all that is\\ngoing on in the minds of men   after confession   absolution is granted\\nto the citizens collectively   but no one is mentioned by name   there\\nalso exists among them a practice of perpetual prayer   performed by a\\nsuccession of priests   who change every hour   their religion is a\\nworship of god in trinity   that is of wisdom   love and power   but\\nwithout any distinction of persons   they behold in the sun the\\nreflection of his glory   mere graven images they reject   refusing to\\nfall under the   tyranny   of idolatry  \\n\\nmany details are given about their customs of eating and drinking  \\nabout their mode of dressing   their employments   their wars   campanella\\nlooks forward to a new mode of education   which is to be a study of\\nnature   and not of aristotle   he would not have his citizens waste\\ntheir time in the consideration of what he calls   the dead signs of\\nthings     he remarks that he who knows one science only   does not really\\nknow that one any more than the rest   and insists strongly on the\\nnecessity of a variety of knowledge   more scholars are turned out in\\nthe city of the sun in one year than by contemporary methods in ten or\\nfifteen   he evidently believes   like bacon   that henceforward natural\\nscience will play a great part in education   a hope which seems hardly\\nto have been realized   either in our own or in any former age   at any\\nrate the fulfilment of it has been long deferred  \\n\\nthere is a good deal of ingenuity and even originality in this work  \\nand a most enlightened spirit pervades it   but it has little or no\\ncharm of style   and falls very far short of the   new atlantis   of\\nbacon   and still more of the   utopia   of sir thomas more   it is full of\\ninconsistencies   and though borrowed from plato   shows but a\\nsuperficial acquaintance with his writings   it is a work such as one\\nmight expect to have been written by a philosopher and man of genius\\nwho was also a friar   and who had spent twenty  seven years of his life\\nin a prison of the inquisition   the most interesting feature of the\\nbook   common to plato and sir thomas more   is the deep feeling which is\\nshown by the writer   of the misery and ignorance prevailing among the\\nlower classes in his own time   campanella takes note of aristotle  s\\nanswer to plato  s community of property   that in a society where all\\nthings are common   no individual would have any motive to work   arist  \\npol       he replies   that his citizens being happy and contented in\\nthemselves   they are required to work only four hours a day     will have\\ngreater regard for their fellows than exists among men at present   he\\nthinks   like plato   that if he abolishes private feelings and\\ninterests   a great public feeling will take their place  \\n\\nother writings on ideal states   such as the   oceana   of harrington   in\\nwhich the lord archon   meaning cromwell   is described   not as he was  \\nbut as he ought to have been   or the   argenis   of barclay   which is an\\nhistorical allegory of his own time   are too unlike plato to be worth\\nmentioning   more interesting than either of these   and far more\\nplatonic in style and thought   is sir john eliot  s   monarchy of man    \\nin which the prisoner of the tower   no longer able   to be a politician\\nin the land of his birth     turns away from politics to view   that other\\ncity which is within him     and finds on the very threshold of the grave\\nthat the secret of human happiness is the mastery of self   the change\\nof government in the time of the english commonwealth set men thinking\\nabout first principles   and gave rise to many works of this class      the\\ngreat original genius of swift owes nothing to plato   nor is there any\\ntrace in the conversation or in the works of dr   johnson of any\\nacquaintance with his writings   he probably would have refuted plato\\nwithout reading him   in the same fashion in which he supposed himself\\nto have refuted bishop berkeley  s theory of the non  existence of\\nmatter   if we except the so  called english platonists   or rather\\nneo  platonists   who never understood their master   and the writings of\\ncoleridge   who was to some extent a kindred spirit   plato has left no\\npermanent impression on english literature  \\n\\n7   human life and conduct are affected by ideals in the same way that\\nthey are affected by the examples of eminent men   neither the one nor\\nthe other are immediately applicable to practice   but there is a virtue\\nflowing from them which tends to raise individuals above the common\\nroutine of society or trade   and to elevate states above the mere\\ninterests of commerce or the necessities of self  defence   like the\\nideals of art they are partly framed by the omission of particulars  \\nthey require to be viewed at a certain distance   and are apt to fade\\naway if we attempt to approach them   they gain an imaginary\\ndistinctness when embodied in a state or in a system of philosophy   but\\nthey still remain the visions of   a world unrealized     more striking\\nand obvious to the ordinary mind are the examples of great men   who\\nhave served their own generation and are remembered in another   even in\\nour own family circle there may have been some one   a woman   or even a\\nchild   in whose face has shone forth a goodness more than human   the\\nideal then approaches nearer to us   and we fondly cling to it   the\\nideal of the past   whether of our own past lives or of former states of\\nsociety   has a singular fascination for the minds of many   too late we\\nlearn that such ideals cannot be recalled   though the recollection of\\nthem may have a humanizing influence on other times   but the\\nabstractions of philosophy are to most persons cold and vacant   they\\ngive light without warmth   they are like the full moon in the heavens\\nwhen there are no stars appearing   men cannot live by thought alone  \\nthe world of sense is always breaking in upon them   they are for the\\nmost part confined to a corner of earth   and see but a little way\\nbeyond their own home or place of abode   they   do not lift up their\\neyes to the hills     they are not awake when the dawn appears   but in\\nplato we have reached a height from which a man may look into the\\ndistance and behold the future of the world and of philosophy   the\\nideal of the state and of the life of the philosopher   the ideal of an\\neducation continuing through life and extending equally to both sexes  \\nthe ideal of the unity and correlation of knowledge   the faith in good\\nand immortality—are the vacant forms of light on which plato is seeking\\nto fix the eye of mankind  \\n\\n8   two other ideals   which never appeared above the horizon in greek\\nphilosophy   float before the minds of men in our own day   one seen more\\nclearly than formerly   as though each year and each generation brought\\nus nearer to some great change   the other almost in the same degree\\nretiring from view behind the laws of nature   as if oppressed by them  \\nbut still remaining a silent hope of we know not what hidden in the\\nheart of man   the first ideal is the future of the human race in this\\nworld   the second the future of the individual in another   the first is\\nthe more perfect realization of our own present life   the second   the\\nabnegation of it   the one   limited by experience   the other  \\ntranscending it   both of them have been and are powerful motives of\\naction   there are a few in whom they have taken the place of all\\nearthly interests   the hope of a future for the human race at first\\nsight seems to be the more disinterested   the hope of individual\\nexistence the more egotistical   of the two motives   but when men have\\nlearned to resolve their hope of a future either for themselves or for\\nthe world into the will of god—  not my will but thine     the difference\\nbetween them falls away   and they may be allowed to make either of them\\nthe basis of their lives   according to their own individual character\\nor temperament   there is as much faith in the willingness to work for\\nan unseen future in this world as in another   neither is it\\ninconceivable that some rare nature may feel his duty to another\\ngeneration   or to another century   almost as strongly as to his own   or\\nthat living always in the presence of god   he may realize another world\\nas vividly as he does this  \\n\\nthe greatest of all ideals may   or rather must be conceived by us under\\nsimilitudes derived from human qualities   although sometimes   like the\\njewish prophets   we may dash away these figures of speech and describe\\nthe nature of god only in negatives   these again by degrees acquire a\\npositive meaning   it would be well   if when meditating on the higher\\ntruths either of philosophy or religion   we sometimes substituted one\\nform of expression for another   lest through the necessities of\\nlanguage we should become the slaves of mere words  \\n\\nthere is a third ideal   not the same   but akin to these   which has a\\nplace in the home and heart of every believer in the religion of\\nchrist   and in which men seem to find a nearer and more familiar truth  \\nthe divine man   the son of man   the saviour of mankind   who is the\\nfirst  born and head of the whole family in heaven and earth   in whom\\nthe divine and human   that which is without and that which is within\\nthe range of our earthly faculties   are indissolubly united   neither is\\nthis divine form of goodness wholly separable from the ideal of the\\nchristian church   which is said in the new testament to be   his body    \\nor at variance with those other images of good which plato sets before\\nus   we see him in a figure only   and of figures of speech we select but\\na few   and those the simplest   to be the expression of him   we behold\\nhim in a picture   but he is not there   we gather up the fragments of\\nhis discourses   but neither do they represent him as he truly was   his\\ndwelling is neither in heaven nor earth   but in the heart of man   this\\nis that image which plato saw dimly in the distance   which   when\\nexisting among men   he called   in the language of homer     the likeness\\nof god     the likeness of a nature which in all ages men have felt to be\\ngreater and better than themselves   and which in endless forms   whether\\nderived from scripture or nature   from the witness of history or from\\nthe human heart   regarded as a person or not as a person   with or\\nwithout parts or passions   existing in space or not in space   is and\\nwill always continue to be to mankind the idea of good  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n the republic  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n persons of the dialogue  \\n\\n\\nsocrates   who is the narrator  \\n\\nglaucon  \\n\\nadeimantus  \\n\\npolemarchus  \\n\\ncephalus  \\n\\nthrasymachus  \\n\\ncleitophon  \\n\\nand others who are mute auditors  \\n\\nthe scene is laid in the house of cephalus at the piraeus   and the\\nwhole dialogue is narrated by socrates the day after it actually took\\nplace to timaeus   hermocrates   critias   and a nameless person   who are\\nintroduced in the timaeus  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book i  \\n\\n\\ni went down yesterday to the piraeus with glaucon the son of ariston  \\nthat i might offer up my prayers to the goddess   bendis   the thracian\\nartemis       and also because i wanted to see in what manner they would\\ncelebrate the festival   which was a new thing   i was delighted with the\\nprocession of the inhabitants   but that of the thracians was equally  \\nif not more   beautiful   when we had finished our prayers and viewed the\\nspectacle   we turned in the direction of the city   and at that instant\\npolemarchus the son of cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a\\ndistance as we were starting on our way home   and told his servant to\\nrun and bid us wait for him   the servant took hold of me by the cloak\\nbehind   and said   polemarchus desires you to wait  \\n\\ni turned round   and asked him where his master was  \\n\\nthere he is   said the youth   coming after you   if you will only wait  \\n\\ncertainly we will   said glaucon   and in a few minutes polemarchus\\nappeared   and with him adeimantus   glaucon  s brother   niceratus the son\\nof nicias   and several others who had been at the procession  \\n\\npolemarchus said to me   i perceive   socrates   that you and your\\ncompanion are already on your way to the city  \\n\\nyou are not far wrong   i said  \\n\\nbut do you see   he rejoined   how many we are  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nand are you stronger than all these   for if not   you will have to\\nremain where you are  \\n\\nmay there not be the alternative   i said   that we may persuade you to\\nlet us go  \\n\\nbut can you persuade us   if we refuse to listen to you   he said  \\n\\ncertainly not   replied glaucon  \\n\\nthen we are not going to listen   of that you may be assured  \\n\\nadeimantus added   has no one told you of the torch  race on horseback in\\nhonour of the goddess which will take place in the evening  \\n\\nwith horses   i replied   that is a novelty   will horsemen carry torches\\nand pass them one to another during the race  \\n\\nyes   said polemarchus   and not only so   but a festival will be\\ncelebrated at night   which you certainly ought to see   let us rise soon\\nafter supper and see this festival   there will be a gathering of young\\nmen   and we will have a good talk   stay then   and do not be perverse  \\n\\nglaucon said   i suppose   since you insist   that we must  \\n\\nvery good   i replied  \\n\\naccordingly we went with polemarchus to his house   and there we found\\nhis brothers lysias and euthydemus   and with them thrasymachus the\\nchalcedonian   charmantides the paeanian   and cleitophon the son of\\naristonymus   there too was cephalus the father of polemarchus   whom i\\nhad not seen for a long time   and i thought him very much aged   he was\\nseated on a cushioned chair   and had a garland on his head   for he had\\nbeen sacrificing in the court   and there were some other chairs in the\\nroom arranged in a semicircle   upon which we sat down by him   he\\nsaluted me eagerly   and then he said  —\\n\\nyou don  t come to see me   socrates   as often as you ought   if i were\\nstill able to go and see you i would not ask you to come to me   but at\\nmy age i can hardly get to the city   and therefore you should come\\noftener to the piraeus   for let me tell you   that the more the\\npleasures of the body fade away   the greater to me is the pleasure and\\ncharm of conversation   do not then deny my request   but make our house\\nyour resort and keep company with these young men   we are old friends  \\nand you will be quite at home with us  \\n\\ni replied   there is nothing which for my part i like better   cephalus  \\nthan conversing with aged men   for i regard them as travellers who have\\ngone a journey which i too may have to go   and of whom i ought to\\nenquire   whether the way is smooth and easy   or rugged and difficult  \\nand this is a question which i should like to ask of you who have\\narrived at that time which the poets call the   threshold of old age  —is\\nlife harder towards the end   or what report do you give of it  \\n\\ni will tell you   socrates   he said   what my own feeling is   men of my\\nage flock together   we are birds of a feather   as the old proverb says  \\nand at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is—i cannot\\neat   i cannot drink   the pleasures of youth and love are fled away  \\nthere was a good time once   but now that is gone   and life is no longer\\nlife   some complain of the slights which are put upon them by\\nrelations   and they will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age\\nis the cause   but to me   socrates   these complainers seem to blame that\\nwhich is not really in fault   for if old age were the cause   i too\\nbeing old   and every other old man   would have felt as they do   but\\nthis is not my own experience   nor that of others whom i have known  \\nhow well i remember the aged poet sophocles   when in answer to the\\nquestion   how does love suit with age   sophocles  —are you still the man\\nyou were   peace   he replied   most gladly have i escaped the thing of\\nwhich you speak   i feel as if i had escaped from a mad and furious\\nmaster   his words have often occurred to my mind since   and they seem\\nas good to me now as at the time when he uttered them   for certainly\\nold age has a great sense of calm and freedom   when the passions relax\\ntheir hold   then   as sophocles says   we are freed from the grasp not of\\none mad master only   but of many   the truth is   socrates   that these\\nregrets   and also the complaints about relations   are to be attributed\\nto the same cause   which is not old age   but men  s characters and\\ntempers   for he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the\\npressure of age   but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and\\nage are equally a burden  \\n\\ni listened in admiration   and wanting to draw him out   that he might go\\non—yes   cephalus   i said   but i rather suspect that people in general\\nare not convinced by you when you speak thus   they think that old age\\nsits lightly upon you   not because of your happy disposition   but\\nbecause you are rich   and wealth is well known to be a great comforter  \\n\\nyou are right   he replied   they are not convinced   and there is\\nsomething in what they say   not   however   so much as they imagine   i\\nmight answer them as themistocles answered the seriphian who was\\nabusing him and saying that he was famous   not for his own merits but\\nbecause he was an athenian     if you had been a native of my country or\\ni of yours   neither of us would have been famous     and to those who are\\nnot rich and are impatient of old age   the same reply may be made   for\\nto the good poor man old age cannot be a light burden   nor can a bad\\nrich man ever have peace with himself  \\n\\nmay i ask   cephalus   whether your fortune was for the most part\\ninherited or acquired by you  \\n\\nacquired   socrates   do you want to know how much i acquired   in the art\\nof making money i have been midway between my father and grandfather  \\nfor my grandfather   whose name i bear   doubled and trebled the value of\\nhis patrimony   that which he inherited being much what i possess now  \\nbut my father lysanias reduced the property below what it is at\\npresent   and i shall be satisfied if i leave to these my sons not less\\nbut a little more than i received  \\n\\nthat was why i asked you the question   i replied   because i see that\\nyou are indifferent about money   which is a characteristic rather of\\nthose who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired\\nthem   the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation\\nof their own   resembling the affection of authors for their own poems  \\nor of parents for their children   besides that natural love of it for\\nthe sake of use and profit which is common to them and all men   and\\nhence they are very bad company   for they can talk about nothing but\\nthe praises of wealth  \\n\\nthat is true   he said  \\n\\nyes   that is very true   but may i ask another question  —what do you\\nconsider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your\\nwealth  \\n\\none   he said   of which i could not expect easily to convince others  \\nfor let me tell you   socrates   that when a man thinks himself to be\\nnear death   fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had\\nbefore   the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted\\nthere of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him   but now he\\nis tormented with the thought that they may be true   either from the\\nweakness of age   or because he is now drawing nearer to that other\\nplace   he has a clearer view of these things   suspicions and alarms\\ncrowd thickly upon him   and he begins to reflect and consider what\\nwrongs he has done to others   and when he finds that the sum of his\\ntransgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up in\\nhis sleep for fear   and he is filled with dark forebodings   but to him\\nwho is conscious of no sin   sweet hope   as pindar charmingly says   is\\nthe kind nurse of his age  \\n\\n  hope     he says     cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice and\\nholiness   and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his\\njourney  —hope which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man    \\n\\nhow admirable are his words   and the great blessing of riches   i do not\\nsay to every man   but to a good man   is   that he has had no occasion to\\ndeceive or to defraud others   either intentionally or unintentionally  \\nand when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension\\nabout offerings due to the gods or debts which he owes to men   now to\\nthis peace of mind the possession of wealth greatly contributes   and\\ntherefore i say   that   setting one thing against another   of the many\\nadvantages which wealth has to give   to a man of sense this is in my\\nopinion the greatest  \\n\\nwell said   cephalus   i replied   but as concerning justice   what is\\nit  —to speak the truth and to pay your debts—no more than this   and\\neven to this are there not exceptions   suppose that a friend when in\\nhis right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he\\nis not in his right mind   ought i to give them back to him   no one\\nwould say that i ought or that i should be right in doing so   any more\\nthan they would say that i ought always to speak the truth to one who\\nis in his condition  \\n\\nyou are quite right   he replied  \\n\\nbut then   i said   speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a\\ncorrect definition of justice  \\n\\nquite correct   socrates   if simonides is to be believed   said\\npolemarchus interposing  \\n\\ni fear   said cephalus   that i must go now   for i have to look after the\\nsacrifices   and i hand over the argument to polemarchus and the\\ncompany  \\n\\nis not polemarchus your heir   i said  \\n\\nto be sure   he answered   and went away laughing to the sacrifices  \\n\\ntell me then   o thou heir of the argument   what did simonides say   and\\naccording to you truly say   about justice  \\n\\nhe said that the repayment of a debt is just   and in saying so he\\nappears to me to be right  \\n\\ni should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired man  \\nbut his meaning   though probably clear to you   is the reverse of clear\\nto me   for he certainly does not mean   as we were just now saying   that\\ni ought to return a deposit of arms or of anything else to one who asks\\nfor it when he is not in his right senses   and yet a deposit cannot be\\ndenied to be a debt  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthen when the person who asks me is not in his right mind i am by no\\nmeans to make the return  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nwhen simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice   he did\\nnot mean to include that case  \\n\\ncertainly not   for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good to a\\nfriend and never evil  \\n\\nyou mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury of\\nthe receiver   if the two parties are friends   is not the repayment of a\\ndebt  —that is what you would imagine him to say  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand are enemies also to receive what we owe to them  \\n\\nto be sure   he said   they are to receive what we owe them   and an\\nenemy   as i take it   owes to an enemy that which is due or proper to\\nhim—that is to say   evil  \\n\\nsimonides   then   after the manner of poets   would seem to have spoken\\ndarkly of the nature of justice   for he really meant to say that\\njustice is the giving to each man what is proper to him   and this he\\ntermed a debt  \\n\\nthat must have been his meaning   he said  \\n\\nby heaven   i replied   and if we asked him what due or proper thing is\\ngiven by medicine   and to whom   what answer do you think that he would\\nmake to us  \\n\\nhe would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink to\\nhuman bodies  \\n\\nand what due or proper thing is given by cookery   and to what  \\n\\nseasoning to food  \\n\\nand what is that which justice gives   and to whom  \\n\\nif   socrates   we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the\\npreceding instances   then justice is the art which gives good to\\nfriends and evil to enemies  \\n\\nthat is his meaning then  \\n\\ni think so  \\n\\nand who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies\\nin time of sickness  \\n\\nthe physician  \\n\\nor when they are on a voyage   amid the perils of the sea  \\n\\nthe pilot  \\n\\nand in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just\\nman most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friend  \\n\\nin going to war against the one and in making alliances with the other  \\n\\nbut when a man is well   my dear polemarchus   there is no need of a\\nphysician  \\n\\nno  \\n\\nand he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot  \\n\\nno  \\n\\nthen in time of peace justice will be of no use  \\n\\ni am very far from thinking so  \\n\\nyou think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nlike husbandry for the acquisition of corn  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nor like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes  —that is what you mean  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of\\npeace  \\n\\nin contracts   socrates   justice is of use  \\n\\nand by contracts you mean partnerships  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nbut is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better\\npartner at a game of draughts  \\n\\nthe skilful player  \\n\\nand in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful or\\nbetter partner than the builder  \\n\\nquite the reverse  \\n\\nthen in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than\\nthe harp  player   as in playing the harp the harp  player is certainly a\\nbetter partner than the just man  \\n\\nin a money partnership  \\n\\nyes   polemarchus   but surely not in the use of money   for you do not\\nwant a just man to be your counsellor in the purchase or sale of a\\nhorse   a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that  \\nwould he not  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand when you want to buy a ship   the shipwright or the pilot would be\\nbetter  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthen what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man is\\nto be preferred  \\n\\nwhen you want a deposit to be kept safely  \\n\\nyou mean when money is not wanted   but allowed to lie  \\n\\nprecisely  \\n\\nthat is to say   justice is useful when money is useless  \\n\\nthat is the inference  \\n\\nand when you want to keep a pruning  hook safe   then justice is useful\\nto the individual and to the state   but when you want to use it   then\\nthe art of the vine  dresser  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nand when you want to keep a shield or a lyre   and not to use them   you\\nwould say that justice is useful   but when you want to use them   then\\nthe art of the soldier or of the musician  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand so of all other things  —justice is useful when they are useless  \\nand useless when they are useful  \\n\\nthat is the inference  \\n\\nthen justice is not good for much   but let us consider this further\\npoint   is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in any\\nkind of fighting best able to ward off a blow  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is\\nbest able to create one  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a march\\nupon the enemy  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nthen he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief  \\n\\nthat   i suppose   is to be inferred  \\n\\nthen if the just man is good at keeping money   he is good at stealing\\nit  \\n\\nthat is implied in the argument  \\n\\nthen after all the just man has turned out to be a thief   and this is a\\nlesson which i suspect you must have learnt out of homer   for he  \\nspeaking of autolycus   the maternal grandfather of odysseus   who is a\\nfavourite of his   affirms that\\n\\n  he was excellent above all men in theft and perjury    \\n\\nand so   you and homer and simonides are agreed that justice is an art\\nof theft   to be practised however   for the good of friends and for the\\nharm of enemies    —that was what you were saying  \\n\\nno   certainly not that   though i do not now know what i did say   but i\\nstill stand by the latter words  \\n\\nwell   there is another question   by friends and enemies do we mean\\nthose who are so really   or only in seeming  \\n\\nsurely   he said   a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks\\ngood   and to hate those whom he thinks evil  \\n\\nyes   but do not persons often err about good and evil   many who are not\\ngood seem to be so   and conversely  \\n\\nthat is true  \\n\\nthen to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their\\nfriends   true  \\n\\nand in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil\\nto the good  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nbut the good are just and would not do an injustice  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthen according to your argument it is just to injure those who do no\\nwrong  \\n\\nnay   socrates   the doctrine is immoral  \\n\\nthen i suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the\\nunjust  \\n\\ni like that better  \\n\\nbut see the consequence  —many a man who is ignorant of human nature has\\nfriends who are bad friends   and in that case he ought to do harm to\\nthem   and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit   but   if so   we\\nshall be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be the\\nmeaning of simonides  \\n\\nvery true   he said   and i think that we had better correct an error\\ninto which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words   friend   and\\n  enemy    \\n\\nwhat was the error   polemarchus   i asked  \\n\\nwe assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought good  \\n\\nand how is the error to be corrected  \\n\\nwe should rather say that he is a friend who is   as well as seems  \\ngood   and that he who seems only   and is not good   only seems to be and\\nis not a friend   and of an enemy the same may be said  \\n\\nyou would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand instead of saying simply as we did at first   that it is just to do\\ngood to our friends and harm to our enemies   we should further say   it\\nis just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our\\nenemies when they are evil  \\n\\nyes   that appears to me to be the truth  \\n\\nbut ought the just to injure any one at all  \\n\\nundoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his\\nenemies  \\n\\nwhen horses are injured   are they improved or deteriorated  \\n\\nthe latter  \\n\\ndeteriorated   that is to say   in the good qualities of horses   not of\\ndogs  \\n\\nyes   of horses  \\n\\nand dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs   and not of\\nhorses  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nand will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is the\\nproper virtue of man  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand that human virtue is justice  \\n\\nto be sure  \\n\\nthen men who are injured are of necessity made unjust  \\n\\nthat is the result  \\n\\nbut can the musician by his art make men unmusical  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nor the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nand can the just by justice make men unjust   or speaking generally   can\\nthe good by virtue make them bad  \\n\\nassuredly not  \\n\\nany more than heat can produce cold  \\n\\nit cannot  \\n\\nor drought moisture  \\n\\nclearly not  \\n\\nnor can the good harm any one  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nand the just is the good  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nthen to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man  \\nbut of the opposite   who is the unjust  \\n\\ni think that what you say is quite true   socrates  \\n\\nthen if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts   and\\nthat good is the debt which a just man owes to his friends   and evil\\nthe debt which he owes to his enemies  —to say this is not wise   for it\\nis not true   if   as has been clearly shown   the injuring of another can\\nbe in no case just  \\n\\ni agree with you   said polemarchus  \\n\\nthen you and i are prepared to take up arms against any one who\\nattributes such a saying to simonides or bias or pittacus   or any other\\nwise man or seer  \\n\\ni am quite ready to do battle at your side   he said  \\n\\nshall i tell you whose i believe the saying to be  \\n\\nwhose  \\n\\ni believe that periander or perdiccas or xerxes or ismenias the theban  \\nor some other rich and mighty man   who had a great opinion of his own\\npower   was the first to say that justice is   doing good to your friends\\nand harm to your enemies    \\n\\nmost true   he said  \\n\\nyes   i said   but if this definition of justice also breaks down   what\\nother can be offered  \\n\\nseveral times in the course of the discussion thrasymachus had made an\\nattempt to get the argument into his own hands   and had been put down\\nby the rest of the company   who wanted to hear the end   but when\\npolemarchus and i had done speaking and there was a pause   he could no\\nlonger hold his peace   and   gathering himself up   he came at us like a\\nwild beast   seeking to devour us   we were quite panic  stricken at the\\nsight of him  \\n\\nhe roared out to the whole company   what folly   socrates   has taken\\npossession of you all   and why   sillybillies   do you knock under to one\\nanother   i say that if you want really to know what justice is   you\\nshould not only ask but answer   and you should not seek honour to\\nyourself from the refutation of an opponent   but have your own answer  \\nfor there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer   and now i will\\nnot have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit or gain or\\ninterest   for this sort of nonsense will not do for me   i must have\\nclearness and accuracy  \\n\\ni was panic  stricken at his words   and could not look at him without\\ntrembling   indeed i believe that if i had not fixed my eye upon him   i\\nshould have been struck dumb   but when i saw his fury rising   i looked\\nat him first   and was therefore able to reply to him  \\n\\nthrasymachus   i said   with a quiver   don  t be hard upon us   polemarchus\\nand i may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument   but i\\ncan assure you that the error was not intentional   if we were seeking\\nfor a piece of gold   you would not imagine that we were   knocking under\\nto one another     and so losing our chance of finding it   and why   when\\nwe are seeking for justice   a thing more precious than many pieces of\\ngold   do you say that we are weakly yielding to one another and not\\ndoing our utmost to get at the truth   nay   my good friend   we are most\\nwilling and anxious to do so   but the fact is that we cannot   and if\\nso   you people who know all things should pity us and not be angry with\\nus  \\n\\nhow characteristic of socrates   he replied   with a bitter laugh  —that  s\\nyour ironical style   did i not foresee—have i not already told you  \\nthat whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer   and try irony or\\nany other shuffle   in order that he might avoid answering  \\n\\nyou are a philosopher   thrasymachus   i replied   and well know that if\\nyou ask a person what numbers make up twelve   taking care to prohibit\\nhim whom you ask from answering twice six   or three times four   or six\\ntimes two   or four times three     for this sort of nonsense will not do\\nfor me    —then obviously   if that is your way of putting the question  \\nno one can answer you   but suppose that he were to retort  \\n  thrasymachus   what do you mean   if one of these numbers which you\\ninterdict be the true answer to the question   am i falsely to say some\\nother number which is not the right one  —is that your meaning    —how\\nwould you answer him  \\n\\njust as if the two cases were at all alike   he said  \\n\\nwhy should they not be   i replied   and even if they are not   but only\\nappear to be so to the person who is asked   ought he not to say what he\\nthinks   whether you and i forbid him or not  \\n\\ni presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted\\nanswers  \\n\\ni dare say that i may   notwithstanding the danger   if upon reflection i\\napprove of any of them  \\n\\nbut what if i give you an answer about justice other and better   he\\nsaid   than any of these   what do you deserve to have done to you  \\n\\ndone to me  —as becomes the ignorant   i must learn from the wise—that is\\nwhat i deserve to have done to me  \\n\\nwhat   and no payment   a pleasant notion  \\n\\ni will pay when i have the money   i replied  \\n\\nbut you have   socrates   said glaucon   and you   thrasymachus   need be\\nunder no anxiety about money   for we will all make a contribution for\\nsocrates  \\n\\nyes   he replied   and then socrates will do as he always does—refuse to\\nanswer himself   but take and pull to pieces the answer of some one\\nelse  \\n\\nwhy   my good friend   i said   how can any one answer who knows   and says\\nthat he knows   just nothing   and who   even if he has some faint notions\\nof his own   is told by a man of authority not to utter them   the\\nnatural thing is   that the speaker should be some one like yourself who\\nprofesses to know and can tell what he knows   will you then kindly\\nanswer   for the edification of the company and of myself  \\n\\nglaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request   and\\nthrasymachus   as any one might see   was in reality eager to speak   for\\nhe thought that he had an excellent answer   and would distinguish\\nhimself   but at first he affected to insist on my answering   at length\\nhe consented to begin   behold   he said   the wisdom of socrates   he\\nrefuses to teach himself   and goes about learning of others   to whom he\\nnever even says thank you  \\n\\nthat i learn of others   i replied   is quite true   but that i am\\nungrateful i wholly deny   money i have none   and therefore i pay in\\npraise   which is all i have   and how ready i am to praise any one who\\nappears to me to speak well you will very soon find out when you\\nanswer   for i expect that you will answer well  \\n\\nlisten   then   he said   i proclaim that justice is nothing else than the\\ninterest of the stronger   and now why do you not praise me   but of\\ncourse you won  t  \\n\\nlet me first understand you   i replied   justice   as you say   is the\\ninterest of the stronger   what   thrasymachus   is the meaning of this  \\nyou cannot mean to say that because polydamas   the pancratiast   is\\nstronger than we are   and finds the eating of beef conducive to his\\nbodily strength   that to eat beef is therefore equally for our good who\\nare weaker than he is   and right and just for us  \\n\\nthat  s abominable of you   socrates   you take the words in the sense\\nwhich is most damaging to the argument  \\n\\nnot at all   my good sir   i said   i am trying to understand them   and i\\nwish that you would be a little clearer  \\n\\nwell   he said   have you never heard that forms of government differ  \\nthere are tyrannies   and there are democracies   and there are\\naristocracies  \\n\\nyes   i know  \\n\\nand the government is the ruling power in each state  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand the different forms of government make laws democratical  \\naristocratical   tyrannical   with a view to their several interests   and\\nthese laws   which are made by them for their own interests   are the\\njustice which they deliver to their subjects   and him who transgresses\\nthem they punish as a breaker of the law   and unjust   and that is what\\ni mean when i say that in all states there is the same principle of\\njustice   which is the interest of the government   and as the government\\nmust be supposed to have power   the only reasonable conclusion is   that\\neverywhere there is one principle of justice   which is the interest of\\nthe stronger  \\n\\nnow i understand you   i said   and whether you are right or not i will\\ntry to discover   but let me remark   that in defining justice you have\\nyourself used the word   interest   which you forbade me to use   it is\\ntrue   however   that in your definition the words   of the stronger   are\\nadded  \\n\\na small addition   you must allow   he said  \\n\\ngreat or small   never mind about that   we must first enquire whether\\nwhat you are saying is the truth   now we are both agreed that justice\\nis interest of some sort   but you go on to say   of the stronger     about\\nthis addition i am not so sure   and must therefore consider further  \\n\\nproceed  \\n\\ni will   and first tell me   do you admit that it is just for subjects to\\nobey their rulers  \\n\\ni do  \\n\\nbut are the rulers of states absolutely infallible   or are they\\nsometimes liable to err  \\n\\nto be sure   he replied   they are liable to err  \\n\\nthen in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly   and\\nsometimes not  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nwhen they make them rightly   they make them agreeably to their\\ninterest   when they are mistaken   contrary to their interest   you admit\\nthat  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects  —and that\\nis what you call justice  \\n\\ndoubtless  \\n\\nthen justice   according to your argument   is not only obedience to the\\ninterest of the stronger but the reverse  \\n\\nwhat is that you are saying   he asked  \\n\\ni am only repeating what you are saying   i believe   but let us\\nconsider   have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about\\ntheir own interest in what they command   and also that to obey them is\\njustice   has not that been admitted  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthen you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest\\nof the stronger   when the rulers unintentionally command things to be\\ndone which are to their own injury   for if   as you say   justice is the\\nobedience which the subject renders to their commands   in that case   o\\nwisest of men   is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker\\nare commanded to do   not what is for the interest   but what is for the\\ninjury of the stronger  \\n\\nnothing can be clearer   socrates   said polemarchus  \\n\\nyes   said cleitophon   interposing   if you are allowed to be his\\nwitness  \\n\\nbut there is no need of any witness   said polemarchus   for thrasymachus\\nhimself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for\\ntheir own interest   and that for subjects to obey them is justice  \\n\\nyes   polemarchus  —thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what was\\ncommanded by their rulers is just  \\n\\nyes   cleitophon   but he also said that justice is the interest of the\\nstronger   and   while admitting both these propositions   he further\\nacknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his\\nsubjects to do what is not for his own interest   whence follows that\\njustice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger  \\n\\nbut   said cleitophon   he meant by the interest of the stronger what the\\nstronger thought to be his interest  —this was what the weaker had to\\ndo   and this was affirmed by him to be justice  \\n\\nthose were not his words   rejoined polemarchus  \\n\\nnever mind   i replied   if he now says that they are   let us accept his\\nstatement   tell me   thrasymachus   i said   did you mean by justice what\\nthe stronger thought to be his interest   whether really so or not  \\n\\ncertainly not   he said   do you suppose that i call him who is mistaken\\nthe stronger at the time when he is mistaken  \\n\\nyes   i said   my impression was that you did so   when you admitted that\\nthe ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken  \\n\\nyou argue like an informer   socrates   do you mean   for example   that he\\nwho is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken  \\nor that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or\\ngrammarian at the time when he is making the mistake   in respect of the\\nmistake   true   we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian\\nhas made a mistake   but this is only a way of speaking   for the fact is\\nthat neither the grammarian nor any other person of skill ever makes a\\nmistake in so far as he is what his name implies   they none of them err\\nunless their skill fails them   and then they cease to be skilled\\nartists   no artist or sage or ruler errs at the time when he is what\\nhis name implies   though he is commonly said to err   and i adopted the\\ncommon mode of speaking   but to be perfectly accurate   since you are\\nsuch a lover of accuracy   we should say that the ruler   in so far as he\\nis a ruler   is unerring   and   being unerring   always commands that\\nwhich is for his own interest   and the subject is required to execute\\nhis commands   and therefore   as i said at first and now repeat   justice\\nis the interest of the stronger  \\n\\nindeed   thrasymachus   and do i really appear to you to argue like an\\ninformer  \\n\\ncertainly   he replied  \\n\\nand do you suppose that i ask these questions with any design of\\ninjuring you in the argument  \\n\\nnay   he replied     suppose   is not the word—i know it   but you will be\\nfound out   and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail  \\n\\ni shall not make the attempt   my dear man   but to avoid any\\nmisunderstanding occurring between us in future   let me ask   in what\\nsense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest   as you were\\nsaying   he being the superior   it is just that the inferior should\\nexecute—is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict sense of the\\nterm  \\n\\nin the strictest of all senses   he said   and now cheat and play the\\ninformer if you can   i ask no quarter at your hands   but you never will\\nbe able   never  \\n\\nand do you imagine   i said   that i am such a madman as to try and\\ncheat   thrasymachus   i might as well shave a lion  \\n\\nwhy   he said   you made the attempt a minute ago   and you failed  \\n\\nenough   i said   of these civilities   it will be better that i should\\nask you a question   is the physician   taken in that strict sense of\\nwhich you are speaking   a healer of the sick or a maker of money   and\\nremember that i am now speaking of the true physician  \\n\\na healer of the sick   he replied  \\n\\nand the pilot—that is to say   the true pilot—is he a captain of sailors\\nor a mere sailor  \\n\\na captain of sailors  \\n\\nthe circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into\\naccount   neither is he to be called a sailor   the name pilot by which\\nhe is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing   but is significant\\nof his skill and of his authority over the sailors  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nnow   i said   every art has an interest  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nfor which the art has to consider and provide  \\n\\nyes   that is the aim of art  \\n\\nand the interest of any art is the perfection of it—this and nothing\\nelse  \\n\\nwhat do you mean  \\n\\ni mean what i may illustrate negatively by the example of the body  \\nsuppose you were to ask me whether the body is self  sufficing or has\\nwants   i should reply   certainly the body has wants   for the body may\\nbe ill and require to be cured   and has therefore interests to which\\nthe art of medicine ministers   and this is the origin and intention of\\nmedicine   as you will acknowledge   am i not right  \\n\\nquite right   he replied  \\n\\nbut is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in any\\nquality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the\\near fail of hearing   and therefore requires another art to provide for\\nthe interests of seeing and hearing—has art in itself   i say   any\\nsimilar liability to fault or defect   and does every art require\\nanother supplementary art to provide for its interests   and that\\nanother and another without end   or have the arts to look only after\\ntheir own interests   or have they no need either of themselves or of\\nanother  —having no faults or defects   they have no need to correct\\nthem   either by the exercise of their own art or of any other   they\\nhave only to consider the interest of their subject  matter   for every\\nart remains pure and faultless while remaining true—that is to say  \\nwhile perfect and unimpaired   take the words in your precise sense   and\\ntell me whether i am not right  \\n\\nyes   clearly  \\n\\nthen medicine does not consider the interest of medicine   but the\\ninterest of the body  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nnor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art of\\nhorsemanship   but the interests of the horse   neither do any other arts\\ncare for themselves   for they have no needs   they care only for that\\nwhich is the subject of their art  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nbut surely   thrasymachus   the arts are the superiors and rulers of\\ntheir own subjects  \\n\\nto this he assented with a good deal of reluctance  \\n\\nthen   i said   no science or art considers or enjoins the interest of\\nthe stronger or superior   but only the interest of the subject and\\nweaker  \\n\\nhe made an attempt to contest this proposition also   but finally\\nacquiesced  \\n\\nthen   i continued   no physician   in so far as he is a physician  \\nconsiders his own good in what he prescribes   but the good of his\\npatient   for the true physician is also a ruler having the human body\\nas a subject   and is not a mere money  maker   that has been admitted  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand the pilot likewise   in the strict sense of the term   is a ruler of\\nsailors and not a mere sailor  \\n\\nthat has been admitted  \\n\\nand such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest\\nof the sailor who is under him   and not for his own or the ruler  s\\ninterest  \\n\\nhe gave a reluctant   yes    \\n\\nthen   i said   thrasymachus   there is no one in any rule who   in so far\\nas he is a ruler   considers or enjoins what is for his own interest  \\nbut always what is for the interest of his subject or suitable to his\\nart   to that he looks   and that alone he considers in everything which\\nhe says and does  \\n\\nwhen we had got to this point in the argument   and every one saw that\\nthe definition of justice had been completely upset   thrasymachus  \\ninstead of replying to me   said   tell me   socrates   have you got a\\nnurse  \\n\\nwhy do you ask such a question   i said   when you ought rather to be\\nanswering  \\n\\nbecause she leaves you to snivel   and never wipes your nose   she has\\nnot even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep  \\n\\nwhat makes you say that   i replied  \\n\\nbecause you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens or tends the\\nsheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of\\nhimself or his master   and you further imagine that the rulers of\\nstates   if they are true rulers   never think of their subjects as\\nsheep   and that they are not studying their own advantage day and\\nnight   oh   no   and so entirely astray are you in your ideas about the\\njust and unjust as not even to know that justice and the just are in\\nreality another  s good   that is to say   the interest of the ruler and\\nstronger   and the loss of the subject and servant   and injustice the\\nopposite   for the unjust is lord over the truly simple and just   he is\\nthe stronger   and his subjects do what is for his interest   and\\nminister to his happiness   which is very far from being their own  \\nconsider further   most foolish socrates   that the just is always a\\nloser in comparison with the unjust   first of all   in private\\ncontracts   wherever the unjust is the partner of the just you will find\\nthat   when the partnership is dissolved   the unjust man has always more\\nand the just less   secondly   in their dealings with the state   when\\nthere is an income  tax   the just man will pay more and the unjust less\\non the same amount of income   and when there is anything to be received\\nthe one gains nothing and the other much   observe also what happens\\nwhen they take an office   there is the just man neglecting his affairs\\nand perhaps suffering other losses   and getting nothing out of the\\npublic   because he is just   moreover he is hated by his friends and\\nacquaintance for refusing to serve them in unlawful ways   but all this\\nis reversed in the case of the unjust man   i am speaking   as before   of\\ninjustice on a large scale in which the advantage of the unjust is most\\napparent   and my meaning will be most clearly seen if we turn to that\\nhighest form of injustice in which the criminal is the happiest of men  \\nand the sufferers or those who refuse to do injustice are the most\\nmiserable—that is to say tyranny   which by fraud and force takes away\\nthe property of others   not little by little but wholesale  \\ncomprehending in one   things sacred as well as profane   private and\\npublic   for which acts of wrong   if he were detected perpetrating any\\none of them singly   he would be punished and incur great disgrace—they\\nwho do such wrong in particular cases are called robbers of temples  \\nand man  stealers and burglars and swindlers and thieves   but when a man\\nbesides taking away the money of the citizens has made slaves of them  \\nthen   instead of these names of reproach   he is termed happy and\\nblessed   not only by the citizens but by all who hear of his having\\nachieved the consummation of injustice   for mankind censure injustice  \\nfearing that they may be the victims of it and not because they shrink\\nfrom committing it   and thus   as i have shown   socrates   injustice  \\nwhen on a sufficient scale   has more strength and freedom and mastery\\nthan justice   and   as i said at first   justice is the interest of the\\nstronger   whereas injustice is a man  s own profit and interest  \\n\\nthrasymachus   when he had thus spoken   having   like a bath  man   deluged\\nour ears with his words   had a mind to go away   but the company would\\nnot let him   they insisted that he should remain and defend his\\nposition   and i myself added my own humble request that he would not\\nleave us   thrasymachus   i said to him   excellent man   how suggestive\\nare your remarks   and are you going to run away before you have fairly\\ntaught or learned whether they are true or not   is the attempt to\\ndetermine the way of man  s life so small a matter in your eyes—to\\ndetermine how life may be passed by each one of us to the greatest\\nadvantage  \\n\\nand do i differ from you   he said   as to the importance of the enquiry  \\n\\nyou appear rather   i replied   to have no care or thought about us  \\nthrasymachus—whether we live better or worse from not knowing what you\\nsay you know   is to you a matter of indifference   prithee   friend   do\\nnot keep your knowledge to yourself   we are a large party   and any\\nbenefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded   for my own\\npart i openly declare that i am not convinced   and that i do not\\nbelieve injustice to be more gainful than justice   even if uncontrolled\\nand allowed to have free play   for   granting that there may be an\\nunjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraud or force  \\nstill this does not convince me of the superior advantage of injustice  \\nand there may be others who are in the same predicament with myself  \\nperhaps we may be wrong   if so   you in your wisdom should convince us\\nthat we are mistaken in preferring justice to injustice  \\n\\nand how am i to convince you   he said   if you are not already convinced\\nby what i have just said   what more can i do for you   would you have me\\nput the proof bodily into your souls  \\n\\nheaven forbid   i said   i would only ask you to be consistent   or   if\\nyou change   change openly and let there be no deception   for i must\\nremark   thrasymachus   if you will recall what was previously said   that\\nalthough you began by defining the true physician in an exact sense  \\nyou did not observe a like exactness when speaking of the shepherd   you\\nthought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends the sheep not with a view\\nto their own good   but like a mere diner or banquetter with a view to\\nthe pleasures of the table   or   again   as a trader for sale in the\\nmarket   and not as a shepherd   yet surely the art of the shepherd is\\nconcerned only with the good of his subjects   he has only to provide\\nthe best for them   since the perfection of the art is already ensured\\nwhenever all the requirements of it are satisfied   and that was what i\\nwas saying just now about the ruler   i conceived that the art of the\\nruler   considered as ruler   whether in a state or in private life  \\ncould only regard the good of his flock or subjects   whereas you seem\\nto think that the rulers in states   that is to say   the true rulers  \\nlike being in authority  \\n\\nthink   nay   i am sure of it  \\n\\nthen why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly\\nwithout payment   unless under the idea that they govern for the\\nadvantage not of themselves but of others   let me ask you a question  \\nare not the several arts different   by reason of their each having a\\nseparate function   and   my dear illustrious friend   do say what you\\nthink   that we may make a little progress  \\n\\nyes   that is the difference   he replied  \\n\\nand each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general\\none—medicine   for example   gives us health   navigation   safety at sea  \\nand so on  \\n\\nyes   he said  \\n\\nand the art of payment has the special function of giving pay   but we\\ndo not confuse this with other arts   any more than the art of the pilot\\nis to be confused with the art of medicine   because the health of the\\npilot may be improved by a sea voyage   you would not be inclined to\\nsay   would you   that navigation is the art of medicine   at least if we\\nare to adopt your exact use of language  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nor because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not\\nsay that the art of payment is medicine  \\n\\ni should not  \\n\\nnor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a\\nman takes fees when he is engaged in healing  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nand we have admitted   i said   that the good of each art is specially\\nconfined to the art  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthen   if there be any good which all artists have in common   that is to\\nbe attributed to something of which they all have the common use  \\n\\ntrue   he replied  \\n\\nand when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is\\ngained by an additional use of the art of pay   which is not the art\\nprofessed by him  \\n\\nhe gave a reluctant assent to this  \\n\\nthen the pay is not derived by the several artists from their\\nrespective arts   but the truth is   that while the art of medicine gives\\nhealth   and the art of the builder builds a house   another art attends\\nthem which is the art of pay   the various arts may be doing their own\\nbusiness and benefiting that over which they preside   but would the\\nartist receive any benefit from his art unless he were paid as well  \\n\\ni suppose not  \\n\\nbut does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing  \\n\\ncertainly   he confers a benefit  \\n\\nthen now   thrasymachus   there is no longer any doubt that neither arts\\nnor governments provide for their own interests   but   as we were before\\nsaying   they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who\\nare the weaker and not the stronger—to their good they attend and not\\nto the good of the superior   and this is the reason   my dear\\nthrasymachus   why   as i was just now saying   no one is willing to\\ngovern   because no one likes to take in hand the reformation of evils\\nwhich are not his concern without remuneration   for   in the execution\\nof his work   and in giving his orders to another   the true artist does\\nnot regard his own interest   but always that of his subjects   and\\ntherefore in order that rulers may be willing to rule   they must be\\npaid in one of three modes of payment   money   or honour   or a penalty\\nfor refusing  \\n\\nwhat do you mean   socrates   said glaucon   the first two modes of\\npayment are intelligible enough   but what the penalty is i do not\\nunderstand   or how a penalty can be a payment  \\n\\nyou mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment which to\\nthe best men is the great inducement to rule   of course you know that\\nambition and avarice are held to be   as indeed they are   a disgrace  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand for this reason   i said   money and honour have no attraction for\\nthem   good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing\\nand so to get the name of hirelings   nor by secretly helping themselves\\nout of the public revenues to get the name of thieves   and not being\\nambitious they do not care about honour   wherefore necessity must be\\nlaid upon them   and they must be induced to serve from the fear of\\npunishment   and this   as i imagine   is the reason why the forwardness\\nto take office   instead of waiting to be compelled   has been deemed\\ndishonourable   now the worst part of the punishment is that he who\\nrefuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself  \\nand the fear of this   as i conceive   induces the good to take office  \\nnot because they would   but because they cannot help—not under the idea\\nthat they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves   but as\\na necessity   and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling\\nto any one who is better than themselves   or indeed as good   for there\\nis reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men  \\nthen to avoid office would be as much an object of contention as to\\nobtain office is at present   then we should have plain proof that the\\ntrue ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest   but that\\nof his subjects   and every one who knew this would choose rather to\\nreceive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring\\none   so far am i from agreeing with thrasymachus that justice is the\\ninterest of the stronger   this latter question need not be further\\ndiscussed at present   but when thrasymachus says that the life of the\\nunjust is more advantageous than that of the just   his new statement\\nappears to me to be of a far more serious character   which of us has\\nspoken truly   and which sort of life   glaucon   do you prefer  \\n\\ni for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous   he\\nanswered  \\n\\ndid you hear all the advantages of the unjust which thrasymachus was\\nrehearsing  \\n\\nyes   i heard him   he replied   but he has not convinced me  \\n\\nthen shall we try to find some way of convincing him   if we can   that\\nhe is saying what is not true  \\n\\nmost certainly   he replied  \\n\\nif   i said   he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all\\nthe advantages of being just   and he answers and we rejoin   there must\\nbe a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed on either\\nside   and in the end we shall want judges to decide   but if we proceed\\nin our enquiry as we lately did   by making admissions to one another  \\nwe shall unite the offices of judge and advocate in our own persons  \\n\\nvery good   he said  \\n\\nand which method do i understand you to prefer   i said  \\n\\nthat which you propose  \\n\\nwell   then   thrasymachus   i said   suppose you begin at the beginning\\nand answer me   you say that perfect injustice is more gainful than\\nperfect justice  \\n\\nyes   that is what i say   and i have given you my reasons  \\n\\nand what is your view about them   would you call one of them virtue and\\nthe other vice  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\ni suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice  \\n\\nwhat a charming notion   so likely too   seeing that i affirm injustice\\nto be profitable and justice not  \\n\\nwhat else then would you say  \\n\\nthe opposite   he replied  \\n\\nand would you call justice vice  \\n\\nno   i would rather say sublime simplicity  \\n\\nthen would you call injustice malignity  \\n\\nno   i would rather say discretion  \\n\\nand do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good  \\n\\nyes   he said   at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly\\nunjust   and who have the power of subduing states and nations   but\\nperhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses   even this profession\\nif undetected has advantages   though they are not to be compared with\\nthose of which i was just now speaking  \\n\\ni do not think that i misapprehend your meaning   thrasymachus   i\\nreplied   but still i cannot hear without amazement that you class\\ninjustice with wisdom and virtue   and justice with the opposite  \\n\\ncertainly i do so class them  \\n\\nnow   i said   you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable\\nground   for if the injustice which you were maintaining to be\\nprofitable had been admitted by you as by others to be vice and\\ndeformity   an answer might have been given to you on received\\nprinciples   but now i perceive that you will call injustice honourable\\nand strong   and to the unjust you will attribute all the qualities\\nwhich were attributed by us before to the just   seeing that you do not\\nhesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and virtue  \\n\\nyou have guessed most infallibly   he replied  \\n\\nthen i certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the\\nargument so long as i have reason to think that you   thrasymachus   are\\nspeaking your real mind   for i do believe that you are now in earnest\\nand are not amusing yourself at our expense  \\n\\ni may be in earnest or not   but what is that to you  —to refute the\\nargument is your business  \\n\\nvery true   i said   that is what i have to do   but will you be so good\\nas answer yet one more question   does the just man try to gain any\\nadvantage over the just  \\n\\nfar otherwise   if he did he would not be the simple amusing creature\\nwhich he is  \\n\\nand would he try to go beyond just action  \\n\\nhe would not  \\n\\nand how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the\\nunjust   would that be considered by him as just or unjust  \\n\\nhe would think it just   and would try to gain the advantage   but he\\nwould not be able  \\n\\nwhether he would or would not be able   i said   is not to the point   my\\nquestion is only whether the just man   while refusing to have more than\\nanother just man   would wish and claim to have more than the unjust  \\n\\nyes   he would  \\n\\nand what of the unjust—does he claim to have more than the just man and\\nto do more than is just  \\n\\nof course   he said   for he claims to have more than all men  \\n\\nand the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the\\nunjust man or action   in order that he may have more than all  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nwe may put the matter thus   i said—the just does not desire more than\\nhis like but more than his unlike   whereas the unjust desires more than\\nboth his like and his unlike  \\n\\nnothing   he said   can be better than that statement  \\n\\nand the unjust is good and wise   and the just is neither  \\n\\ngood again   he said  \\n\\nand is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike them  \\n\\nof course   he said   he who is of a certain nature   is like those who\\nare of a certain nature   he who is not   not  \\n\\neach of them   i said   is such as his like is  \\n\\ncertainly   he replied  \\n\\nvery good   thrasymachus   i said   and now to take the case of the arts  \\nyou would admit that one man is a musician and another not a musician  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand which is wise and which is foolish  \\n\\nclearly the musician is wise   and he who is not a musician is foolish  \\n\\nand he is good in as far as he is wise   and bad in as far as he is\\nfoolish  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand you would say the same sort of thing of the physician  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand do you think   my excellent friend   that a musician when he adjusts\\nthe lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the\\ntightening and loosening the strings  \\n\\ni do not think that he would  \\n\\nbut he would claim to exceed the non  musician  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nand what would you say of the physician   in prescribing meats and\\ndrinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the\\npractice of medicine  \\n\\nhe would not  \\n\\nbut he would wish to go beyond the non  physician  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand about knowledge and ignorance in general   see whether you think\\nthat any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice of\\nsaying or doing more than another man who has knowledge   would he not\\nrather say or do the same as his like in the same case  \\n\\nthat   i suppose   can hardly be denied  \\n\\nand what of the ignorant   would he not desire to have more than either\\nthe knowing or the ignorant  \\n\\ni dare say  \\n\\nand the knowing is wise  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand the wise is good  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthen the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like   but\\nmore than his unlike and opposite  \\n\\ni suppose so  \\n\\nwhereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nbut did we not say   thrasymachus   that the unjust goes beyond both his\\nlike and unlike   were not these your words  \\n\\nthey were  \\n\\nand you also said that the just will not go beyond his like but his\\nunlike  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthen the just is like the wise and good   and the unjust like the evil\\nand ignorant  \\n\\nthat is the inference  \\n\\nand each of them is such as his like is  \\n\\nthat was admitted  \\n\\nthen the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil\\nand ignorant  \\n\\nthrasymachus made all these admissions   not fluently   as i repeat them  \\nbut with extreme reluctance   it was a hot summer  s day   and the\\nperspiration poured from him in torrents   and then i saw what i had\\nnever seen before   thrasymachus blushing   as we were now agreed that\\njustice was virtue and wisdom   and injustice vice and ignorance   i\\nproceeded to another point  \\n\\nwell   i said   thrasymachus   that matter is now settled   but were we not\\nalso saying that injustice had strength   do you remember  \\n\\nyes   i remember   he said   but do not suppose that i approve of what you\\nare saying or have no answer   if however i were to answer   you would be\\nquite certain to accuse me of haranguing   therefore either permit me to\\nhave my say out   or if you would rather ask   do so   and i will answer\\n  very good     as they say to story  telling old women   and will nod   yes  \\nand   no    \\n\\ncertainly not   i said   if contrary to your real opinion  \\n\\nyes   he said   i will   to please you   since you will not let me speak  \\nwhat else would you have  \\n\\nnothing in the world   i said   and if you are so disposed i will ask and\\nyou shall answer  \\n\\nproceed  \\n\\nthen i will repeat the question which i asked before   in order that our\\nexamination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may be\\ncarried on regularly   a statement was made that injustice is stronger\\nand more powerful than justice   but now justice   having been identified\\nwith wisdom and virtue   is easily shown to be stronger than injustice  \\nif injustice is ignorance   this can no longer be questioned by any one  \\nbut i want to view the matter   thrasymachus   in a different way   you\\nwould not deny that a state may be unjust and may be unjustly\\nattempting to enslave other states   or may have already enslaved them  \\nand may be holding many of them in subjection  \\n\\ntrue   he replied   and i will add that the best and most perfectly\\nunjust state will be most likely to do so  \\n\\ni know   i said   that such was your position   but what i would further\\nconsider is   whether this power which is possessed by the superior\\nstate can exist or be exercised without justice or only with justice  \\n\\nif you are right in your view   and justice is wisdom   then only with\\njustice   but if i am right   then without justice  \\n\\ni am delighted   thrasymachus   to see you not only nodding assent and\\ndissent   but making answers which are quite excellent  \\n\\nthat is out of civility to you   he replied  \\n\\nyou are very kind   i said   and would you have the goodness also to\\ninform me   whether you think that a state   or an army   or a band of\\nrobbers and thieves   or any other gang of evil  doers could act at all\\nif they injured one another  \\n\\nno indeed   he said   they could not  \\n\\nbut if they abstained from injuring one another   then they might act\\ntogether better  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and\\nfighting   and justice imparts harmony and friendship   is not that true  \\nthrasymachus  \\n\\ni agree   he said   because i do not wish to quarrel with you  \\n\\nhow good of you   i said   but i should like to know also whether\\ninjustice   having this tendency to arouse hatred   wherever existing  \\namong slaves or among freemen   will not make them hate one another and\\nset them at variance and render them incapable of common action  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand even if injustice be found in two only   will they not quarrel and\\nfight   and become enemies to one another and to the just  \\n\\nthey will  \\n\\nand suppose injustice abiding in a single person   would your wisdom say\\nthat she loses or that she retains her natural power  \\n\\nlet us assume that she retains her power  \\n\\nyet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that\\nwherever she takes up her abode   whether in a city   in an army   in a\\nfamily   or in any other body   that body is   to begin with   rendered\\nincapable of united action by reason of sedition and distraction   and\\ndoes it not become its own enemy and at variance with all that opposes\\nit   and with the just   is not this the case  \\n\\nyes   certainly  \\n\\nand is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person   in\\nthe first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not at\\nunity with himself   and in the second place making him an enemy to\\nhimself and the just   is not that true   thrasymachus  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand o my friend   i said   surely the gods are just  \\n\\ngranted that they are  \\n\\nbut if so   the unjust will be the enemy of the gods   and the just will\\nbe their friend  \\n\\nfeast away in triumph   and take your fill of the argument   i will not\\noppose you   lest i should displease the company  \\n\\nwell then   proceed with your answers   and let me have the remainder of\\nmy repast   for we have already shown that the just are clearly wiser\\nand better and abler than the unjust   and that the unjust are incapable\\nof common action   nay more   that to speak as we did of men who are evil\\nacting at any time vigorously together   is not strictly true   for if\\nthey had been perfectly evil   they would have laid hands upon one\\nanother   but it is evident that there must have been some remnant of\\njustice in them   which enabled them to combine   if there had not been\\nthey would have injured one another as well as their victims   they were\\nbut half  villains in their enterprises   for had they been whole\\nvillains   and utterly unjust   they would have been utterly incapable of\\naction   that   as i believe   is the truth of the matter   and not what\\nyou said at first   but whether the just have a better and happier life\\nthan the unjust is a further question which we also proposed to\\nconsider   i think that they have   and for the reasons which i have\\ngiven   but still i should like to examine further   for no light matter\\nis at stake   nothing less than the rule of human life  \\n\\nproceed  \\n\\ni will proceed by asking a question   would you not say that a horse has\\nsome end  \\n\\ni should  \\n\\nand the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could\\nnot be accomplished   or not so well accomplished   by any other thing  \\n\\ni do not understand   he said  \\n\\nlet me explain   can you see   except with the eye  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nor hear   except with the ear  \\n\\nno  \\n\\nthese then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs  \\n\\nthey may  \\n\\nbut you can cut off a vine  branch with a dagger or with a chisel   and\\nin many other ways  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nand yet not so well as with a pruning  hook made for the purpose  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nmay we not say that this is the end of a pruning  hook  \\n\\nwe may  \\n\\nthen now i think you will have no difficulty in understanding my\\nmeaning when i asked the question whether the end of anything would be\\nthat which could not be accomplished   or not so well accomplished   by\\nany other thing  \\n\\ni understand your meaning   he said   and assent  \\n\\nand that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence   need i\\nask again whether the eye has an end  \\n\\nit has  \\n\\nand has not the eye an excellence  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand the ear has an end and an excellence also  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand the same is true of all other things   they have each of them an end\\nand a special excellence  \\n\\nthat is so  \\n\\nwell   and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their\\nown proper excellence and have a defect instead  \\n\\nhow can they   he said   if they are blind and cannot see  \\n\\nyou mean to say   if they have lost their proper excellence   which is\\nsight   but i have not arrived at that point yet   i would rather ask the\\nquestion more generally   and only enquire whether the things which\\nfulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence   and fail\\nof fulfilling them by their own defect  \\n\\ncertainly   he replied  \\n\\ni might say the same of the ears   when deprived of their own proper\\nexcellence they cannot fulfil their end  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand the same observation will apply to all other things  \\n\\ni agree  \\n\\nwell   and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil   for\\nexample   to superintend and command and deliberate and the like   are\\nnot these functions proper to the soul   and can they rightly be\\nassigned to any other  \\n\\nto no other  \\n\\nand is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul  \\n\\nassuredly   he said  \\n\\nand has not the soul an excellence also  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that\\nexcellence  \\n\\nshe cannot  \\n\\nthen an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent  \\nand the good soul a good ruler  \\n\\nyes   necessarily  \\n\\nand we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul   and\\ninjustice the defect of the soul  \\n\\nthat has been admitted  \\n\\nthen the just soul and the just man will live well   and the unjust man\\nwill live ill  \\n\\nthat is what your argument proves  \\n\\nand he who lives well is blessed and happy   and he who lives ill the\\nreverse of happy  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nthen the just is happy   and the unjust miserable  \\n\\nso be it  \\n\\nbut happiness and not misery is profitable  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nthen   my blessed thrasymachus   injustice can never be more profitable\\nthan justice  \\n\\nlet this   socrates   he said   be your entertainment at the bendidea  \\n\\nfor which i am indebted to you   i said   now that you have grown gentle\\ntowards me and have left off scolding   nevertheless   i have not been\\nwell entertained   but that was my own fault and not yours   as an\\nepicure snatches a taste of every dish which is successively brought to\\ntable   he not having allowed himself time to enjoy the one before   so\\nhave i gone from one subject to another without having discovered what\\ni sought at first   the nature of justice   i left that enquiry and\\nturned away to consider whether justice is virtue and wisdom or evil\\nand folly   and when there arose a further question about the\\ncomparative advantages of justice and injustice   i could not refrain\\nfrom passing on to that   and the result of the whole discussion has\\nbeen that i know nothing at all   for i know not what justice is   and\\ntherefore i am not likely to know whether it is or is not a virtue   nor\\ncan i say whether the just man is happy or unhappy  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book ii  \\n\\n\\nwith these words i was thinking that i had made an end of the\\ndiscussion   but the end   in truth   proved to be only a beginning   for\\nglaucon   who is always the most pugnacious of men   was dissatisfied at\\nthrasymachus   retirement   he wanted to have the battle out   so he said\\nto me   socrates   do you wish really to persuade us   or only to seem to\\nhave persuaded us   that to be just is always better than to be unjust  \\n\\ni should wish really to persuade you   i replied   if i could  \\n\\nthen you certainly have not succeeded   let me ask you now  —how would\\nyou arrange goods—are there not some which we welcome for their own\\nsakes   and independently of their consequences   as   for example  \\nharmless pleasures and enjoyments   which delight us at the time  \\nalthough nothing follows from them  \\n\\ni agree in thinking that there is such a class   i replied  \\n\\nis there not also a second class of goods   such as knowledge   sight  \\nhealth   which are desirable not only in themselves   but also for their\\nresults  \\n\\ncertainly   i said  \\n\\nand would you not recognize a third class   such as gymnastic   and the\\ncare of the sick   and the physician  s art   also the various ways of\\nmoney  making—these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable   and\\nno one would choose them for their own sakes   but only for the sake of\\nsome reward or result which flows from them  \\n\\nthere is   i said   this third class also   but why do you ask  \\n\\nbecause i want to know in which of the three classes you would place\\njustice  \\n\\nin the highest class   i replied  —among those goods which he who would\\nbe happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their\\nresults  \\n\\nthen the many are of another mind   they think that justice is to be\\nreckoned in the troublesome class   among goods which are to be pursued\\nfor the sake of rewards and of reputation   but in themselves are\\ndisagreeable and rather to be avoided  \\n\\ni know   i said   that this is their manner of thinking   and that this\\nwas the thesis which thrasymachus was maintaining just now   when he\\ncensured justice and praised injustice   but i am too stupid to be\\nconvinced by him  \\n\\ni wish   he said   that you would hear me as well as him   and then i\\nshall see whether you and i agree   for thrasymachus seems to me   like a\\nsnake   to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have\\nbeen   but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet\\nbeen made clear   setting aside their rewards and results   i want to\\nknow what they are in themselves   and how they inwardly work in the\\nsoul   if you   please   then   i will revive the argument of thrasymachus  \\nand first i will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to\\nthe common view of them   secondly   i will show that all men who\\npractise justice do so against their will   of necessity   but not as a\\ngood   and thirdly   i will argue that there is reason in this view   for\\nthe life of the unjust is after all better far than the life of the\\njust—if what they say is true   socrates   since i myself am not of their\\nopinion   but still i acknowledge that i am perplexed when i hear the\\nvoices of thrasymachus and myriads of others dinning in my ears   and  \\non the other hand   i have never yet heard the superiority of justice to\\ninjustice maintained by any one in a satisfactory way   i want to hear\\njustice praised in respect of itself   then i shall be satisfied   and\\nyou are the person from whom i think that i am most likely to hear\\nthis   and therefore i will praise the unjust life to the utmost of my\\npower   and my manner of speaking will indicate the manner in which i\\ndesire to hear you too praising justice and censuring injustice   will\\nyou say whether you approve of my proposal  \\n\\nindeed i do   nor can i imagine any theme about which a man of sense\\nwould oftener wish to converse  \\n\\ni am delighted   he replied   to hear you say so   and shall begin by\\nspeaking   as i proposed   of the nature and origin of justice  \\n\\nthey say that to do injustice is   by nature   good   to suffer injustice  \\nevil   but that the evil is greater than the good   and so when men have\\nboth done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both   not\\nbeing able to avoid the one and obtain the other   they think that they\\nhad better agree among themselves to have neither   hence there arise\\nlaws and mutual covenants   and that which is ordained by law is termed\\nby them lawful and just   this they affirm to be the origin and nature\\nof justice  —it is a mean or compromise   between the best of all   which\\nis to do injustice and not be punished   and the worst of all   which is\\nto suffer injustice without the power of retaliation   and justice  \\nbeing at a middle point between the two   is tolerated not as a good  \\nbut as the lesser evil   and honoured by reason of the inability of men\\nto do injustice   for no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever\\nsubmit to such an agreement if he were able to resist   he would be mad\\nif he did   such is the received account   socrates   of the nature and\\norigin of justice  \\n\\nnow that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because\\nthey have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine\\nsomething of this kind   having given both to the just and the unjust\\npower to do what they will   let us watch and see whither desire will\\nlead them   then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust\\nman to be proceeding along the same road   following their interest  \\nwhich all natures deem to be their good   and are only diverted into the\\npath of justice by the force of law   the liberty which we are supposing\\nmay be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is\\nsaid to have been possessed by gyges   the ancestor of croesus the\\nlydian   according to the tradition   gyges was a shepherd in the service\\nof the king of lydia   there was a great storm   and an earthquake made\\nan opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock  \\namazed at the sight   he descended into the opening   where   among other\\nmarvels   he beheld a hollow brazen horse   having doors   at which he\\nstooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature   as appeared to him  \\nmore than human   and having nothing on but a gold ring   this he took\\nfrom the finger of the dead and reascended   now the shepherds met\\ntogether   according to custom   that they might send their monthly\\nreport about the flocks to the king   into their assembly he came having\\nthe ring on his finger   and as he was sitting among them he chanced to\\nturn the collet of the ring inside his hand   when instantly he became\\ninvisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as\\nif he were no longer present   he was astonished at this   and again\\ntouching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared   he made\\nseveral trials of the ring   and always with the same result—when he\\nturned the collet inwards he became invisible   when outwards he\\nreappeared   whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers\\nwho were sent to the court   whereas soon as he arrived he seduced the\\nqueen   and with her help conspired against the king and slew him   and\\ntook the kingdom   suppose now that there were two such magic rings   and\\nthe just put on one of them and the unjust the other   no man can be\\nimagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in\\njustice   no man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he\\ncould safely take what he liked out of the market   or go into houses\\nand lie with any one at his pleasure   or kill or release from prison\\nwhom he would   and in all respects be like a god among men   then the\\nactions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust   they would\\nboth come at last to the same point   and this we may truly affirm to be\\na great proof that a man is just   not willingly or because he thinks\\nthat justice is any good to him individually   but of necessity   for\\nwherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust   there he is\\nunjust   for all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more\\nprofitable to the individual than justice   and he who argues as i have\\nbeen supposing   will say that they are right   if you could imagine any\\none obtaining this power of becoming invisible   and never doing any\\nwrong or touching what was another  s   he would be thought by the\\nlookers  on to be a most wretched idiot   although they would praise him\\nto one another  s faces   and keep up appearances with one another from a\\nfear that they too might suffer injustice   enough of this  \\n\\nnow   if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and\\nunjust   we must isolate them   there is no other way   and how is the\\nisolation to be effected   i answer   let the unjust man be entirely\\nunjust   and the just man entirely just   nothing is to be taken away\\nfrom either of them   and both are to be perfectly furnished for the\\nwork of their respective lives   first   let the unjust be like other\\ndistinguished masters of craft   like the skilful pilot or physician  \\nwho knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits   and\\nwho   if he fails at any point   is able to recover himself   so let the\\nunjust make his unjust attempts in the right way   and lie hidden if he\\nmeans to be great in his injustice     he who is found out is nobody    \\nfor the highest reach of injustice is   to be deemed just when you are\\nnot   therefore i say that in the perfectly unjust man we must assume\\nthe most perfect injustice   there is to be no deduction   but we must\\nallow him   while doing the most unjust acts   to have acquired the\\ngreatest reputation for justice   if he have taken a false step he must\\nbe able to recover himself   he must be one who can speak with effect  \\nif any of his deeds come to light   and who can force his way where\\nforce is required by his courage and strength   and command of money and\\nfriends   and at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and\\nsimplicity   wishing   as aeschylus says   to be and not to seem good  \\nthere must be no seeming   for if he seem to be just he will be honoured\\nand rewarded   and then we shall not know whether he is just for the\\nsake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards   therefore   let\\nhim be clothed in justice only   and have no other covering   and he must\\nbe imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former   let him be\\nthe best of men   and let him be thought the worst   then he will have\\nbeen put to the proof   and we shall see whether he will be affected by\\nthe fear of infamy and its consequences   and let him continue thus to\\nthe hour of death   being just and seeming to be unjust   when both have\\nreached the uttermost extreme   the one of justice and the other of\\ninjustice   let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the\\ntwo  \\n\\nheavens   my dear glaucon   i said   how energetically you polish them up\\nfor the decision   first one and then the other   as if they were two\\nstatues  \\n\\ni do my best   he said   and now that we know what they are like there is\\nno difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either of\\nthem   this i will proceed to describe   but as you may think the\\ndescription a little too coarse   i ask you to suppose   socrates   that\\nthe words which follow are not mine  —let me put them into the mouths of\\nthe eulogists of injustice   they will tell you that the just man who is\\nthought unjust will be scourged   racked   bound—will have his eyes burnt\\nout   and   at last   after suffering every kind of evil   he will be\\nimpaled   then he will understand that he ought to seem only   and not to\\nbe   just   the words of aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust\\nthan of the just   for the unjust is pursuing a reality   he does not\\nlive with a view to appearances—he wants to be really unjust and not to\\nseem only  —\\n\\n  his mind has a soil deep and fertile   out of which spring his prudent\\ncounsels    \\n\\nin the first place   he is thought just   and therefore bears rule in the\\ncity   he can marry whom he will   and give in marriage to whom he will  \\nalso he can trade and deal where he likes   and always to his own\\nadvantage   because he has no misgivings about injustice   and at every\\ncontest   whether in public or private   he gets the better of his\\nantagonists   and gains at their expense   and is rich   and out of his\\ngains he can benefit his friends   and harm his enemies   moreover   he\\ncan offer sacrifices   and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and\\nmagnificently   and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to\\nhonour in a far better style than the just   and therefore he is likely\\nto be dearer than they are to the gods   and thus   socrates   gods and\\nmen are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the\\nlife of the just  \\n\\ni was going to say something in answer to glaucon   when adeimantus   his\\nbrother   interposed   socrates   he said   you do not suppose that there\\nis nothing more to be urged  \\n\\nwhy   what else is there   i answered  \\n\\nthe strongest point of all has not been even mentioned   he replied  \\n\\nwell   then   according to the proverb     let brother help brother  —if he\\nfails in any part do you assist him   although i must confess that\\nglaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust   and take\\nfrom me the power of helping justice  \\n\\nnonsense   he replied   but let me add something more   there is another\\nside to glaucon  s argument about the praise and censure of justice and\\ninjustice   which is equally required in order to bring out what i\\nbelieve to be his meaning   parents and tutors are always telling their\\nsons and their wards that they are to be just   but why   not for the\\nsake of justice   but for the sake of character and reputation   in the\\nhope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices  \\nmarriages   and the like which glaucon has enumerated among the\\nadvantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice   more  \\nhowever   is made of appearances by this class of persons than by the\\nothers   for they throw in the good opinion of the gods   and will tell\\nyou of a shower of benefits which the heavens   as they say   rain upon\\nthe pious   and this accords with the testimony of the noble hesiod and\\nhomer   the first of whom says   that the gods make the oaks of the just—\\n\\n   to bear acorns at their summit   and bees in the middle  \\nand the sheep are bowed down with the weight of their fleeces    \\n\\n\\nand many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them   and\\nhomer has a very similar strain   for he speaks of one whose fame is—\\n\\n  as the fame of some blameless king who   like a god   maintains justice  \\nto whom the black earth brings forth wheat and barley   whose trees are\\nbowed with fruit   and his sheep never fail to bear   and the sea gives\\nhim fish    \\n\\nstill grander are the gifts of heaven which musaeus and his son\\nvouchsafe to the just   they take them down into the world below   where\\nthey have the saints lying on couches at a feast   everlastingly drunk  \\ncrowned with garlands   their idea seems to be that an immortality of\\ndrunkenness is the highest meed of virtue   some extend their rewards\\nyet further   the posterity   as they say   of the faithful and just shall\\nsurvive to the third and fourth generation   this is the style in which\\nthey praise justice   but about the wicked there is another strain   they\\nbury them in a slough in hades   and make them carry water in a sieve  \\nalso while they are yet living they bring them to infamy   and inflict\\nupon them the punishments which glaucon described as the portion of the\\njust who are reputed to be unjust   nothing else does their invention\\nsupply   such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the\\nother  \\n\\nonce more   socrates   i will ask you to consider another way of speaking\\nabout justice and injustice   which is not confined to the poets   but is\\nfound in prose writers   the universal voice of mankind is always\\ndeclaring that justice and virtue are honourable   but grievous and\\ntoilsome   and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of\\nattainment   and are only censured by law and opinion   they say also\\nthat honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty   and\\nthey are quite ready to call wicked men happy   and to honour them both\\nin public and private when they are rich or in any other way\\ninfluential   while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and\\npoor   even though acknowledging them to be better than the others   but\\nmost extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and\\nthe gods   they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many\\ngood men   and good and happiness to the wicked   and mendicant prophets\\ngo to rich men  s doors and persuade them that they have a power\\ncommitted to them by the gods of making an atonement for a man  s own or\\nhis ancestor  s sins by sacrifices or charms   with rejoicings and\\nfeasts   and they promise to harm an enemy   whether just or unjust   at a\\nsmall cost   with magic arts and incantations binding heaven   as they\\nsay   to execute their will   and the poets are the authorities to whom\\nthey appeal   now smoothing the path of vice with the words of hesiod  —\\n\\n  vice may be had in abundance without trouble   the way is smooth and\\nher dwelling  place is near   but before virtue the gods have set toil    \\n\\nand a tedious and uphill road   then citing homer as a witness that the\\ngods may be influenced by men   for he also says  —\\n\\n  the gods   too   may be turned from their purpose   and men pray to them\\nand avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties   and by\\nlibations and the odour of fat   when they have sinned and\\ntransgressed    \\n\\nand they produce a host of books written by musaeus and orpheus   who\\nwere children of the moon and the muses—that is what they say—according\\nto which they perform their ritual   and persuade not only individuals  \\nbut whole cities   that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by\\nsacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour   and are equally at\\nthe service of the living and the dead   the latter sort they call\\nmysteries   and they redeem us from the pains of hell   but if we neglect\\nthem no one knows what awaits us  \\n\\nhe proceeded   and now when the young hear all this said about virtue\\nand vice   and the way in which gods and men regard them   how are their\\nminds likely to be affected   my dear socrates  —those of them   i mean  \\nwho are quickwitted   and   like bees on the wing   light on every flower  \\nand from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what\\nmanner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if\\nthey would make the best of life   probably the youth will say to\\nhimself in the words of pindar—\\n\\n  can i by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower\\nwhich may be a fortress to me all my days    \\n\\nfor what men say is that   if i am really just and am not also thought\\njust profit there is none   but the pain and loss on the other hand are\\nunmistakeable   but if   though unjust   i acquire the reputation of\\njustice   a heavenly life is promised to me   since then   as philosophers\\nprove   appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness   to\\nappearance i must devote myself   i will describe around me a picture\\nand shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my house  \\nbehind i will trail the subtle and crafty fox   as archilochus   greatest\\nof sages   recommends   but i hear some one exclaiming that the\\nconcealment of wickedness is often difficult   to which i answer  \\nnothing great is easy   nevertheless   the argument indicates this   if we\\nwould be happy   to be the path along which we should proceed   with a\\nview to concealment we will establish secret brotherhoods and political\\nclubs   and there are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of\\npersuading courts and assemblies   and so   partly by persuasion and\\npartly by force   i shall make unlawful gains and not be punished   still\\ni hear a voice saying that the gods cannot be deceived   neither can\\nthey be compelled   but what if there are no gods   or   suppose them to\\nhave no care of human things—why in either case should we mind about\\nconcealment   and even if there are gods   and they do care about us   yet\\nwe know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the poets  \\nand these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced and\\nturned by   sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings     let us\\nbe consistent then   and believe both or neither   if the poets speak\\ntruly   why then we had better be unjust   and offer of the fruits of\\ninjustice   for if we are just   although we may escape the vengeance of\\nheaven   we shall lose the gains of injustice   but   if we are unjust   we\\nshall keep the gains   and by our sinning and praying   and praying and\\nsinning   the gods will be propitiated   and we shall not be punished  \\n  but there is a world below in which either we or our posterity will\\nsuffer for our unjust deeds     yes   my friend   will be the reflection  \\nbut there are mysteries and atoning deities   and these have great\\npower   that is what mighty cities declare   and the children of the\\ngods   who were their poets and prophets   bear a like testimony  \\n\\non what principle   then   shall we any longer choose justice rather than\\nthe worst injustice   when   if we only unite the latter with a deceitful\\nregard to appearances   we shall fare to our mind both with gods and\\nmen   in life and after death   as the most numerous and the highest\\nauthorities tell us   knowing all this   socrates   how can a man who has\\nany superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth   be willing to\\nhonour justice   or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears\\njustice praised   and even if there should be some one who is able to\\ndisprove the truth of my words   and who is satisfied that justice is\\nbest   still he is not angry with the unjust   but is very ready to\\nforgive them   because he also knows that men are not just of their own\\nfree will   unless   peradventure   there be some one whom the divinity\\nwithin him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice   or who has\\nattained knowledge of the truth—but no other man   he only blames\\ninjustice who   owing to cowardice or age or some weakness   has not the\\npower of being unjust   and this is proved by the fact that when he\\nobtains the power   he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be  \\n\\nthe cause of all this   socrates   was indicated by us at the beginning\\nof the argument   when my brother and i told you how astonished we were\\nto find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice—beginning\\nwith the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us  \\nand ending with the men of our own time—no one has ever blamed\\ninjustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories  \\nhonours   and benefits which flow from them   no one has ever adequately\\ndescribed either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either\\nof them abiding in the soul   and invisible to any human or divine eye  \\nor shown that of all the things of a man  s soul which he has within\\nhim   justice is the greatest good   and injustice the greatest evil   had\\nthis been the universal strain   had you sought to persuade us of this\\nfrom our youth upwards   we should not have been on the watch to keep\\none another from doing wrong   but every one would have been his own\\nwatchman   because afraid   if he did wrong   of harbouring in himself the\\ngreatest of evils   i dare say that thrasymachus and others would\\nseriously hold the language which i have been merely repeating   and\\nwords even stronger than these about justice and injustice   grossly   as\\ni conceive   perverting their true nature   but i speak in this vehement\\nmanner   as i must frankly confess to you   because i want to hear from\\nyou the opposite side   and i would ask you to show not only the\\nsuperiority which justice has over injustice   but what effect they have\\non the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other\\nan evil to him   and please   as glaucon requested of you   to exclude\\nreputations   for unless you take away from each of them his true\\nreputation and add on the false   we shall say that you do not praise\\njustice   but the appearance of it   we shall think that you are only\\nexhorting us to keep injustice dark   and that you really agree with\\nthrasymachus in thinking that justice is another  s good and the\\ninterest of the stronger   and that injustice is a man  s own profit and\\ninterest   though injurious to the weaker   now as you have admitted that\\njustice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed\\nfor their results   but in a far greater degree for their own sakes—like\\nsight or hearing or knowledge or health   or any other real and natural\\nand not merely conventional good—i would ask you in your praise of\\njustice to regard one point only   i mean the essential good and evil\\nwhich justice and injustice work in the possessors of them   let others\\npraise justice and censure injustice   magnifying the rewards and\\nhonours of the one and abusing the other   that is a manner of arguing\\nwhich   coming from them   i am ready to tolerate   but from you who have\\nspent your whole life in the consideration of this question   unless i\\nhear the contrary from your own lips   i expect something better   and\\ntherefore   i say   not only prove to us that justice is better than\\ninjustice   but show what they either of them do to the possessor of\\nthem   which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil   whether\\nseen or unseen by gods and men  \\n\\ni had always admired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus   but on\\nhearing these words i was quite delighted   and said   sons of an\\nillustrious father   that was not a bad beginning of the elegiac verses\\nwhich the admirer of glaucon made in honour of you after you had\\ndistinguished yourselves at the battle of megara  —\\n\\n  sons of ariston     he sang     divine offspring of an illustrious hero    \\n\\nthe epithet is very appropriate   for there is something truly divine in\\nbeing able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice  \\nand remaining unconvinced by your own arguments   and i do believe that\\nyou are not convinced—this i infer from your general character   for had\\ni judged only from your speeches i should have mistrusted you   but now  \\nthe greater my confidence in you   the greater is my difficulty in\\nknowing what to say   for i am in a strait between two   on the one hand\\ni feel that i am unequal to the task   and my inability is brought home\\nto me by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which i\\nmade to thrasymachus   proving   as i thought   the superiority which\\njustice has over injustice   and yet i cannot refuse to help   while\\nbreath and speech remain to me   i am afraid that there would be an\\nimpiety in being present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting\\nup a hand in her defence   and therefore i had best give such help as i\\ncan  \\n\\nglaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question\\ndrop   but to proceed in the investigation   they wanted to arrive at the\\ntruth   first   about the nature of justice and injustice   and secondly  \\nabout their relative advantages   i told them   what i really thought  \\nthat the enquiry would be of a serious nature   and would require very\\ngood eyes   seeing then   i said   that we are no great wits   i think that\\nwe had better adopt a method which i may illustrate thus   suppose that\\na short  sighted person had been asked by some one to read small letters\\nfrom a distance   and it occurred to some one else that they might be\\nfound in another place which was larger and in which the letters were\\nlarger—if they were the same and he could read the larger letters\\nfirst   and then proceed to the lesser—this would have been thought a\\nrare piece of good fortune  \\n\\nvery true   said adeimantus   but how does the illustration apply to our\\nenquiry  \\n\\ni will tell you   i replied   justice   which is the subject of our\\nenquiry   is   as you know   sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an\\nindividual   and sometimes as the virtue of a state  \\n\\ntrue   he replied  \\n\\nand is not a state larger than an individual  \\n\\nit is  \\n\\nthen in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and\\nmore easily discernible   i propose therefore that we enquire into the\\nnature of justice and injustice   first as they appear in the state   and\\nsecondly in the individual   proceeding from the greater to the lesser\\nand comparing them  \\n\\nthat   he said   is an excellent proposal  \\n\\nand if we imagine the state in process of creation   we shall see the\\njustice and injustice of the state in process of creation also  \\n\\ni dare say  \\n\\nwhen the state is completed there may be a hope that the object of our\\nsearch will be more easily discovered  \\n\\nyes   far more easily  \\n\\nbut ought we to attempt to construct one   i said   for to do so   as i am\\ninclined to think   will be a very serious task   reflect therefore  \\n\\ni have reflected   said adeimantus   and am anxious that you should\\nproceed  \\n\\na state   i said   arises   as i conceive   out of the needs of mankind   no\\none is self  sufficing   but all of us have many wants   can any other\\norigin of a state be imagined  \\n\\nthere can be no other  \\n\\nthen   as we have many wants   and many persons are needed to supply\\nthem   one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another   and\\nwhen these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation\\nthe body of inhabitants is termed a state  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nand they exchange with one another   and one gives   and another\\nreceives   under the idea that the exchange will be for their good  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nthen   i said   let us begin and create in idea a state   and yet the true\\ncreator is necessity   who is the mother of our invention  \\n\\nof course   he replied  \\n\\nnow the first and greatest of necessities is food   which is the\\ncondition of life and existence  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nthe second is a dwelling   and the third clothing and the like  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great\\ndemand   we may suppose that one man is a husbandman   another a builder  \\nsome one else a weaver—shall we add to them a shoemaker   or perhaps\\nsome other purveyor to our bodily wants  \\n\\nquite right  \\n\\nthe barest notion of a state must include four or five men  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nand how will they proceed   will each bring the result of his labours\\ninto a common stock  —the individual husbandman   for example   producing\\nfor four   and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in\\nthe provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself  \\nor will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of\\nproducing for them   but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food\\nin a fourth of the time   and in the remaining three fourths of his time\\nbe employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes   having no\\npartnership with others   but supplying himself all his own wants  \\n\\nadeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at\\nproducing everything  \\n\\nprobably   i replied   that would be the better way   and when i hear you\\nsay this   i am myself reminded that we are not all alike   there are\\ndiversities of natures among us which are adapted to different\\noccupations  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand will you have a work better done when the workman has many\\noccupations   or when he has only one  \\n\\nwhen he has only one  \\n\\nfurther   there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at\\nthe right time  \\n\\nno doubt  \\n\\nfor business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is\\nat leisure   but the doer must follow up what he is doing   and make the\\nbusiness his first object  \\n\\nhe must  \\n\\nand if so   we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully\\nand easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is\\nnatural to him and does it at the right time   and leaves other things  \\n\\nundoubtedly  \\n\\nthen more than four citizens will be required   for the husbandman will\\nnot make his own plough or mattock   or other implements of agriculture  \\nif they are to be good for anything   neither will the builder make his\\ntools—and he too needs many   and in like manner the weaver and\\nshoemaker  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthen carpenters   and smiths   and many other artisans   will be sharers\\nin our little state   which is already beginning to grow  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nyet even if we add neatherds   shepherds   and other herdsmen   in order\\nthat our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with   and builders as well\\nas husbandmen may have draught cattle   and curriers and weavers fleeces\\nand hides  —still our state will not be very large  \\n\\nthat is true   yet neither will it be a very small state which contains\\nall these  \\n\\nthen   again   there is the situation of the city—to find a place where\\nnothing need be imported is wellnigh impossible  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nthen there must be another class of citizens who will bring the\\nrequired supply from another city  \\n\\nthere must  \\n\\nbut if the trader goes empty  handed   having nothing which they require\\nwho would supply his need   he will come back empty  handed  \\n\\nthat is certain  \\n\\nand therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for\\nthemselves   but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate\\nthose from whom their wants are supplied  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nthen more husbandmen and more artisans will be required  \\n\\nthey will  \\n\\nnot to mention the importers and exporters   who are called merchants  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthen we shall want merchants  \\n\\nwe shall  \\n\\nand if merchandise is to be carried over the sea   skilful sailors will\\nalso be needed   and in considerable numbers  \\n\\nyes   in considerable numbers  \\n\\nthen   again   within the city   how will they exchange their productions  \\nto secure such an exchange was   as you will remember   one of our\\nprincipal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a\\nstate  \\n\\nclearly they will buy and sell  \\n\\nthen they will need a market  place   and a money  token for purposes of\\nexchange  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nsuppose now that a husbandman   or an artisan   brings some production to\\nmarket   and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with\\nhim  —is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the market  place  \\n\\nnot at all   he will find people there who   seeing the want   undertake\\nthe office of salesmen   in well  ordered states they are commonly those\\nwho are the weakest in bodily strength   and therefore of little use for\\nany other purpose   their duty is to be in the market   and to give money\\nin exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money\\nfrom those who desire to buy  \\n\\nthis want   then   creates a class of retail  traders in our state   is not\\n  retailer   the term which is applied to those who sit in the\\nmarket  place engaged in buying and selling   while those who wander from\\none city to another are called merchants  \\n\\nyes   he said  \\n\\nand there is another class of servants   who are intellectually hardly\\non the level of companionship   still they have plenty of bodily\\nstrength for labour   which accordingly they sell   and are called   if i\\ndo not mistake   hirelings   hire being the name which is given to the\\nprice of their labour  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthen hirelings will help to make up our population  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand now   adeimantus   is our state matured and perfected  \\n\\ni think so  \\n\\nwhere   then   is justice   and where is injustice   and in what part of\\nthe state did they spring up  \\n\\nprobably in the dealings of these citizens with one another   i cannot\\nimagine that they are more likely to be found any where else  \\n\\ni dare say that you are right in your suggestion   i said   we had better\\nthink the matter out   and not shrink from the enquiry  \\n\\nlet us then consider   first of all   what will be their way of life   now\\nthat we have thus established them   will they not produce corn   and\\nwine   and clothes   and shoes   and build houses for themselves   and when\\nthey are housed   they will work   in summer   commonly   stripped and\\nbarefoot   but in winter substantially clothed and shod   they will feed\\non barley  meal and flour of wheat   baking and kneading them   making\\nnoble cakes and loaves   these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or\\non clean leaves   themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with\\nyew or myrtle   and they and their children will feast   drinking of the\\nwine which they have made   wearing garlands on their heads   and hymning\\nthe praises of the gods   in happy converse with one another   and they\\nwill take care that their families do not exceed their means   having an\\neye to poverty or war  \\n\\nbut   said glaucon   interposing   you have not given them a relish to\\ntheir meal  \\n\\ntrue   i replied   i had forgotten   of course they must have a\\nrelish—salt   and olives   and cheese   and they will boil roots and herbs\\nsuch as country people prepare   for a dessert we shall give them figs  \\nand peas   and beans   and they will roast myrtle  berries and acorns at\\nthe fire   drinking in moderation   and with such a diet they may be\\nexpected to live in peace and health to a good old age   and bequeath a\\nsimilar life to their children after them  \\n\\nyes   socrates   he said   and if you were providing for a city of pigs  \\nhow else would you feed the beasts  \\n\\nbut what would you have   glaucon   i replied  \\n\\nwhy   he said   you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life  \\npeople who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas   and\\ndine off tables   and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern\\nstyle  \\n\\nyes   i said   now i understand   the question which you would have me\\nconsider is   not only how a state   but how a luxurious state is\\ncreated   and possibly there is no harm in this   for in such a state we\\nshall be more likely to see how justice and injustice originate   in my\\nopinion the true and healthy constitution of the state is the one which\\ni have described   but if you wish also to see a state at fever  heat   i\\nhave no objection   for i suspect that many will not be satisfied with\\nthe simpler way of life   they will be for adding sofas   and tables   and\\nother furniture   also dainties   and perfumes   and incense   and\\ncourtesans   and cakes   all these not of one sort only   but in every\\nvariety   we must go beyond the necessaries of which i was at first\\nspeaking   such as houses   and clothes   and shoes   the arts of the\\npainter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion   and gold and\\nivory and all sorts of materials must be procured  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nthen we must enlarge our borders   for the original healthy state is no\\nlonger sufficient   now will the city have to fill and swell with a\\nmultitude of callings which are not required by any natural want   such\\nas the whole tribe of hunters and actors   of whom one large class have\\nto do with forms and colours   another will be the votaries of\\nmusic—poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists   players   dancers  \\ncontractors   also makers of divers kinds of articles   including women  s\\ndresses   and we shall want more servants   will not tutors be also in\\nrequest   and nurses wet and dry   tirewomen and barbers   as well as\\nconfectioners and cooks   and swineherds   too   who were not needed and\\ntherefore had no place in the former edition of our state   but are\\nneeded now   they must not be forgotten   and there will be animals of\\nmany other kinds   if people eat them  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians\\nthan before  \\n\\nmuch greater  \\n\\nand the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants\\nwill be too small now   and not enough  \\n\\nquite true  \\n\\nthen a slice of our neighbours   land will be wanted by us for pasture\\nand tillage   and they will want a slice of ours   if   like ourselves  \\nthey exceed the limit of necessity   and give themselves up to the\\nunlimited accumulation of wealth  \\n\\nthat   socrates   will be inevitable  \\n\\nand so we shall go to war   glaucon   shall we not  \\n\\nmost certainly   he replied  \\n\\nthen without determining as yet whether war does good or harm   thus\\nmuch we may affirm   that now we have discovered war to be derived from\\ncauses which are also the causes of almost all the evils in states  \\nprivate as well as public  \\n\\nundoubtedly  \\n\\nand our state must once more enlarge   and this time the enlargement\\nwill be nothing short of a whole army   which will have to go out and\\nfight with the invaders for all that we have   as well as for the things\\nand persons whom we were describing above  \\n\\nwhy   he said   are they not capable of defending themselves  \\n\\nno   i said   not if we were right in the principle which was\\nacknowledged by all of us when we were framing the state   the\\nprinciple   as you will remember   was that one man cannot practise many\\narts with success  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nbut is not war an art  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking  \\n\\nquite true  \\n\\nand the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be a husbandman   or a\\nweaver   or a builder—in order that we might have our shoes well made  \\nbut to him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he\\nwas by nature fitted   and at that he was to continue working all his\\nlife long and at no other   he was not to let opportunities slip   and\\nthen he would become a good workman   now nothing can be more important\\nthan that the work of a soldier should be well done   but is war an art\\nso easily acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a\\nhusbandman   or shoemaker   or other artisan   although no one in the\\nworld would be a good dice or draught player who merely took up the\\ngame as a recreation   and had not from his earliest years devoted\\nhimself to this and nothing else   no tools will make a man a skilled\\nworkman   or master of defence   nor be of any use to him who has not\\nlearned how to handle them   and has never bestowed any attention upon\\nthem   how then will he who takes up a shield or other implement of war\\nbecome a good fighter all in a day   whether with heavy  armed or any\\nother kind of troops  \\n\\nyes   he said   the tools which would teach men their own use would be\\nbeyond price  \\n\\nand the higher the duties of the guardian   i said   the more time   and\\nskill   and art   and application will be needed by him  \\n\\nno doubt   he replied  \\n\\nwill he not also require natural aptitude for his calling  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nthen it will be our duty to select   if we can   natures which are fitted\\nfor the task of guarding the city  \\n\\nit will  \\n\\nand the selection will be no easy matter   i said   but we must be brave\\nand do our best  \\n\\nwe must  \\n\\nis not the noble youth very like a well  bred dog in respect of guarding\\nand watching  \\n\\nwhat do you mean  \\n\\ni mean that both of them ought to be quick to see   and swift to\\novertake the enemy when they see him   and strong too if   when they have\\ncaught him   they have to fight with him  \\n\\nall these qualities   he replied   will certainly be required by them  \\n\\nwell   and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand is he likely to be brave who has no spirit   whether horse or dog or\\nany other animal   have you never observed how invincible and\\nunconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of\\nany creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable  \\n\\ni have  \\n\\nthen now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are\\nrequired in the guardian  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand also of the mental ones   his soul is to be full of spirit  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nbut are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another  \\nand with everybody else  \\n\\na difficulty by no means easy to overcome   he replied  \\n\\nwhereas   i said   they ought to be dangerous to their enemies   and\\ngentle to their friends   if not   they will destroy themselves without\\nwaiting for their enemies to destroy them  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nwhat is to be done then   i said   how shall we find a gentle nature\\nwhich has also a great spirit   for the one is the contradiction of the\\nother  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nhe will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two\\nqualities   and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible  \\nand hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible  \\n\\ni am afraid that what you say is true   he replied  \\n\\nhere feeling perplexed i began to think over what had preceded  —my\\nfriend   i said   no wonder that we are in a perplexity   for we have lost\\nsight of the image which we had before us  \\n\\nwhat do you mean   he said  \\n\\ni mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite\\nqualities  \\n\\nand where do you find them  \\n\\nmany animals   i replied   furnish examples of them   our friend the dog\\nis a very good one   you know that well  bred dogs are perfectly gentle\\nto their familiars and acquaintances   and the reverse to strangers  \\n\\nyes   i know  \\n\\nthen there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our\\nfinding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nwould not he who is fitted to be a guardian   besides the spirited\\nnature   need to have the qualities of a philosopher  \\n\\ni do not apprehend your meaning  \\n\\nthe trait of which i am speaking   i replied   may be also seen in the\\ndog   and is remarkable in the animal  \\n\\nwhat trait  \\n\\nwhy   a dog   whenever he sees a stranger   is angry   when an\\nacquaintance   he welcomes him   although the one has never done him any\\nharm   nor the other any good   did this never strike you as curious  \\n\\nthe matter never struck me before   but i quite recognise the truth of\\nyour remark  \\n\\nand surely this instinct of the dog is very charming  —your dog is a\\ntrue philosopher  \\n\\nwhy  \\n\\nwhy   because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only\\nby the criterion of knowing and not knowing   and must not an animal be\\na lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the\\ntest of knowledge and ignorance  \\n\\nmost assuredly  \\n\\nand is not the love of learning the love of wisdom   which is\\nphilosophy  \\n\\nthey are the same   he replied  \\n\\nand may we not say confidently of man also   that he who is likely to be\\ngentle to his friends and acquaintances   must by nature be a lover of\\nwisdom and knowledge  \\n\\nthat we may safely affirm  \\n\\nthen he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the state will\\nrequire to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and\\nstrength  \\n\\nundoubtedly  \\n\\nthen we have found the desired natures   and now that we have found\\nthem   how are they to be reared and educated   is not this an enquiry\\nwhich may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is\\nour final end—how do justice and injustice grow up in states   for we do\\nnot want either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the\\nargument to an inconvenient length  \\n\\nadeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us  \\n\\nthen   i said   my dear friend   the task must not be given up   even if\\nsomewhat long  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\ncome then   and let us pass a leisure hour in story  telling   and our\\nstory shall be the education of our heroes  \\n\\nby all means  \\n\\nand what shall be their education   can we find a better than the\\ntraditional sort  —and this has two divisions   gymnastic for the body  \\nand music for the soul  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nshall we begin education with music   and go on to gymnastic afterwards  \\n\\nby all means  \\n\\nand when you speak of music   do you include literature or not  \\n\\ni do  \\n\\nand literature may be either true or false  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand the young should be trained in both kinds   and we begin with the\\nfalse  \\n\\ni do not understand your meaning   he said  \\n\\nyou know   i said   that we begin by telling children stories which  \\nthough not wholly destitute of truth   are in the main fictitious   and\\nthese stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn\\ngymnastics  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nthat was my meaning when i said that we must teach music before\\ngymnastics  \\n\\nquite right   he said  \\n\\nyou know also that the beginning is the most important part of any\\nwork   especially in the case of a young and tender thing   for that is\\nthe time at which the character is being formed and the desired\\nimpression is more readily taken  \\n\\nquite true  \\n\\nand shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales\\nwhich may be devised by casual persons   and to receive into their minds\\nideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish\\nthem to have when they are grown up  \\n\\nwe cannot  \\n\\nthen the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers\\nof fiction   and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is\\ngood   and reject the bad   and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell\\ntheir children the authorised ones only   let them fashion the mind with\\nsuch tales   even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands  \\nbut most of those which are now in use must be discarded  \\n\\nof what tales are you speaking   he said  \\n\\nyou may find a model of the lesser in the greater   i said   for they are\\nnecessarily of the same type   and there is the same spirit in both of\\nthem  \\n\\nvery likely   he replied   but i do not as yet know what you would term\\nthe greater  \\n\\nthose   i said   which are narrated by homer and hesiod   and the rest of\\nthe poets   who have ever been the great story  tellers of mankind  \\n\\nbut which stories do you mean   he said   and what fault do you find with\\nthem  \\n\\na fault which is most serious   i said   the fault of telling a lie   and  \\nwhat is more   a bad lie  \\n\\nbut when is this fault committed  \\n\\nwhenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and\\nheroes  —as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a\\nlikeness to the original  \\n\\nyes   he said   that sort of thing is certainly very blameable   but what\\nare the stories which you mean  \\n\\nfirst of all   i said   there was that greatest of all lies in high\\nplaces   which the poet told about uranus   and which was a bad lie\\ntoo  —i mean what hesiod says that uranus did   and how cronus retaliated\\non him   the doings of cronus   and the sufferings which in turn his son\\ninflicted upon him   even if they were true   ought certainly not to be\\nlightly told to young and thoughtless persons   if possible   they had\\nbetter be buried in silence   but if there is an absolute necessity for\\ntheir mention   a chosen few might hear them in a mystery   and they\\nshould sacrifice not a common   eleusinian   pig   but some huge and\\nunprocurable victim   and then the number of the hearers will be very\\nfew indeed  \\n\\nwhy   yes   said he   those stories are extremely objectionable  \\n\\nyes   adeimantus   they are stories not to be repeated in our state   the\\nyoung man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he\\nis far from doing anything outrageous   and that even if he chastises\\nhis father when he does wrong   in whatever manner   he will only be\\nfollowing the example of the first and greatest among the gods  \\n\\ni entirely agree with you   he said   in my opinion those stories are\\nquite unfit to be repeated  \\n\\nneither   if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of\\nquarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest   should any\\nword be said to them of the wars in heaven   and of the plots and\\nfightings of the gods against one another   for they are not true   no  \\nwe shall never mention the battles of the giants   or let them be\\nembroidered on garments   and we shall be silent about the innumerable\\nother quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and relatives   if\\nthey would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling is\\nunholy   and that never up to this time has there been any quarrel\\nbetween citizens   this is what old men and old women should begin by\\ntelling children   and when they grow up   the poets also should be told\\nto compose for them in a similar spirit   but the narrative of\\nhephaestus binding here his mother   or how on another occasion zeus\\nsent him flying for taking her part when she was being beaten   and all\\nthe battles of the gods in homer—these tales must not be admitted into\\nour state   whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or\\nnot   for a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is\\nliteral   anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely\\nto become indelible and unalterable   and therefore it is most important\\nthat the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous\\nthoughts  \\n\\nthere you are right   he replied   but if any one asks where are such\\nmodels to be found and of what tales are you speaking—how shall we\\nanswer him  \\n\\ni said to him   you and i   adeimantus   at this moment are not poets   but\\nfounders of a state   now the founders of a state ought to know the\\ngeneral forms in which poets should cast their tales   and the limits\\nwhich must be observed by them   but to make the tales is not their\\nbusiness  \\n\\nvery true   he said   but what are these forms of theology which you\\nmean  \\n\\nsomething of this kind   i replied  —god is always to be represented as\\nhe truly is   whatever be the sort of poetry   epic   lyric or tragic   in\\nwhich the representation is given  \\n\\nright  \\n\\nand is he not truly good   and must he not be represented as such  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand no good thing is hurtful  \\n\\nno   indeed  \\n\\nand that which is not hurtful hurts not  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nand that which hurts not does no evil  \\n\\nno  \\n\\nand can that which does no evil be a cause of evil  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nand the good is advantageous  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand therefore the cause of well  being  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nit follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things   but\\nof the good only  \\n\\nassuredly  \\n\\nthen god   if he be good   is not the author of all things   as the many\\nassert   but he is the cause of a few things only   and not of most\\nthings that occur to men   for few are the goods of human life   and many\\nare the evils   and the good is to be attributed to god alone   of the\\nevils the causes are to be sought elsewhere   and not in him  \\n\\nthat appears to me to be most true   he said  \\n\\nthen we must not listen to homer or to any other poet who is guilty of\\nthe folly of saying that two casks\\n\\n  lie at the threshold of zeus   full of lots   one of good   the other of\\nevil lots    \\n\\nand that he to whom zeus gives a mixture of the two\\n\\n  sometimes meets with evil fortune   at other times with good    \\n\\nbut that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill  \\n\\n  him wild hunger drives o  er the beauteous earth    \\n\\nand again—\\n\\n  zeus   who is the dispenser of good and evil to us    \\n\\nand if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties   which\\nwas really the work of pandarus   was brought about by athene and zeus  \\nor that the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by themis\\nand zeus   he shall not have our approval   neither will we allow our\\nyoung men to hear the words of aeschylus   that\\n\\n  god plants guilt among men when he desires utterly to destroy a\\nhouse    \\n\\nand if a poet writes of the sufferings of niobe—the subject of the\\ntragedy in which these iambic verses occur—or of the house of pelops  \\nor of the trojan war or on any similar theme   either we must not permit\\nhim to say that these are the works of god   or if they are of god   he\\nmust devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking   he must\\nsay that god did what was just and right   and they were the better for\\nbeing punished   but that those who are punished are miserable   and that\\ngod is the author of their misery—the poet is not to be permitted to\\nsay   though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they\\nrequire to be punished   and are benefited by receiving punishment from\\ngod   but that god being good is the author of evil to any one is to be\\nstrenuously denied   and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or\\nprose by any one whether old or young in any well  ordered commonwealth  \\nsuch a fiction is suicidal   ruinous   impious  \\n\\ni agree with you   he replied   and am ready to give my assent to the\\nlaw  \\n\\nlet this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods  \\nto which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform  —that god\\nis not the author of all things   but of good only  \\n\\nthat will do   he said  \\n\\nand what do you think of a second principle   shall i ask you whether\\ngod is a magician   and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one\\nshape   and now in another—sometimes himself changing and passing into\\nmany forms   sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such\\ntransformations   or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own\\nproper image  \\n\\ni cannot answer you   he said   without more thought  \\n\\nwell   i said   but if we suppose a change in anything   that change must\\nbe effected either by the thing itself   or by some other thing  \\n\\nmost certainly  \\n\\nand things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered\\nor discomposed   for example   when healthiest and strongest   the human\\nframe is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks   and the plant\\nwhich is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the\\nheat of the sun or any similar causes  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nand will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged\\nby any external influence  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand the same principle   as i should suppose   applies to all composite\\nthings—furniture   houses   garments   when good and well made   they are\\nleast altered by time and circumstances  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nthen everything which is good   whether made by art or nature   or both  \\nis least liable to suffer change from without  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nbut surely god and the things of god are in every way perfect  \\n\\nof course they are  \\n\\nthen he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many\\nshapes  \\n\\nhe cannot  \\n\\nbut may he not change and transform himself  \\n\\nclearly   he said   that must be the case if he is changed at all  \\n\\nand will he then change himself for the better and fairer   or for the\\nworse and more unsightly  \\n\\nif he change at all he can only change for the worse   for we cannot\\nsuppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty  \\n\\nvery true   adeimantus   but then   would any one   whether god or man  \\ndesire to make himself worse  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nthen it is impossible that god should ever be willing to change   being  \\nas is supposed   the fairest and best that is conceivable   every god\\nremains absolutely and for ever in his own form  \\n\\nthat necessarily follows   he said   in my judgment  \\n\\nthen   i said   my dear friend   let none of the poets tell us that\\n\\n  the gods   taking the disguise of strangers from other lands   walk up\\nand down cities in all sorts of forms    \\n\\nand let no one slander proteus and thetis   neither let any one   either\\nin tragedy or in any other kind of poetry   introduce here disguised in\\nthe likeness of a priestess asking an alms\\n\\n  for the life  giving daughters of inachus the river of argos    \\n\\n—let us have no more lies of that sort   neither must we have mothers\\nunder the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad\\nversion of these myths—telling how certain gods   as they say     go about\\nby night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms     but\\nlet them take heed lest they make cowards of their children   and at the\\nsame time speak blasphemy against the gods  \\n\\nheaven forbid   he said  \\n\\nbut although the gods are themselves unchangeable   still by witchcraft\\nand deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms  \\n\\nperhaps   he replied  \\n\\nwell   but can you imagine that god will be willing to lie   whether in\\nword or deed   or to put forth a phantom of himself  \\n\\ni cannot say   he replied  \\n\\ndo you not know   i said   that the true lie   if such an expression may\\nbe allowed   is hated of gods and men  \\n\\nwhat do you mean   he said  \\n\\ni mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest\\nand highest part of himself   or about the truest and highest matters  \\nthere   above all   he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him  \\n\\nstill   he said   i do not comprehend you  \\n\\nthe reason is   i replied   that you attribute some profound meaning to\\nmy words   but i am only saying that deception   or being deceived or\\nuninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of\\nthemselves   which is the soul   and in that part of them to have and to\\nhold the lie   is what mankind least like  —that   i say   is what they\\nutterly detest  \\n\\nthere is nothing more hateful to them  \\n\\nand   as i was just now remarking   this ignorance in the soul of him who\\nis deceived may be called the true lie   for the lie in words is only a\\nkind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the\\nsoul   not pure unadulterated falsehood   am i not right  \\n\\nperfectly right  \\n\\nthe true lie is hated not only by the gods   but also by men  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nwhereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful   in\\ndealing with enemies—that would be an instance   or again   when those\\nwhom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to\\ndo some harm   then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or\\npreventive   also in the tales of mythology   of which we were just now\\nspeaking—because we do not know the truth about ancient times   we make\\nfalsehood as much like truth as we can   and so turn it to account  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nbut can any of these reasons apply to god   can we suppose that he is\\nignorant of antiquity   and therefore has recourse to invention  \\n\\nthat would be ridiculous   he said  \\n\\nthen the lying poet has no place in our idea of god  \\n\\ni should say not  \\n\\nor perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies  \\n\\nthat is inconceivable  \\n\\nbut he may have friends who are senseless or mad  \\n\\nbut no mad or senseless person can be a friend of god  \\n\\nthen no motive can be imagined why god should lie  \\n\\nnone whatever  \\n\\nthen the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthen is god perfectly simple and true both in word and deed   he changes\\nnot   he deceives not   either by sign or word   by dream or waking\\nvision  \\n\\nyour thoughts   he said   are the reflection of my own  \\n\\nyou agree with me then   i said   that this is the second type or form in\\nwhich we should write and speak about divine things   the gods are not\\nmagicians who transform themselves   neither do they deceive mankind in\\nany way  \\n\\ni grant that  \\n\\nthen   although we are admirers of homer   we do not admire the lying\\ndream which zeus sends to agamemnon   neither will we praise the verses\\nof aeschylus in which thetis says that apollo at her nuptials\\n\\n  was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to be long  \\nand to know no sickness   and when he had spoken of my lot as in all\\nthings blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my\\nsoul   and i thought that the word of phoebus   being divine and full of\\nprophecy   would not fail   and now he himself who uttered the strain   he\\nwho was present at the banquet   and who said this—he it is who has\\nslain my son    \\n\\nthese are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our\\nanger   and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus   neither shall\\nwe allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young  \\nmeaning   as we do   that our guardians   as far as men can be   should be\\ntrue worshippers of the gods and like them  \\n\\ni entirely agree   he said   in these principles   and promise to make\\nthem my laws  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book iii  \\n\\n\\nsuch then   i said   are our principles of theology—some tales are to be\\ntold   and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth\\nupwards   if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents   and to\\nvalue friendship with one another  \\n\\nyes   and i think that our principles are right   he said  \\n\\nbut if they are to be courageous   must they not learn other lessons\\nbesides these   and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of\\ndeath   can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him  \\n\\ncertainly not   he said  \\n\\nand can he be fearless of death   or will he choose death in battle\\nrather than defeat and slavery   who believes the world below to be real\\nand terrible  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nthen we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales\\nas well as over the others   and beg them not simply to revile but\\nrather to commend the world below   intimating to them that their\\ndescriptions are untrue   and will do harm to our future warriors  \\n\\nthat will be our duty   he said  \\n\\nthen   i said   we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages  \\nbeginning with the verses  \\n\\n  i would rather be a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man\\nthan rule over all the dead who have come to nought    \\n\\nwe must also expunge the verse   which tells us how pluto feared  \\n\\n  lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should be seen\\nboth of mortals and immortals    \\n\\nand again  —\\n\\n  o heavens   verily in the house of hades there is soul and ghostly form\\nbut no mind at all    \\n\\nagain of tiresias  —\\n\\n    to him even after death did persephone grant mind     that he alone\\nshould be wise   but the other souls are flitting shades    \\n\\nagain  —\\n\\n  the soul flying from the limbs had gone to hades   lamenting her fate  \\nleaving manhood and youth    \\n\\nagain  —\\n\\n  and the soul   with shrilling cry   passed like smoke beneath the\\nearth    \\n\\nand  —\\n\\n  as bats in hollow of mystic cavern   whenever any of them has dropped\\nout of the string and falls from the rock   fly shrilling and cling to\\none another   so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they\\nmoved    \\n\\nand we must beg homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike\\nout these and similar passages   not because they are unpoetical   or\\nunattractive to the popular ear   but because the greater the poetical\\ncharm of them   the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who\\nare meant to be free   and who should fear slavery more than death  \\n\\nundoubtedly  \\n\\nalso we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names which\\ndescribe the world below—cocytus and styx   ghosts under the earth   and\\nsapless shades   and any similar words of which the very mention causes\\na shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them   i do\\nnot say that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind  \\nbut there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered\\ntoo excitable and effeminate by them  \\n\\nthere is a real danger   he said  \\n\\nthen we must have no more of them  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nanother and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nand shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous\\nmen  \\n\\nthey will go with the rest  \\n\\nbut shall we be right in getting rid of them   reflect   our principle is\\nthat the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good\\nman who is his comrade  \\n\\nyes   that is our principle  \\n\\nand therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he\\nhad suffered anything terrible  \\n\\nhe will not  \\n\\nsuch an one   as we further maintain   is sufficient for himself and his\\nown happiness   and therefore is least in need of other men  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nand for this reason the loss of a son or brother   or the deprivation of\\nfortune   is to him of all men least terrible  \\n\\nassuredly  \\n\\nand therefore he will be least likely to lament   and will bear with the\\ngreatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him  \\n\\nyes   he will feel such a misfortune far less than another  \\n\\nthen we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous\\nmen   and making them over to women   and not even to women who are good\\nfor anything     or to men of a baser sort   that those who are being\\neducated by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the\\nlike  \\n\\nthat will be very right  \\n\\nthen we will once more entreat homer and the other poets not to depict\\nachilles   who is the son of a goddess   first lying on his side   then on\\nhis back   and then on his face   then starting up and sailing in a\\nfrenzy along the shores of the barren sea   now taking the sooty ashes\\nin both his hands and pouring them over his head   or weeping and\\nwailing in the various modes which homer has delineated   nor should he\\ndescribe priam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching  \\n\\n  rolling in the dirt   calling each man loudly by his name    \\n\\nstill more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce\\nthe gods lamenting and saying  \\n\\n  alas   my misery   alas   that i bore the bravest to my sorrow    \\n\\nbut if he must introduce the gods   at any rate let him not dare so\\ncompletely to misrepresent the greatest of the gods   as to make him\\nsay—\\n\\n  o heavens   with my eyes verily i behold a dear friend of mine chased\\nround and round the city   and my heart is sorrowful    \\n\\nor again  —\\n\\nwoe is me that i am fated to have sarpedon   dearest of men to me  \\nsubdued at the hands of patroclus the son of menoetius    \\n\\nfor if   my sweet adeimantus   our youth seriously listen to such\\nunworthy representations of the gods   instead of laughing at them as\\nthey ought   hardly will any of them deem that he himself   being but a\\nman   can be dishonoured by similar actions   neither will he rebuke any\\ninclination which may arise in his mind to say and do the like   and\\ninstead of having any shame or self  control   he will be always whining\\nand lamenting on slight occasions  \\n\\nyes   he said   that is most true  \\n\\nyes   i replied   but that surely is what ought not to be   as the\\nargument has just proved to us   and by that proof we must abide until\\nit is disproved by a better  \\n\\nit ought not to be  \\n\\nneither ought our guardians to be given to laughter   for a fit of\\nlaughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a\\nviolent reaction  \\n\\nso i believe  \\n\\nthen persons of worth   even if only mortal men   must not be represented\\nas overcome by laughter   and still less must such a representation of\\nthe gods be allowed  \\n\\nstill less of the gods   as you say   he replied  \\n\\nthen we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods\\nas that of homer when he describes how\\n\\n  inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods   when they saw\\nhephaestus bustling about the mansion    \\n\\non your views   we must not admit them  \\n\\non my views   if you like to father them on me   that we must not admit\\nthem is certain  \\n\\nagain   truth should be highly valued   if   as we were saying   a lie is\\nuseless to the gods   and useful only as a medicine to men   then the use\\nof such medicines should be restricted to physicians   private\\nindividuals have no business with them  \\n\\nclearly not   he said  \\n\\nthen if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying   the rulers of\\nthe state should be the persons   and they   in their dealings either\\nwith enemies or with their own citizens   may be allowed to lie for the\\npublic good   but nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind  \\nand although the rulers have this privilege   for a private man to lie\\nto them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the\\npatient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his\\nown bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer   or for a\\nsailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the ship and the\\nrest of the crew   and how things are going with himself or his fellow\\nsailors  \\n\\nmost true   he said  \\n\\nif   then   the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the state  \\n\\n  any of the craftsmen   whether he be priest or physician or carpenter    \\n\\nhe will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally\\nsubversive and destructive of ship or state  \\n\\nmost certainly   he said   if our idea of the state is ever carried out  \\n\\nin the next place our youth must be temperate  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nare not the chief elements of temperance   speaking generally   obedience\\nto commanders and self  control in sensual pleasures  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthen we shall approve such language as that of diomede in homer  \\n\\n  friend   sit still and obey my word    \\n\\nand the verses which follow  \\n\\n  the greeks marched breathing prowess         in silent awe of their\\nleaders    \\n\\nand other sentiments of the same kind  \\n\\nwe shall  \\n\\nwhat of this line  \\n\\n  o heavy with wine   who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a\\nstag    \\n\\nand of the words which follow   would you say that these   or any similar\\nimpertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to\\ntheir rulers   whether in verse or prose   are well or ill spoken  \\n\\nthey are ill spoken  \\n\\nthey may very possibly afford some amusement   but they do not conduce\\nto temperance   and therefore they are likely to do harm to our young\\nmen—you would agree with me there  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand then   again   to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his\\nopinion is more glorious than\\n\\n  when the tables are full of bread and meat   and the cup  bearer carries\\nround wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups    \\n\\nis it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such\\nwords   or the verse\\n\\n  the saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger    \\n\\nwhat would you say again to the tale of zeus   who   while other gods and\\nmen were asleep and he the only person awake   lay devising plans   but\\nforgot them all in a moment through his lust   and was so completely\\novercome at the sight of here that he would not even go into the hut  \\nbut wanted to lie with her on the ground   declaring that he had never\\nbeen in such a state of rapture before   even when they first met one\\nanother\\n\\n  without the knowledge of their parents    \\n\\nor that other tale of how hephaestus   because of similar goings on  \\ncast a chain around ares and aphrodite  \\n\\nindeed   he said   i am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear\\nthat sort of thing  \\n\\nbut any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men   these\\nthey ought to see and hear   as   for example   what is said in the\\nverses  \\n\\n  he smote his breast   and thus reproached his heart   endure   my heart  \\nfar worse hast thou endured    \\n\\ncertainly   he said  \\n\\nin the next place   we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers\\nof money  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nneither must we sing to them of\\n\\n  gifts persuading gods   and persuading reverend kings    \\n\\nneither is phoenix   the tutor of achilles   to be approved or deemed to\\nhave given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take\\nthe gifts of the greeks and assist them   but that without a gift he\\nshould not lay aside his anger   neither will we believe or acknowledge\\nachilles himself to have been such a lover of money that he took\\nagamemnon  s gifts   or that when he had received payment he restored the\\ndead body of hector   but that without payment he was unwilling to do\\nso  \\n\\nundoubtedly   he said   these are not sentiments which can be approved  \\n\\nloving homer as i do   i hardly like to say that in attributing these\\nfeelings to achilles   or in believing that they are truly attributed to\\nhim   he is guilty of downright impiety   as little can i believe the\\nnarrative of his insolence to apollo   where he says  \\n\\n  thou hast wronged me   o far  darter   most abominable of deities   verily\\ni would be even with thee   if i had only the power    \\n\\nor his insubordination to the river  god   on whose divinity he is ready\\nto lay hands   or his offering to the dead patroclus of his own hair  \\nwhich had been previously dedicated to the other river  god spercheius  \\nand that he actually performed this vow   or that he dragged hector\\nround the tomb of patroclus   and slaughtered the captives at the pyre  \\nof all this i cannot believe that he was guilty   any more than i can\\nallow our citizens to believe that he   the wise cheiron  s pupil   the\\nson of a goddess and of peleus who was the gentlest of men and third in\\ndescent from zeus   was so disordered in his wits as to be at one time\\nthe slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions   meanness   not\\nuntainted by avarice   combined with overweening contempt of gods and\\nmen  \\n\\nyou are quite right   he replied  \\n\\nand let us equally refuse to believe   or allow to be repeated   the tale\\nof theseus son of poseidon   or of peirithous son of zeus   going forth\\nas they did to perpetrate a horrid rape   or of any other hero or son of\\na god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely\\nascribe to them in our day   and let us further compel the poets to\\ndeclare either that these acts were not done by them   or that they were\\nnot the sons of gods  —both in the same breath they shall not be\\npermitted to affirm   we will not have them trying to persuade our youth\\nthat the gods are the authors of evil   and that heroes are no better\\nthan men—sentiments which   as we were saying   are neither pious nor\\ntrue   for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the gods  \\n\\nassuredly not  \\n\\nand further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear\\nthem   for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is\\nconvinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by—\\n\\n  the kindred of the gods   the relatives of zeus   whose ancestral altar  \\nthe altar of zeus   is aloft in air on the peak of ida    \\n\\nand who have\\n\\n  the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins    \\n\\nand therefore let us put an end to such tales   lest they engender\\nlaxity of morals among the young  \\n\\nby all means   he replied  \\n\\nbut now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not\\nto be spoken of   let us see whether any have been omitted by us   the\\nmanner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should\\nbe treated has been already laid down  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand what shall we say about men   that is clearly the remaining portion\\nof our subject  \\n\\nclearly so  \\n\\nbut we are not in a condition to answer this question at present   my\\nfriend  \\n\\nwhy not  \\n\\nbecause   if i am not mistaken   we shall have to say that about men\\npoets and story  tellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements\\nwhen they tell us that wicked men are often happy   and the good\\nmiserable   and that injustice is profitable when undetected   but that\\njustice is a man  s own loss and another  s gain—these things we shall\\nforbid them to utter   and command them to sing and say the opposite  \\n\\nto be sure we shall   he replied  \\n\\nbut if you admit that i am right in this   then i shall maintain that\\nyou have implied the principle for which we have been all along\\ncontending  \\n\\ni grant the truth of your inference  \\n\\nthat such things are or are not to be said about men is a question\\nwhich we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is   and\\nhow naturally advantageous to the possessor   whether he seem to be just\\nor not  \\n\\nmost true   he said  \\n\\nenough of the subjects of poetry   let us now speak of the style   and\\nwhen this has been considered   both matter and manner will have been\\ncompletely treated  \\n\\ni do not understand what you mean   said adeimantus  \\n\\nthen i must make you understand   and perhaps i may be more intelligible\\nif i put the matter in this way   you are aware   i suppose   that all\\nmythology and poetry is a narration of events   either past   present   or\\nto come  \\n\\ncertainly   he replied  \\n\\nand narration may be either simple narration   or imitation   or a union\\nof the two  \\n\\nthat again   he said   i do not quite understand  \\n\\ni fear that i must be a ridiculous teacher when i have so much\\ndifficulty in making myself apprehended   like a bad speaker   therefore  \\ni will not take the whole of the subject   but will break a piece off in\\nillustration of my meaning   you know the first lines of the iliad   in\\nwhich the poet says that chryses prayed agamemnon to release his\\ndaughter   and that agamemnon flew into a passion with him   whereupon\\nchryses   failing of his object   invoked the anger of the god against\\nthe achaeans   now as far as these lines  \\n\\n  and he prayed all the greeks   but especially the two sons of atreus  \\nthe chiefs of the people    \\n\\nthe poet is speaking in his own person   he never leads us to suppose\\nthat he is any one else   but in what follows he takes the person of\\nchryses   and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the\\nspeaker is not homer   but the aged priest himself   and in this double\\nform he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at\\ntroy and in ithaca and throughout the odyssey  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites\\nfrom time to time and in the intermediate passages  \\n\\nquite true  \\n\\nbut when the poet speaks in the person of another   may we not say that\\nhe assimilates his style to that of the person who   as he informs you  \\nis going to speak  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand this assimilation of himself to another   either by the use of voice\\nor gesture   is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nthen in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by\\nway of imitation  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nor   if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself   then\\nagain the imitation is dropped   and his poetry becomes simple\\nnarration   however   in order that i may make my meaning quite clear  \\nand that you may no more say     i don  t understand     i will show how the\\nchange might be effected   if homer had said     the priest came   having\\nhis daughter  s ransom in his hands   supplicating the achaeans   and\\nabove all the kings     and then if   instead of speaking in the person of\\nchryses   he had continued in his own person   the words would have been  \\nnot imitation   but simple narration   the passage would have run as\\nfollows   i am no poet   and therefore i drop the metre       the priest\\ncame and prayed the gods on behalf of the greeks that they might\\ncapture troy and return safely home   but begged that they would give\\nhim back his daughter   and take the ransom which he brought   and\\nrespect the god   thus he spoke   and the other greeks revered the priest\\nand assented   but agamemnon was wroth   and bade him depart and not come\\nagain   lest the staff and chaplets of the god should be of no avail to\\nhim—the daughter of chryses should not be released   he said—she should\\ngrow old with him in argos   and then he told him to go away and not to\\nprovoke him   if he intended to get home unscathed   and the old man went\\naway in fear and silence   and   when he had left the camp   he called\\nupon apollo by his many names   reminding him of everything which he had\\ndone pleasing to him   whether in building his temples   or in offering\\nsacrifice   and praying that his good deeds might be returned to him  \\nand that the achaeans might expiate his tears by the arrows of the\\ngod    —and so on   in this way the whole becomes simple narrative  \\n\\ni understand   he said  \\n\\nor you may suppose the opposite case—that the intermediate passages are\\nomitted   and the dialogue only left  \\n\\nthat also   he said   i understand   you mean   for example   as in tragedy  \\n\\nyou have conceived my meaning perfectly   and if i mistake not   what you\\nfailed to apprehend before is now made clear to you   that poetry and\\nmythology are   in some cases   wholly imitative—instances of this are\\nsupplied by tragedy and comedy   there is likewise the opposite style  \\nin which the poet is the only speaker—of this the dithyramb affords the\\nbest example   and the combination of both is found in epic   and in\\nseveral other styles of poetry   do i take you with me  \\n\\nyes   he said   i see now what you meant  \\n\\ni will ask you to remember also what i began by saying   that we had\\ndone with the subject and might proceed to the style  \\n\\nyes   i remember  \\n\\nin saying this   i intended to imply that we must come to an\\nunderstanding about the mimetic art  —whether the poets   in narrating\\ntheir stories   are to be allowed by us to imitate   and if so   whether\\nin whole or in part   and if the latter   in what parts   or should all\\nimitation be prohibited  \\n\\nyou mean   i suspect   to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be\\nadmitted into our state  \\n\\nyes   i said   but there may be more than this in question   i really do\\nnot know as yet   but whither the argument may blow   thither we go  \\n\\nand go we will   he said  \\n\\nthen   adeimantus   let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be\\nimitators   or rather   has not this question been decided by the rule\\nalready laid down that one man can only do one thing well   and not\\nmany   and that if he attempt many   he will altogether fail of gaining\\nmuch reputation in any  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand this is equally true of imitation   no one man can imitate many\\nthings as well as he would imitate a single one  \\n\\nhe cannot  \\n\\nthen the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in\\nlife   and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other\\nparts as well   for even when two species of imitation are nearly\\nallied   the same persons cannot succeed in both   as   for example   the\\nwriters of tragedy and comedy—did you not just now call them\\nimitations  \\n\\nyes   i did   and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot\\nsucceed in both  \\n\\nany more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nneither are comic and tragic actors the same   yet all these things are\\nbut imitations  \\n\\nthey are so  \\n\\nand human nature   adeimantus   appears to have been coined into yet\\nsmaller pieces   and to be as incapable of imitating many things well  \\nas of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies  \\n\\nquite true   he replied  \\n\\nif then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our\\nguardians   setting aside every other business   are to dedicate\\nthemselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the state   making\\nthis their craft   and engaging in no work which does not bear on this\\nend   they ought not to practise or imitate anything else   if they\\nimitate at all   they should imitate from youth upward only those\\ncharacters which are suitable to their profession—the courageous  \\ntemperate   holy   free   and the like   but they should not depict or be\\nskilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness   lest from\\nimitation they should come to be what they imitate   did you never\\nobserve how imitations   beginning in early youth and continuing far\\ninto life   at length grow into habits and become a second nature  \\naffecting body   voice   and mind  \\n\\nyes   certainly   he said  \\n\\nthen   i said   we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of\\nwhom we say that they ought to be good men   to imitate a woman   whether\\nyoung or old   quarrelling with her husband   or striving and vaunting\\nagainst the gods in conceit of her happiness   or when she is in\\naffliction   or sorrow   or weeping   and certainly not one who is in\\nsickness   love   or labour  \\n\\nvery right   he said  \\n\\nneither must they represent slaves   male or female   performing the\\noffices of slaves  \\n\\nthey must not  \\n\\nand surely not bad men   whether cowards or any others   who do the\\nreverse of what we have just been prescribing   who scold or mock or\\nrevile one another in drink or out of drink   or who in any other manner\\nsin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed   as the\\nmanner of such is   neither should they be trained to imitate the action\\nor speech of men or women who are mad or bad   for madness   like vice  \\nis to be known but not to be practised or imitated  \\n\\nvery true   he replied  \\n\\nneither may they imitate smiths or other artificers   or oarsmen   or\\nboatswains   or the like  \\n\\nhow can they   he said   when they are not allowed to apply their minds\\nto the callings of any of these  \\n\\nnor may they imitate the neighing of horses   the bellowing of bulls  \\nthe murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean   thunder   and all that sort\\nof thing  \\n\\nnay   he said   if madness be forbidden   neither may they copy the\\nbehaviour of madmen  \\n\\nyou mean   i said   if i understand you aright   that there is one sort of\\nnarrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has\\nanything to say   and that another sort will be used by a man of an\\nopposite character and education  \\n\\nand which are these two sorts   he asked  \\n\\nsuppose   i answered   that a just and good man in the course of a\\nnarration comes on some saying or action of another good man  —i should\\nimagine that he will like to personate him   and will not be ashamed of\\nthis sort of imitation   he will be most ready to play the part of the\\ngood man when he is acting firmly and wisely   in a less degree when he\\nis overtaken by illness or love or drink   or has met with any other\\ndisaster   but when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him   he\\nwill not make a study of that   he will disdain such a person   and will\\nassume his likeness   if at all   for a moment only when he is performing\\nsome good action   at other times he will be ashamed to play a part\\nwhich he has never practised   nor will he like to fashion and frame\\nhimself after the baser models   he feels the employment of such an art  \\nunless in jest   to be beneath him   and his mind revolts at it  \\n\\nso i should expect   he replied  \\n\\nthen he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated out\\nof homer   that is to say   his style will be both imitative and\\nnarrative   but there will be very little of the former   and a great\\ndeal of the latter   do you agree  \\n\\ncertainly   he said   that is the model which such a speaker must\\nnecessarily take  \\n\\nbut there is another sort of character who will narrate anything   and  \\nthe worse he is   the more unscrupulous he will be   nothing will be too\\nbad for him   and he will be ready to imitate anything   not as a joke  \\nbut in right good earnest   and before a large company   as i was just\\nnow saying   he will attempt to represent the roll of thunder   the noise\\nof wind and hail   or the creaking of wheels   and pulleys   and the\\nvarious sounds of flutes   pipes   trumpets   and all sorts of\\ninstruments   he will bark like a dog   bleat like a sheep   or crow like\\na cock   his entire art will consist in imitation of voice and gesture  \\nand there will be very little narration  \\n\\nthat   he said   will be his mode of speaking  \\n\\nthese   then   are the two kinds of style  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and\\nhas but slight changes   and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen\\nfor their simplicity   the result is that the speaker   if he speaks\\ncorrectly   is always pretty much the same in style   and he will keep\\nwithin the limits of a single harmony   for the changes are not great    \\nand in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm  \\n\\nthat is quite true   he said  \\n\\nwhereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of\\nrhythms   if the music and the style are to correspond   because the\\nstyle has all sorts of changes  \\n\\nthat is also perfectly true   he replied  \\n\\nand do not the two styles   or the mixture of the two   comprehend all\\npoetry   and every form of expression in words   no one can say anything\\nexcept in one or other of them or in both together  \\n\\nthey include all   he said  \\n\\nand shall we receive into our state all the three styles   or one only\\nof the two unmixed styles   or would you include the mixed  \\n\\ni should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue  \\n\\nyes   i said   adeimantus   but the mixed style is also very charming   and\\nindeed the pantomimic   which is the opposite of the one chosen by you  \\nis the most popular style with children and their attendants   and with\\nthe world in general  \\n\\ni do not deny it  \\n\\nbut i suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our\\nstate   in which human nature is not twofold or manifold   for one man\\nplays one part only  \\n\\nyes   quite unsuitable  \\n\\nand this is the reason why in our state   and in our state only   we\\nshall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also   and a\\nhusbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also   and a soldier a\\nsoldier and not a trader also   and the same throughout  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nand therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen   who are so\\nclever that they can imitate anything   comes to us   and makes a\\nproposal to exhibit himself and his poetry   we will fall down and\\nworship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being   but we must also\\ninform him that in our state such as he are not permitted to exist   the\\nlaw will not allow them   and so when we have anointed him with myrrh  \\nand set a garland of wool upon his head   we shall send him away to\\nanother city   for we mean to employ for our souls   health the rougher\\nand severer poet or story  teller   who will imitate the style of the\\nvirtuous only   and will follow those models which we prescribed at\\nfirst when we began the education of our soldiers  \\n\\nwe certainly will   he said   if we have the power  \\n\\nthen now   my friend   i said   that part of music or literary education\\nwhich relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished  \\nfor the matter and manner have both been discussed  \\n\\ni think so too   he said  \\n\\nnext in order will follow melody and song  \\n\\nthat is obvious  \\n\\nevery one can see already what we ought to say about them   if we are to\\nbe consistent with ourselves  \\n\\ni fear   said glaucon   laughing   that the word   every one   hardly\\nincludes me   for i cannot at the moment say what they should be   though\\ni may guess  \\n\\nat any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts—the words  \\nthe melody   and the rhythm   that degree of knowledge i may presuppose  \\n\\nyes   he said   so much as that you may  \\n\\nand as for the words   there will surely be no difference between words\\nwhich are and which are not set to music   both will conform to the same\\nlaws   and these have been already determined by us  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nwe were saying   when we spoke of the subject  matter   that we had no\\nneed of lamentation and strains of sorrow  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow   you are musical   and\\ncan tell me  \\n\\nthe harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor lydian   and the\\nfull  toned or bass lydian   and such like  \\n\\nthese then   i said   must be banished   even to women who have a\\ncharacter to maintain they are of no use   and much less to men  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nin the next place   drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly\\nunbecoming the character of our guardians  \\n\\nutterly unbecoming  \\n\\nand which are the soft or drinking harmonies  \\n\\nthe ionian   he replied   and the lydian   they are termed   relaxed    \\n\\nwell   and are these of any military use  \\n\\nquite the reverse   he replied   and if so the dorian and the phrygian\\nare the only ones which you have left  \\n\\ni answered   of the harmonies i know nothing   but i want to have one\\nwarlike   to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the\\nhour of danger and stern resolve   or when his cause is failing   and he\\nis going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil   and at\\nevery such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a\\ndetermination to endure   and another to be used by him in times of\\npeace and freedom of action   when there is no pressure of necessity  \\nand he is seeking to persuade god by prayer   or man by instruction and\\nadmonition   or on the other hand   when he is expressing his willingness\\nto yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition   and which represents\\nhim when by prudent conduct he has attained his end   not carried away\\nby his success   but acting moderately and wisely under the\\ncircumstances   and acquiescing in the event   these two harmonies i ask\\nyou to leave   the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom   the\\nstrain of the unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate   the strain\\nof courage   and the strain of temperance   these   i say   leave  \\n\\nand these   he replied   are the dorian and phrygian harmonies of which i\\nwas just now speaking  \\n\\nthen   i said   if these and these only are to be used in our songs and\\nmelodies   we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic\\nscale  \\n\\ni suppose not  \\n\\nthen we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners\\nand complex scales   or the makers of any other many  stringed\\ncuriously  harmonised instruments  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nbut what do you say to flute  makers and flute  players   would you admit\\nthem into our state when you reflect that in this composite use of\\nharmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put\\ntogether   even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute  \\n\\nclearly not  \\n\\nthere remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city   and\\nthe shepherds may have a pipe in the country  \\n\\nthat is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument  \\n\\nthe preferring of apollo and his instruments to marsyas and his\\ninstruments is not at all strange   i said  \\n\\nnot at all   he replied  \\n\\nand so   by the dog of egypt   we have been unconsciously purging the\\nstate   which not long ago we termed luxurious  \\n\\nand we have done wisely   he replied  \\n\\nthen let us now finish the purgation   i said   next in order to\\nharmonies   rhythms will naturally follow   and they should be subject to\\nthe same rules   for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre  \\nor metres of every kind   but rather to discover what rhythms are the\\nexpressions of a courageous and harmonious life   and when we have found\\nthem   we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like\\nspirit   not the words to the foot and melody   to say what these rhythms\\nare will be your duty—you must teach me them   as you have already\\ntaught me the harmonies  \\n\\nbut   indeed   he replied   i cannot tell you   i only know that there are\\nsome three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are\\nframed   just as in sounds there are four notes   i  e   the four notes of\\nthe tetrachord     out of which all the harmonies are composed   that is\\nan observation which i have made   but of what sort of lives they are\\nseverally the imitations i am unable to say  \\n\\nthen   i said   we must take damon into our counsels   and he will tell us\\nwhat rhythms are expressive of meanness   or insolence   or fury   or\\nother unworthiness   and what are to be reserved for the expression of\\nopposite feelings   and i think that i have an indistinct recollection\\nof his mentioning a complex cretic rhythm   also a dactylic or heroic  \\nand he arranged them in some manner which i do not quite understand  \\nmaking the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot   long and\\nshort alternating   and   unless i am mistaken   he spoke of an iambic as\\nwell as of a trochaic rhythm   and assigned to them short and long\\nquantities   also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the\\nmovement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm   or perhaps a\\ncombination of the two   for i am not certain what he meant   these\\nmatters   however   as i was saying   had better be referred to damon\\nhimself   for the analysis of the subject would be difficult   you know  \\n  socrates expresses himself carelessly in accordance with his assumed\\nignorance of the details of the subject   in the first part of the\\nsentence he appears to be speaking of paeonic rhythms which are in the\\nratio of 3  2   in the second part   of dactylic and anapaestic rhythms  \\nwhich are in the ratio of 1  1   in the last clause   of iambic and\\ntrochaic rhythms   which are in the ratio of 1  2 or 2  1    \\n\\nrather so   i should say  \\n\\nbut there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace\\nis an effect of good or bad rhythm  \\n\\nnone at all  \\n\\nand also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and\\nbad style   and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style  \\nfor our principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the\\nwords   and not the words by them  \\n\\njust so   he said   they should follow the words  \\n\\nand will not the words and the character of the style depend on the\\ntemper of the soul  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand everything else on the style  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthen beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on\\nsimplicity  —i mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered\\nmind and character   not that other simplicity which is only an\\neuphemism for folly  \\n\\nvery true   he replied  \\n\\nand if our youth are to do their work in life   must they not make these\\ngraces and harmonies their perpetual aim  \\n\\nthey must  \\n\\nand surely the art of the painter and every other creative and\\nconstructive art are full of them  —weaving   embroidery   architecture  \\nand every kind of manufacture   also nature   animal and vegetable  —in\\nall of them there is grace or the absence of grace   and ugliness and\\ndiscord and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill\\nnature   as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and\\nvirtue and bear their likeness  \\n\\nthat is quite true   he said  \\n\\nbut shall our superintendence go no further   and are the poets only to\\nbe required by us to express the image of the good in their works   on\\npain   if they do anything else   of expulsion from our state   or is the\\nsame control to be extended to other artists   and are they also to be\\nprohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance\\nand meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other\\ncreative arts   and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be\\nprevented from practising his art in our state   lest the taste of our\\ncitizens be corrupted by him   we would not have our guardians grow up\\namid images of moral deformity   as in some noxious pasture   and there\\nbrowse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day   little\\nby little   until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in\\ntheir own soul   let our artists rather be those who are gifted to\\ndiscern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful   then will our\\nyouth dwell in a land of health   amid fair sights and sounds   and\\nreceive the good in everything   and beauty   the effluence of fair\\nworks   shall flow into the eye and ear   like a health  giving breeze\\nfrom a purer region   and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years\\ninto likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason  \\n\\nthere can be no nobler training than that   he replied  \\n\\nand therefore   i said   glaucon   musical training is a more potent\\ninstrument than any other   because rhythm and harmony find their way\\ninto the inward places of the soul   on which they mightily fasten  \\nimparting grace   and making the soul of him who is rightly educated\\ngraceful   or of him who is ill  educated ungraceful   and also because he\\nwho has received this true education of the inner being will most\\nshrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature   and with a\\ntrue taste   while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his\\nsoul the good   and becomes noble and good   he will justly blame and\\nhate the bad   now in the days of his youth   even before he is able to\\nknow the reason why   and when reason comes he will recognise and salute\\nthe friend with whom his education has made him long familiar  \\n\\nyes   he said   i quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should\\nbe trained in music and on the grounds which you mention  \\n\\njust as in learning to read   i said   we were satisfied when we knew the\\nletters of the alphabet   which are very few   in all their recurring\\nsizes and combinations   not slighting them as unimportant whether they\\noccupy a space large or small   but everywhere eager to make them out  \\nand not thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we\\nrecognise them wherever they are found  \\n\\ntrue—\\n\\nor   as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water   or in a\\nmirror   only when we know the letters themselves   the same art and\\nstudy giving us the knowledge of both  \\n\\nexactly—\\n\\neven so   as i maintain   neither we nor our guardians   whom we have to\\neducate   can ever become musical until we and they know the essential\\nforms of temperance   courage   liberality   magnificence   and their\\nkindred   as well as the contrary forms   in all their combinations   and\\ncan recognise them and their images wherever they are found   not\\nslighting them either in small things or great   but believing them all\\nto be within the sphere of one art and study  \\n\\nmost assuredly  \\n\\nand when a beautiful soul harmonizes with a beautiful form   and the two\\nare cast in one mould   that will be the fairest of sights to him who\\nhas an eye to see it  \\n\\nthe fairest indeed  \\n\\nand the fairest is also the loveliest  \\n\\nthat may be assumed  \\n\\nand the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the\\nloveliest   but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul  \\n\\nthat is true   he replied   if the deficiency be in his soul   but if\\nthere be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it  \\nand will love all the same  \\n\\ni perceive   i said   that you have or have had experiences of this sort  \\nand i agree   but let me ask you another question   has excess of\\npleasure any affinity to temperance  \\n\\nhow can that be   he replied   pleasure deprives a man of the use of his\\nfaculties quite as much as pain  \\n\\nor any affinity to virtue in general  \\n\\nnone whatever  \\n\\nany affinity to wantonness and intemperance  \\n\\nyes   the greatest  \\n\\nand is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love  \\n\\nno   nor a madder  \\n\\nwhereas true love is a love of beauty and order—temperate and\\nharmonious  \\n\\nquite true   he said  \\n\\nthen no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true\\nlove  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nthen mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the\\nlover and his beloved   neither of them can have any part in it if their\\nlove is of the right sort  \\n\\nno   indeed   socrates   it must never come near them  \\n\\nthen i suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a\\nlaw to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his\\nlove than a father would use to his son   and then only for a noble\\npurpose   and he must first have the other  s consent   and this rule is\\nto limit him in all his intercourse   and he is never to be seen going\\nfurther   or   if he exceeds   he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and\\nbad taste  \\n\\ni quite agree   he said  \\n\\nthus much of music   which makes a fair ending   for what should be the\\nend of music if not the love of beauty  \\n\\ni agree   he said  \\n\\nafter music comes gymnastic   in which our youth are next to be trained  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\ngymnastic as well as music should begin in early years   the training in\\nit should be careful and should continue through life   now my belief\\nis  —and this is a matter upon which i should like to have your opinion\\nin confirmation of my own   but my own belief is  —not that the good body\\nby any bodily excellence improves the soul   but   on the contrary   that\\nthe good soul   by her own excellence   improves the body as far as this\\nmay be possible   what do you say  \\n\\nyes   i agree  \\n\\nthen   to the mind when adequately trained   we shall be right in handing\\nover the more particular care of the body   and in order to avoid\\nprolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject  \\n\\nvery good  \\n\\nthat they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by\\nus   for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and\\nnot know where in the world he is  \\n\\nyes   he said   that a guardian should require another guardian to take\\ncare of him is ridiculous indeed  \\n\\nbut next   what shall we say of their food   for the men are in training\\nfor the great contest of all—are they not  \\n\\nyes   he said  \\n\\nand will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them  \\n\\nwhy not  \\n\\ni am afraid   i said   that a habit of body such as they have is but a\\nsleepy sort of thing   and rather perilous to health   do you not observe\\nthat these athletes sleep away their lives   and are liable to most\\ndangerous illnesses if they depart   in ever so slight a degree   from\\ntheir customary regimen  \\n\\nyes   i do  \\n\\nthen   i said   a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior\\nathletes   who are to be like wakeful dogs   and to see and hear with the\\nutmost keenness   amid the many changes of water and also of food   of\\nsummer heat and winter cold   which they will have to endure when on a\\ncampaign   they must not be liable to break down in health  \\n\\nthat is my view  \\n\\nthe really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music\\nwhich we were just now describing  \\n\\nhow so  \\n\\nwhy   i conceive that there is a gymnastic which   like our music   is\\nsimple and good   and especially the military gymnastic  \\n\\nwhat do you mean  \\n\\nmy meaning may be learned from homer   he   you know   feeds his heroes at\\ntheir feasts   when they are campaigning   on soldiers   fare   they have\\nno fish   although they are on the shores of the hellespont   and they\\nare not allowed boiled meats but only roast   which is the food most\\nconvenient for soldiers   requiring only that they should light a fire  \\nand not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand i can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere\\nmentioned in homer   in proscribing them   however   he is not singular  \\nall professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in\\ngood condition should take nothing of the kind  \\n\\nyes   he said   and knowing this   they are quite right in not taking\\nthem  \\n\\nthen you would not approve of syracusan dinners   and the refinements of\\nsicilian cookery  \\n\\ni think not  \\n\\nnor   if a man is to be in condition   would you allow him to have a\\ncorinthian girl as his fair friend  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nneither would you approve of the delicacies   as they are thought   of\\nathenian confectionary  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nall such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody and\\nsong composed in the panharmonic style   and in all the rhythms  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nthere complexity engendered licence   and here disease   whereas\\nsimplicity in music was the parent of temperance in the soul   and\\nsimplicity in gymnastic of health in the body  \\n\\nmost true   he said  \\n\\nbut when intemperance and diseases multiply in a state   halls of\\njustice and medicine are always being opened   and the arts of the\\ndoctor and the lawyer give themselves airs   finding how keen is the\\ninterest which not only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about\\nthem  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nand yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state\\nof education than this   that not only artisans and the meaner sort of\\npeople need the skill of first  rate physicians and judges   but also\\nthose who would profess to have had a liberal education   is it not\\ndisgraceful   and a great sign of want of good  breeding   that a man\\nshould have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of\\nhis own at home   and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of\\nother men whom he makes lords and judges over him  \\n\\nof all things   he said   the most disgraceful  \\n\\nwould you say   most     i replied   when you consider that there is a\\nfurther stage of the evil in which a man is not only a life  long\\nlitigant   passing all his days in the courts   either as plaintiff or\\ndefendant   but is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his\\nlitigiousness   he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty   able to\\ntake every crooked turn   and wriggle into and out of every hole  \\nbending like a withy and getting out of the way of justice   and all for\\nwhat  —in order to gain small points not worth mentioning   he not\\nknowing that so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping\\njudge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing   is not that still more\\ndisgraceful  \\n\\nyes   he said   that is still more disgraceful  \\n\\nwell   i said   and to require the help of medicine   not when a wound has\\nto be cured   or on occasion of an epidemic   but just because   by\\nindolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing   men fill\\nthemselves with waters and winds   as if their bodies were a marsh  \\ncompelling the ingenious sons of asclepius to find more names for\\ndiseases   such as flatulence and catarrh   is not this   too   a disgrace  \\n\\nyes   he said   they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names\\nto diseases  \\n\\nyes   i said   and i do not believe that there were any such diseases in\\nthe days of asclepius   and this i infer from the circumstance that the\\nhero eurypylus   after he has been wounded in homer   drinks a posset of\\npramnian wine well besprinkled with barley  meal and grated cheese  \\nwhich are certainly inflammatory   and yet the sons of asclepius who\\nwere at the trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink  \\nor rebuke patroclus   who is treating his case  \\n\\nwell   he said   that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a\\nperson in his condition  \\n\\nnot so extraordinary   i replied   if you bear in mind that in former\\ndays   as is commonly said   before the time of herodicus   the guild of\\nasclepius did not practise our present system of medicine   which may be\\nsaid to educate diseases   but herodicus   being a trainer   and himself\\nof a sickly constitution   by a combination of training and doctoring\\nfound out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself   and secondly\\nthe rest of the world  \\n\\nhow was that   he said  \\n\\nby the invention of lingering death   for he had a mortal disease which\\nhe perpetually tended   and as recovery was out of the question   he\\npassed his entire life as a valetudinarian   he could do nothing but\\nattend upon himself   and he was in constant torment whenever he\\ndeparted in anything from his usual regimen   and so dying hard   by the\\nhelp of science he struggled on to old age  \\n\\na rare reward of his skill  \\n\\nyes   i said   a reward which a man might fairly expect who never\\nunderstood that   if asclepius did not instruct his descendants in\\nvaletudinarian arts   the omission arose   not from ignorance or\\ninexperience of such a branch of medicine   but because he knew that in\\nall well  ordered states every individual has an occupation to which he\\nmust attend   and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being\\nill   this we remark in the case of the artisan   but   ludicrously\\nenough   do not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort  \\n\\nhow do you mean   he said  \\n\\ni mean this   when a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough\\nand ready cure   an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife  —these\\nare his remedies   and if some one prescribes for him a course of\\ndietetics   and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head   and\\nall that sort of thing   he replies at once that he has no time to be\\nill   and that he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his\\ndisease to the neglect of his customary employment   and therefore\\nbidding good  bye to this sort of physician   he resumes his ordinary\\nhabits   and either gets well and lives and does his business   or   if\\nhis constitution fails   he dies and has no more trouble  \\n\\nyes   he said   and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art\\nof medicine thus far only  \\n\\nhas he not   i said   an occupation   and what profit would there be in\\nhis life if he were deprived of his occupation  \\n\\nquite true   he said  \\n\\nbut with the rich man this is otherwise   of him we do not say that he\\nhas any specially appointed work which he must perform   if he would\\nlive  \\n\\nhe is generally supposed to have nothing to do  \\n\\nthen you never heard of the saying of phocylides   that as soon as a man\\nhas a livelihood he should practise virtue  \\n\\nnay   he said   i think that he had better begin somewhat sooner  \\n\\nlet us not have a dispute with him about this   i said   but rather ask\\nourselves   is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man   or can\\nhe live without it   and if obligatory on him   then let us raise a\\nfurther question   whether this dieting of disorders   which is an\\nimpediment to the application of the mind in carpentering and the\\nmechanical arts   does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of\\nphocylides  \\n\\nof that   he replied   there can be no doubt   such excessive care of the\\nbody   when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic   is most inimical to\\nthe practice of virtue  \\n\\nyes   indeed   i replied   and equally incompatible with the management of\\na house   an army   or an office of state   and   what is most important of\\nall   irreconcileable with any kind of study or thought or\\nself  reflection—there is a constant suspicion that headache and\\ngiddiness are to be ascribed to philosophy   and hence all practising or\\nmaking trial of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped   for a\\nman is always fancying that he is being made ill   and is in constant\\nanxiety about the state of his body  \\n\\nyes   likely enough  \\n\\nand therefore our politic asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited\\nthe power of his art only to persons who   being generally of healthy\\nconstitution and habits of life   had a definite ailment   such as these\\nhe cured by purges and operations   and bade them live as usual   herein\\nconsulting the interests of the state   but bodies which disease had\\npenetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure by\\ngradual processes of evacuation and infusion   he did not want to\\nlengthen out good  for  nothing lives   or to have weak fathers begetting\\nweaker sons  —if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had\\nno business to cure him   for such a cure would have been of no use\\neither to himself   or to the state  \\n\\nthen   he said   you regard asclepius as a statesman  \\n\\nclearly   and his character is further illustrated by his sons   note\\nthat they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of\\nwhich i am speaking at the siege of troy   you will remember how   when\\npandarus wounded menelaus   they\\n\\n  sucked the blood out of the wound   and sprinkled soothing remedies    \\n\\nbut they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or\\ndrink in the case of menelaus   any more than in the case of eurypylus  \\nthe remedies   as they conceived   were enough to heal any man who before\\nhe was wounded was healthy and regular in his habits   and even though\\nhe did happen to drink a posset of pramnian wine   he might get well all\\nthe same   but they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and\\nintemperate subjects   whose lives were of no use either to themselves\\nor others   the art of medicine was not designed for their good   and\\nthough they were as rich as midas   the sons of asclepius would have\\ndeclined to attend them  \\n\\nthey were very acute persons   those sons of asclepius  \\n\\nnaturally so   i replied   nevertheless   the tragedians and pindar\\ndisobeying our behests   although they acknowledge that asclepius was\\nthe son of apollo   say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man\\nwho was at the point of death   and for this reason he was struck by\\nlightning   but we   in accordance with the principle already affirmed by\\nus   will not believe them when they tell us both  —if he was the son of\\na god   we maintain that he was not avaricious   or   if he was\\navaricious   he was not the son of a god  \\n\\nall that   socrates   is excellent   but i should like to put a question\\nto you   ought there not to be good physicians in a state   and are not\\nthe best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions\\ngood and bad   and are not the best judges in like manner those who are\\nacquainted with all sorts of moral natures  \\n\\nyes   i said   i too would have good judges and good physicians   but do\\nyou know whom i think good  \\n\\nwill you tell me  \\n\\ni will   if i can   let me however note that in the same question you\\njoin two things which are not the same  \\n\\nhow so   he asked  \\n\\nwhy   i said   you join physicians and judges   now the most skilful\\nphysicians are those who   from their youth upwards   have combined with\\nthe knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease   they had\\nbetter not be robust in health   and should have had all manner of\\ndiseases in their own persons   for the body   as i conceive   is not the\\ninstrument with which they cure the body   in that case we could not\\nallow them ever to be or to have been sickly   but they cure the body\\nwith the mind   and the mind which has become and is sick can cure\\nnothing  \\n\\nthat is very true   he said  \\n\\nbut with the judge it is otherwise   since he governs mind by mind   he\\nought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds   and to\\nhave associated with them from youth upwards   and to have gone through\\nthe whole calendar of crime   only in order that he may quickly infer\\nthe crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own\\nself  consciousness   the honourable mind which is to form a healthy\\njudgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits\\nwhen young   and this is the reason why in youth good men often appear\\nto be simple   and are easily practised upon by the dishonest   because\\nthey have no examples of what evil is in their own souls  \\n\\nyes   he said   they are far too apt to be deceived  \\n\\ntherefore   i said   the judge should not be young   he should have\\nlearned to know evil   not from his own soul   but from late and long\\nobservation of the nature of evil in others   knowledge should be his\\nguide   not personal experience  \\n\\nyes   he said   that is the ideal of a judge  \\n\\nyes   i replied   and he will be a good man   which is my answer to your\\nquestion     for he is good who has a good soul   but the cunning and\\nsuspicious nature of which we spoke  —he who has committed many crimes  \\nand fancies himself to be a master in wickedness   when he is amongst\\nhis fellows   is wonderful in the precautions which he takes   because he\\njudges of them by himself   but when he gets into the company of men of\\nvirtue   who have the experience of age   he appears to be a fool again  \\nowing to his unseasonable suspicions   he cannot recognise an honest\\nman   because he has no pattern of honesty in himself   at the same time  \\nas the bad are more numerous than the good   and he meets with them\\noftener   he thinks himself   and is by others thought to be   rather wise\\nthan foolish  \\n\\nmost true   he said  \\n\\nthen the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man   but\\nthe other   for vice cannot know virtue too   but a virtuous nature  \\neducated by time   will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice   the\\nvirtuous   and not the vicious   man has wisdom—in my opinion  \\n\\nand in mine also  \\n\\nthis is the sort of medicine   and this is the sort of law   which you\\nwill sanction in your state   they will minister to better natures  \\ngiving health both of soul and of body   but those who are diseased in\\ntheir bodies they will leave to die   and the corrupt and incurable\\nsouls they will put an end to themselves  \\n\\nthat is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the state  \\n\\nand thus our youth   having been educated only in that simple music\\nwhich   as we said   inspires temperance   will be reluctant to go to law  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nand the musician   who   keeping to the same track   is content to\\npractise the simple gymnastic   will have nothing to do with medicine\\nunless in some extreme case  \\n\\nthat i quite believe  \\n\\nthe very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to\\nstimulate the spirited element of his nature   and not to increase his\\nstrength   he will not   like common athletes   use exercise and regimen\\nto develope his muscles  \\n\\nvery right   he said  \\n\\nneither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed   as is\\noften supposed   the one for the training of the soul   the other for the\\ntraining of the body  \\n\\nwhat then is the real object of them  \\n\\ni believe   i said   that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the\\nimprovement of the soul  \\n\\nhow can that be   he asked  \\n\\ndid you never observe   i said   the effect on the mind itself of\\nexclusive devotion to gymnastic   or the opposite effect of an exclusive\\ndevotion to music  \\n\\nin what way shown   he said  \\n\\nthe one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity   the other of\\nsoftness and effeminacy   i replied  \\n\\nyes   he said   i am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much\\nof a savage   and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond\\nwhat is good for him  \\n\\nyet surely   i said   this ferocity only comes from spirit   which   if\\nrightly educated   would give courage   but   if too much intensified   is\\nliable to become hard and brutal  \\n\\nthat i quite think  \\n\\non the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness  \\nand this also   when too much indulged   will turn to softness   but   if\\neducated rightly   will be gentle and moderate  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities  \\n\\nassuredly  \\n\\nand both should be in harmony  \\n\\nbeyond question  \\n\\nand the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand   when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul\\nthrough the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs\\nof which we were just now speaking   and his whole life is passed in\\nwarbling and the delights of song   in the first stage of the process\\nthe passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron   and made\\nuseful   instead of brittle and useless   but   if he carries on the\\nsoftening and soothing process   in the next stage he begins to melt and\\nwaste   until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of\\nhis soul   and he becomes a feeble warrior  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nif the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is\\nspeedily accomplished   but if he have a good deal   then the power of\\nmusic weakening the spirit renders him excitable  —on the least\\nprovocation he flames up at once   and is speedily extinguished   instead\\nof having spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite\\nimpracticable  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nand so in gymnastics   if a man takes violent exercise and is a great\\nfeeder   and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy   at\\nfirst the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit  \\nand he becomes twice the man that he was  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand what happens   if he do nothing else   and holds no converse with the\\nmuses   does not even that intelligence which there may be in him  \\nhaving no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or\\nculture   grow feeble and dull and blind   his mind never waking up or\\nreceiving nourishment   and his senses not being purged of their mists  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nand he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy   uncivilized   never using\\nthe weapon of persuasion  —he is like a wild beast   all violence and\\nfierceness   and knows no other way of dealing   and he lives in all\\nignorance and evil conditions   and has no sense of propriety and grace  \\n\\nthat is quite true   he said  \\n\\nand as there are two principles of human nature   one the spirited and\\nthe other the philosophical   some god   as i should say   has given\\nmankind two arts answering to them   and only indirectly to the soul and\\nbody     in order that these two principles   like the strings of an\\ninstrument   may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly\\nharmonized  \\n\\nthat appears to be the intention  \\n\\nand he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions   and\\nbest attempers them to the soul   may be rightly called the true\\nmusician and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the\\nstrings  \\n\\nyou are quite right   socrates  \\n\\nand such a presiding genius will be always required in our state if the\\ngovernment is to last  \\n\\nyes   he will be absolutely necessary  \\n\\nsuch   then   are our principles of nurture and education   where would be\\nthe use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens  \\nor about their hunting and coursing   their gymnastic and equestrian\\ncontests   for these all follow the general principle   and having found\\nthat   we shall have no difficulty in discovering them  \\n\\ni dare say that there will be no difficulty  \\n\\nvery good   i said   then what is the next question   must we not ask who\\nare to be rulers and who subjects  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nthere can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nand that the best of these must rule  \\n\\nthat is also clear  \\n\\nnow   are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to\\nhusbandry  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand as we are to have the best of guardians for our city   must they not\\nbe those who have most the character of guardians  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand to this end they ought to be wise and efficient   and to have a\\nspecial care of the state  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves  \\n\\nto be sure  \\n\\nand he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the\\nsame interests with himself   and that of which the good or evil fortune\\nis supposed by him at any time most to affect his own  \\n\\nvery true   he replied  \\n\\nthen there must be a selection   let us note among the guardians those\\nwho in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for\\nthe good of their country   and the greatest repugnance to do what is\\nagainst her interests  \\n\\nthose are the right men  \\n\\nand they will have to be watched at every age   in order that we may see\\nwhether they preserve their resolution   and never   under the influence\\neither of force or enchantment   forget or cast off their sense of duty\\nto the state  \\n\\nhow cast off   he said  \\n\\ni will explain to you   i replied   a resolution may go out of a man  s\\nmind either with his will or against his will   with his will when he\\ngets rid of a falsehood and learns better   against his will whenever he\\nis deprived of a truth  \\n\\ni understand   he said   the willing loss of a resolution   the meaning of\\nthe unwilling i have yet to learn  \\n\\nwhy   i said   do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good  \\nand willingly of evil   is not to have lost the truth an evil   and to\\npossess the truth a good   and you would agree that to conceive things\\nas they are is to possess the truth  \\n\\nyes   he replied   i agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived\\nof truth against their will  \\n\\nand is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft   or\\nforce   or enchantment  \\n\\nstill   he replied   i do not understand you  \\n\\ni fear that i must have been talking darkly   like the tragedians   i\\nonly mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others\\nforget   argument steals away the hearts of one class   and time of the\\nother   and this i call theft   now you understand me  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthose again who are forced   are those whom the violence of some pain or\\ngrief compels to change their opinion  \\n\\ni understand   he said   and you are quite right  \\n\\nand you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change\\ntheir minds either under the softer influence of pleasure   or the\\nsterner influence of fear  \\n\\nyes   he said   everything that deceives may be said to enchant  \\n\\ntherefore   as i was just now saying   we must enquire who are the best\\nguardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest of\\nthe state is to be the rule of their lives   we must watch them from\\ntheir youth upwards   and make them perform actions in which they are\\nmost likely to forget or to be deceived   and he who remembers and is\\nnot deceived is to be selected   and he who fails in the trial is to be\\nrejected   that will be the way  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for\\nthem   in which they will be made to give further proof of the same\\nqualities  \\n\\nvery right   he replied  \\n\\nand then   i said   we must try them with enchantments—that is the third\\nsort of test—and see what will be their behaviour   like those who take\\ncolts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature   so\\nmust we take our youth amid terrors of some kind   and again pass them\\ninto pleasures   and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in\\nthe furnace   that we may discover whether they are armed against all\\nenchantments   and of a noble bearing always   good guardians of\\nthemselves and of the music which they have learned   and retaining\\nunder all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature   such as\\nwill be most serviceable to the individual and to the state   and he who\\nat every age   as boy and youth and in mature life   has come out of the\\ntrial victorious and pure   shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of\\nthe state   he shall be honoured in life and death   and shall receive\\nsepulture and other memorials of honour   the greatest that we have to\\ngive   but him who fails   we must reject   i am inclined to think that\\nthis is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should be\\nchosen and appointed   i speak generally   and not with any pretension to\\nexactness  \\n\\nand   speaking generally   i agree with you   he said  \\n\\nand perhaps the word   guardian   in the fullest sense ought to be\\napplied to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign\\nenemies and maintain peace among our citizens at home   that the one may\\nnot have the will   or the others the power   to harm us   the young men\\nwhom we before called guardians may be more properly designated\\nauxiliaries and supporters of the principles of the rulers  \\n\\ni agree with you   he said  \\n\\nhow then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we\\nlately spoke—just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers   if that\\nbe possible   and at any rate the rest of the city  \\n\\nwhat sort of lie   he said  \\n\\nnothing new   i replied   only an old phoenician tale   laws   of what has\\noften occurred before now in other places     as the poets say   and have\\nmade the world believe     though not in our time   and i do not know\\nwhether such an event could ever happen again   or could now even be\\nmade probable   if it did  \\n\\nhow your words seem to hesitate on your lips  \\n\\nyou will not wonder   i replied   at my hesitation when you have heard  \\n\\nspeak   he said   and fear not  \\n\\nwell then   i will speak   although i really know not how to look you in\\nthe face   or in what words to utter the audacious fiction   which i\\npropose to communicate gradually   first to the rulers   then to the\\nsoldiers   and lastly to the people   they are to be told that their\\nyouth was a dream   and the education and training which they received\\nfrom us   an appearance only   in reality during all that time they were\\nbeing formed and fed in the womb of the earth   where they themselves\\nand their arms and appurtenances were manufactured   when they were\\ncompleted   the earth   their mother   sent them up   and so   their country\\nbeing their mother and also their nurse   they are bound to advise for\\nher good   and to defend her against attacks   and her citizens they are\\nto regard as children of the earth and their own brothers  \\n\\nyou had good reason   he said   to be ashamed of the lie which you were\\ngoing to tell  \\n\\ntrue   i replied   but there is more coming   i have only told you half  \\ncitizens   we shall say to them in our tale   you are brothers   yet god\\nhas framed you differently   some of you have the power of command   and\\nin the composition of these he has mingled gold   wherefore also they\\nhave the greatest honour   others he has made of silver   to be\\nauxiliaries   others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has\\ncomposed of brass and iron   and the species will generally be preserved\\nin the children   but as all are of the same original stock   a golden\\nparent will sometimes have a silver son   or a silver parent a golden\\nson   and god proclaims as a first principle to the rulers   and above\\nall else   that there is nothing which they should so anxiously guard  \\nor of which they are to be such good guardians   as of the purity of the\\nrace   they should observe what elements mingle in their offspring   for\\nif the son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and\\niron   then nature orders a transposition of ranks   and the eye of the\\nruler must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend\\nin the scale and become a husbandman or artisan   just as there may be\\nsons of artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are\\nraised to honour   and become guardians or auxiliaries   for an oracle\\nsays that when a man of brass or iron guards the state   it will be\\ndestroyed   such is the tale   is there any possibility of making our\\ncitizens believe in it  \\n\\nnot in the present generation   he replied   there is no way of\\naccomplishing this   but their sons may be made to believe in the tale  \\nand their sons   sons   and posterity after them  \\n\\ni see the difficulty   i replied   yet the fostering of such a belief\\nwill make them care more for the city and for one another   enough  \\nhowever   of the fiction   which may now fly abroad upon the wings of\\nrumour   while we arm our earth  born heroes   and lead them forth under\\nthe command of their rulers   let them look round and select a spot\\nwhence they can best suppress insurrection   if any prove refractory\\nwithin   and also defend themselves against enemies   who like wolves may\\ncome down on the fold from without   there let them encamp   and when\\nthey have encamped   let them sacrifice to the proper gods and prepare\\ntheir dwellings  \\n\\njust so   he said  \\n\\nand their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold\\nof winter and the heat of summer  \\n\\ni suppose that you mean houses   he replied  \\n\\nyes   i said   but they must be the houses of soldiers   and not of\\nshop  keepers  \\n\\nwhat is the difference   he said  \\n\\nthat i will endeavour to explain   i replied   to keep watch  dogs   who  \\nfrom want of discipline or hunger   or some evil habit or other   would\\nturn upon the sheep and worry them   and behave not like dogs but\\nwolves   would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd  \\n\\ntruly monstrous   he said  \\n\\nand therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries   being\\nstronger than our citizens   may not grow to be too much for them and\\nbecome savage tyrants instead of friends and allies  \\n\\nyes   great care should be taken  \\n\\nand would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard  \\n\\nbut they are well  educated already   he replied  \\n\\ni cannot be so confident   my dear glaucon   i said   i am much more\\ncertain that they ought to be   and that true education   whatever that\\nmay be   will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them\\nin their relations to one another   and to those who are under their\\nprotection  \\n\\nvery true   he replied  \\n\\nand not only their education   but their habitations   and all that\\nbelongs to them   should be such as will neither impair their virtue as\\nguardians   nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens   any man of\\nsense must acknowledge that  \\n\\nhe must  \\n\\nthen now let us consider what will be their way of life   if they are to\\nrealize our idea of them   in the first place   none of them should have\\nany property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary   neither\\nshould they have a private house or store closed against any one who\\nhas a mind to enter   their provisions should be only such as are\\nrequired by trained warriors   who are men of temperance and courage  \\nthey should agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay  \\nenough to meet the expenses of the year and no more   and they will go\\nto mess and live together like soldiers in a camp   gold and silver we\\nwill tell them that they have from god   the diviner metal is within\\nthem   and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current\\namong men   and ought not to pollute the divine by any such earthly\\nadmixture   for that commoner metal has been the source of many unholy\\ndeeds   but their own is undefiled   and they alone of all the citizens\\nmay not touch or handle silver or gold   or be under the same roof with\\nthem   or wear them   or drink from them   and this will be their\\nsalvation   and they will be the saviours of the state   but should they\\never acquire homes or lands or moneys of their own   they will become\\nhousekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians   enemies and tyrants\\ninstead of allies of the other citizens   hating and being hated  \\nplotting and being plotted against   they will pass their whole life in\\nmuch greater terror of internal than of external enemies   and the hour\\nof ruin   both to themselves and to the rest of the state   will be at\\nhand   for all which reasons may we not say that thus shall our state be\\nordered   and that these shall be the regulations appointed by us for\\nguardians concerning their houses and all other matters  \\n\\nyes   said glaucon  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book iv  \\n\\n\\nhere adeimantus interposed a question   how would you answer   socrates  \\nsaid he   if a person were to say that you are making these people\\nmiserable   and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness   the\\ncity in fact belongs to them   but they are none the better for it  \\nwhereas other men acquire lands   and build large and handsome houses  \\nand have everything handsome about them   offering sacrifices to the\\ngods on their own account   and practising hospitality   moreover   as you\\nwere saying just now   they have gold and silver   and all that is usual\\namong the favourites of fortune   but our poor citizens are no better\\nthan mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting\\nguard  \\n\\nyes   i said   and you may add that they are only fed   and not paid in\\naddition to their food   like other men   and therefore they cannot   if\\nthey would   take a journey of pleasure   they have no money to spend on\\na mistress or any other luxurious fancy   which   as the world goes   is\\nthought to be happiness   and many other accusations of the same nature\\nmight be added  \\n\\nbut   said he   let us suppose all this to be included in the charge  \\n\\nyou mean to ask   i said   what will be our answer  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nif we proceed along the old path   my belief   i said   is that we shall\\nfind the answer   and our answer will be that   even as they are   our\\nguardians may very likely be the happiest of men   but that our aim in\\nfounding the state was not the disproportionate happiness of any one\\nclass   but the greatest happiness of the whole   we thought that in a\\nstate which is ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should\\nbe most likely to find justice   and in the ill  ordered state injustice  \\nand   having found them   we might then decide which of the two is the\\nhappier   at present   i take it   we are fashioning the happy state   not\\npiecemeal   or with a view of making a few happy citizens   but as a\\nwhole   and by  and  by we will proceed to view the opposite kind of\\nstate   suppose that we were painting a statue   and some one came up to\\nus and said   why do you not put the most beautiful colours on the most\\nbeautiful parts of the body—the eyes ought to be purple   but you have\\nmade them black—to him we might fairly answer   sir   you would not\\nsurely have us beautify the eyes to such a degree that they are no\\nlonger eyes   consider rather whether   by giving this and the other\\nfeatures their due proportion   we make the whole beautiful   and so i\\nsay to you   do not compel us to assign to the guardians a sort of\\nhappiness which will make them anything but guardians   for we too can\\nclothe our husbandmen in royal apparel   and set crowns of gold on their\\nheads   and bid them till the ground as much as they like   and no more  \\nour potters also might be allowed to repose on couches   and feast by\\nthe fireside   passing round the winecup   while their wheel is\\nconveniently at hand   and working at pottery only as much as they like  \\nin this way we might make every class happy—and then   as you imagine  \\nthe whole state would be happy   but do not put this idea into our\\nheads   for   if we listen to you   the husbandman will be no longer a\\nhusbandman   the potter will cease to be a potter   and no one will have\\nthe character of any distinct class in the state   now this is not of\\nmuch consequence where the corruption of society   and pretension to be\\nwhat you are not   is confined to cobblers   but when the guardians of\\nthe laws and of the government are only seeming and not real guardians  \\nthen see how they turn the state upside down   and on the other hand\\nthey alone have the power of giving order and happiness to the state  \\nwe mean our guardians to be true saviours and not the destroyers of the\\nstate   whereas our opponent is thinking of peasants at a festival   who\\nare enjoying a life of revelry   not of citizens who are doing their\\nduty to the state   but   if so   we mean different things   and he is\\nspeaking of something which is not a state   and therefore we must\\nconsider whether in appointing our guardians we would look to their\\ngreatest happiness individually   or whether this principle of happiness\\ndoes not rather reside in the state as a whole   but if the latter be\\nthe truth   then the guardians and auxiliaries   and all others equally\\nwith them   must be compelled or induced to do their own work in the\\nbest way   and thus the whole state will grow up in a noble order   and\\nthe several classes will receive the proportion of happiness which\\nnature assigns to them  \\n\\ni think that you are quite right  \\n\\ni wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to me  \\n\\nwhat may that be  \\n\\nthere seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts  \\n\\nwhat are they  \\n\\nwealth   i said   and poverty  \\n\\nhow do they act  \\n\\nthe process is as follows   when a potter becomes rich   will he   think\\nyou   any longer take the same pains with his art  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nhe will grow more and more indolent and careless  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand the result will be that he becomes a worse potter  \\n\\nyes   he greatly deteriorates  \\n\\nbut   on the other hand   if he has no money   and cannot provide himself\\nwith tools or instruments   he will not work equally well himself   nor\\nwill he teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nthen   under the influence either of poverty or of wealth   workmen and\\ntheir work are equally liable to degenerate  \\n\\nthat is evident  \\n\\nhere   then   is a discovery of new evils   i said   against which the\\nguardians will have to watch   or they will creep into the city\\nunobserved  \\n\\nwhat evils  \\n\\nwealth   i said   and poverty   the one is the parent of luxury and\\nindolence   and the other of meanness and viciousness   and both of\\ndiscontent  \\n\\nthat is very true   he replied   but still i should like to know  \\nsocrates   how our city will be able to go to war   especially against an\\nenemy who is rich and powerful   if deprived of the sinews of war  \\n\\nthere would certainly be a difficulty   i replied   in going to war with\\none such enemy   but there is no difficulty where there are two of them  \\n\\nhow so   he asked  \\n\\nin the first place   i said   if we have to fight   our side will be\\ntrained warriors fighting against an army of rich men  \\n\\nthat is true   he said  \\n\\nand do you not suppose   adeimantus   that a single boxer who was perfect\\nin his art would easily be a match for two stout and well  to  do\\ngentlemen who were not boxers  \\n\\nhardly   if they came upon him at once  \\n\\nwhat   now   i said   if he were able to run away and then turn and strike\\nat the one who first came up   and supposing he were to do this several\\ntimes under the heat of a scorching sun   might he not   being an expert  \\noverturn more than one stout personage  \\n\\ncertainly   he said   there would be nothing wonderful in that  \\n\\nand yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the science and\\npractise of boxing than they have in military qualities  \\n\\nlikely enough  \\n\\nthen we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or\\nthree times their own number  \\n\\ni agree with you   for i think you right  \\n\\nand suppose that   before engaging   our citizens send an embassy to one\\nof the two cities   telling them what is the truth   silver and gold we\\nneither have nor are permitted to have   but you may   do you therefore\\ncome and help us in war   and take the spoils of the other city   who   on\\nhearing these words   would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs  \\nrather than   with the dogs on their side   against fat and tender sheep  \\n\\nthat is not likely   and yet there might be a danger to the poor state\\nif the wealth of many states were to be gathered into one  \\n\\nbut how simple of you to use the term state at all of any but our own  \\n\\nwhy so  \\n\\nyou ought to speak of other states in the plural number   not one of\\nthem is a city   but many cities   as they say in the game   for indeed\\nany city   however small   is in fact divided into two   one the city of\\nthe poor   the other of the rich   these are at war with one another   and\\nin either there are many smaller divisions   and you would be altogether\\nbeside the mark if you treated them all as a single state   but if you\\ndeal with them as many   and give the wealth or power or persons of the\\none to the others   you will always have a great many friends and not\\nmany enemies   and your state   while the wise order which has now been\\nprescribed continues to prevail in her   will be the greatest of states  \\ni do not mean to say in reputation or appearance   but in deed and\\ntruth   though she number not more than a thousand defenders   a single\\nstate which is her equal you will hardly find   either among hellenes or\\nbarbarians   though many that appear to be as great and many times\\ngreater  \\n\\nthat is most true   he said  \\n\\nand what   i said   will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when\\nthey are considering the size of the state and the amount of territory\\nwhich they are to include   and beyond which they will not go  \\n\\nwhat limit would you propose  \\n\\ni would allow the state to increase so far as is consistent with unity  \\nthat   i think   is the proper limit  \\n\\nvery good   he said  \\n\\nhere then   i said   is another order which will have to be conveyed to\\nour guardians   let our city be accounted neither large nor small   but\\none and self  sufficing  \\n\\nand surely   said he   this is not a very severe order which we impose\\nupon them  \\n\\nand the other   said i   of which we were speaking before is lighter\\nstill  —i mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians when\\ninferior   and of elevating into the rank of guardians the offspring of\\nthe lower classes   when naturally superior   the intention was   that   in\\nthe case of the citizens generally   each individual should be put to\\nthe use for which nature intended him   one to one work   and then every\\nman would do his own business   and be one and not many   and so the\\nwhole city would be one and not many  \\n\\nyes   he said   that is not so difficult  \\n\\nthe regulations which we are prescribing   my good adeimantus   are not  \\nas might be supposed   a number of great principles   but trifles all   if\\ncare be taken   as the saying is   of the one great thing  —a thing  \\nhowever   which i would rather call   not great   but sufficient for our\\npurpose  \\n\\nwhat may that be   he asked  \\n\\neducation   i said   and nurture   if our citizens are well educated   and\\ngrow into sensible men   they will easily see their way through all\\nthese   as well as other matters which i omit   such   for example   as\\nmarriage   the possession of women and the procreation of children  \\nwhich will all follow the general principle that friends have all\\nthings in common   as the proverb says  \\n\\nthat will be the best way of settling them  \\n\\nalso   i said   the state   if once started well   moves with accumulating\\nforce like a wheel   for good nurture and education implant good\\nconstitutions   and these good constitutions taking root in a good\\neducation improve more and more   and this improvement affects the breed\\nin man as in other animals  \\n\\nvery possibly   he said  \\n\\nthen to sum up   this is the point to which   above all   the attention of\\nour rulers should be directed  —that music and gymnastic be preserved in\\ntheir original form   and no innovation made   they must do their utmost\\nto maintain them intact   and when any one says that mankind most regard\\n\\n  the newest song which the singers have    \\n\\nthey will be afraid that he may be praising   not new songs   but a new\\nkind of song   and this ought not to be praised   or conceived to be the\\nmeaning of the poet   for any musical innovation is full of danger to\\nthe whole state   and ought to be prohibited   so damon tells me   and i\\ncan quite believe him  —he says that when modes of music change   the\\nfundamental laws of the state always change with them  \\n\\nyes   said adeimantus   and you may add my suffrage to damon  s and your\\nown  \\n\\nthen   i said   our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress\\nin music  \\n\\nyes   he said   the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals in  \\n\\nyes   i replied   in the form of amusement   and at first sight it appears\\nharmless  \\n\\nwhy   yes   he said   and there is no harm   were it not that little by\\nlittle this spirit of licence   finding a home   imperceptibly penetrates\\ninto manners and customs   whence   issuing with greater force   it\\ninvades contracts between man and man   and from contracts goes on to\\nlaws and constitutions   in utter recklessness   ending at last  \\nsocrates   by an overthrow of all rights   private as well as public  \\n\\nis that true   i said  \\n\\nthat is my belief   he replied  \\n\\nthen   as i was saying   our youth should be trained from the first in a\\nstricter system   for if amusements become lawless   and the youths\\nthemselves become lawless   they can never grow up into well  conducted\\nand virtuous citizens  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nand when they have made a good beginning in play   and by the help of\\nmusic have gained the habit of good order   then this habit of order   in\\na manner how unlike the lawless play of the others   will accompany them\\nin all their actions and be a principle of growth to them   and if there\\nbe any fallen places in the state will raise them up again  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nthus educated   they will invent for themselves any lesser rules which\\ntheir predecessors have altogether neglected  \\n\\nwhat do you mean  \\n\\ni mean such things as these  —when the young are to be silent before\\ntheir elders   how they are to show respect to them by standing and\\nmaking them sit   what honour is due to parents   what garments or shoes\\nare to be worn   the mode of dressing the hair   deportment and manners\\nin general   you would agree with me  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nbut there is   i think   small wisdom in legislating about such\\nmatters  —i doubt if it is ever done   nor are any precise written\\nenactments about them likely to be lasting  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nit would seem   adeimantus   that the direction in which education starts\\na man   will determine his future life   does not like always attract\\nlike  \\n\\nto be sure  \\n\\nuntil some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good   and\\nmay be the reverse of good  \\n\\nthat is not to be denied  \\n\\nand for this reason   i said   i shall not attempt to legislate further\\nabout them  \\n\\nnaturally enough   he replied  \\n\\nwell   and about the business of the agora   and the ordinary dealings\\nbetween man and man   or again about agreements with artisans   about\\ninsult and injury   or the commencement of actions   and the appointment\\nof juries   what would you say   there may also arise questions about any\\nimpositions and exactions of market and harbour dues which may be\\nrequired   and in general about the regulations of markets   police  \\nharbours   and the like   but   oh heavens   shall we condescend to\\nlegislate on any of these particulars  \\n\\ni think   he said   that there is no need to impose laws about them on\\ngood men   what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough\\nfor themselves  \\n\\nyes   i said   my friend   if god will only preserve to them the laws\\nwhich we have given them  \\n\\nand without divine help   said adeimantus   they will go on for ever\\nmaking and mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining\\nperfection  \\n\\nyou would compare them   i said   to those invalids who   having no\\nself  restraint   will not leave off their habits of intemperance  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nyes   i said   and what a delightful life they lead   they are always\\ndoctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders   and always\\nfancying that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises\\nthem to try  \\n\\nsuch cases are very common   he said   with invalids of this sort  \\n\\nyes   i replied   and the charming thing is that they deem him their\\nworst enemy who tells them the truth   which is simply that   unless they\\ngive up eating and drinking and wenching and idling   neither drug nor\\ncautery nor spell nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail  \\n\\ncharming   he replied   i see nothing charming in going into a passion\\nwith a man who tells you what is right  \\n\\nthese gentlemen   i said   do not seem to be in your good graces  \\n\\nassuredly not  \\n\\nnor would you praise the behaviour of states which act like the men\\nwhom i was just now describing   for are there not ill  ordered states in\\nwhich the citizens are forbidden under pain of death to alter the\\nconstitution   and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under\\nthis regime and indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in\\nanticipating and gratifying their humours is held to be a great and\\ngood statesman—do not these states resemble the persons whom i was\\ndescribing  \\n\\nyes   he said   the states are as bad as the men   and i am very far from\\npraising them  \\n\\nbut do you not admire   i said   the coolness and dexterity of these\\nready ministers of political corruption  \\n\\nyes   he said   i do   but not of all of them   for there are some whom the\\napplause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are\\nreally statesmen   and these are not much to be admired  \\n\\nwhat do you mean   i said   you should have more feeling for them   when a\\nman cannot measure   and a great many others who cannot measure declare\\nthat he is four cubits high   can he help believing what they say  \\n\\nnay   he said   certainly not in that case  \\n\\nwell   then   do not be angry with them   for are they not as good as a\\nplay   trying their hand at paltry reforms such as i was describing  \\nthey are always fancying that by legislation they will make an end of\\nfrauds in contracts   and the other rascalities which i was mentioning  \\nnot knowing that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra  \\n\\nyes   he said   that is just what they are doing  \\n\\ni conceive   i said   that the true legislator will not trouble himself\\nwith this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the\\nconstitution either in an ill  ordered or in a well  ordered state   for\\nin the former they are quite useless   and in the latter there will be\\nno difficulty in devising them   and many of them will naturally flow\\nout of our previous regulations  \\n\\nwhat   then   he said   is still remaining to us of the work of\\nlegislation  \\n\\nnothing to us   i replied   but to apollo   the god of delphi   there\\nremains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of\\nall  \\n\\nwhich are they   he said  \\n\\nthe institution of temples and sacrifices   and the entire service of\\ngods   demigods   and heroes   also the ordering of the repositories of\\nthe dead   and the rites which have to be observed by him who would\\npropitiate the inhabitants of the world below   these are matters of\\nwhich we are ignorant ourselves   and as founders of a city we should be\\nunwise in trusting them to any interpreter but our ancestral deity   he\\nis the god who sits in the centre   on the navel of the earth   and he is\\nthe interpreter of religion to all mankind  \\n\\nyou are right   and we will do as you propose  \\n\\nbut where   amid all this   is justice   son of ariston   tell me where  \\nnow that our city has been made habitable   light a candle and search  \\nand get your brother and polemarchus and the rest of our friends to\\nhelp   and let us see where in it we can discover justice and where\\ninjustice   and in what they differ from one another   and which of them\\nthe man who would be happy should have for his portion   whether seen or\\nunseen by gods and men  \\n\\nnonsense   said glaucon   did you not promise to search yourself   saying\\nthat for you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety  \\n\\ni do not deny that i said so   and as you remind me   i will be as good\\nas my word   but you must join  \\n\\nwe will   he replied  \\n\\nwell   then   i hope to make the discovery in this way   i mean to begin\\nwith the assumption that our state   if rightly ordered   is perfect  \\n\\nthat is most certain  \\n\\nand being perfect   is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and\\njust  \\n\\nthat is likewise clear  \\n\\nand whichever of these qualities we find in the state   the one which is\\nnot found will be the residue  \\n\\nvery good  \\n\\nif there were four things   and we were searching for one of them  \\nwherever it might be   the one sought for might be known to us from the\\nfirst   and there would be no further trouble   or we might know the\\nother three first   and then the fourth would clearly be the one left  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nand is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues   which are\\nalso four in number  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nfirst among the virtues found in the state   wisdom comes into view   and\\nin this i detect a certain peculiarity  \\n\\nwhat is that  \\n\\nthe state which we have been describing is said to be wise as being\\ngood in counsel  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge   for not by ignorance  \\nbut by knowledge   do men counsel well  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nand the kinds of knowledge in a state are many and diverse  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nthere is the knowledge of the carpenter   but is that the sort of\\nknowledge which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel  \\n\\ncertainly not   that would only give a city the reputation of skill in\\ncarpentering  \\n\\nthen a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge\\nwhich counsels for the best about wooden implements  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nnor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots   i said  \\nnor as possessing any other similar knowledge  \\n\\nnot by reason of any of them   he said  \\n\\nnor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth   that would\\ngive the city the name of agricultural  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nwell   i said   and is there any knowledge in our recently  founded state\\namong any of the citizens which advises   not about any particular thing\\nin the state   but about the whole   and considers how a state can best\\ndeal with itself and with other states  \\n\\nthere certainly is  \\n\\nand what is this knowledge   and among whom is it found   i asked  \\n\\nit is the knowledge of the guardians   he replied   and is found among\\nthose whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians  \\n\\nand what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this\\nsort of knowledge  \\n\\nthe name of good in counsel and truly wise  \\n\\nand will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more\\nsmiths  \\n\\nthe smiths   he replied   will be far more numerous  \\n\\nwill not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a\\nname from the profession of some kind of knowledge  \\n\\nmuch the smallest  \\n\\nand so by reason of the smallest part or class   and of the knowledge\\nwhich resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself   the whole\\nstate   being thus constituted according to nature   will be wise   and\\nthis   which has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom   has been\\nordained by nature to be of all classes the least  \\n\\nmost true  \\n\\nthus   then   i said   the nature and place in the state of one of the\\nfour virtues has somehow or other been discovered  \\n\\nand   in my humble opinion   very satisfactorily discovered   he replied  \\n\\nagain   i said   there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of courage  \\nand in what part that quality resides which gives the name of\\ncourageous to the state  \\n\\nhow do you mean  \\n\\nwhy   i said   every one who calls any state courageous or cowardly   will\\nbe thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the state  s\\nbehalf  \\n\\nno one   he replied   would ever think of any other  \\n\\nthe rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly   but\\ntheir courage or cowardice will not   as i conceive   have the effect of\\nmaking the city either the one or the other  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nthe city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which\\npreserves under all circumstances that opinion about the nature of\\nthings to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator\\neducated them   and this is what you term courage  \\n\\ni should like to hear what you are saying once more   for i do not think\\nthat i perfectly understand you  \\n\\ni mean that courage is a kind of salvation  \\n\\nsalvation of what  \\n\\nof the opinion respecting things to be feared   what they are and of\\nwhat nature   which the law implants through education   and i mean by\\nthe words   under all circumstances   to intimate that in pleasure or in\\npain   or under the influence of desire or fear   a man preserves   and\\ndoes not lose this opinion   shall i give you an illustration  \\n\\nif you please  \\n\\nyou know   i said   that dyers   when they want to dye wool for making the\\ntrue sea  purple   begin by selecting their white colour first   this they\\nprepare and dress with much care and pains   in order that the white\\nground may take the purple hue in full perfection   the dyeing then\\nproceeds   and whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast colour  \\nand no washing either with lyes or without them can take away the\\nbloom   but   when the ground has not been duly prepared   you will have\\nnoticed how poor is the look either of purple or of any other colour  \\n\\nyes   he said   i know that they have a washed  out and ridiculous\\nappearance  \\n\\nthen now   i said   you will understand what our object was in selecting\\nour soldiers   and educating them in music and gymnastic   we were\\ncontriving influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the\\nlaws in perfection   and the colour of their opinion about dangers and\\nof every other opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture and\\ntraining   not to be washed away by such potent lyes as\\npleasure—mightier agent far in washing the soul than any soda or lye  \\nor by sorrow   fear   and desire   the mightiest of all other solvents  \\nand this sort of universal saving power of true opinion in conformity\\nwith law about real and false dangers i call and maintain to be\\ncourage   unless you disagree  \\n\\nbut i agree   he replied   for i suppose that you mean to exclude mere\\nuninstructed courage   such as that of a wild beast or of a slave—this  \\nin your opinion   is not the courage which the law ordains   and ought to\\nhave another name  \\n\\nmost certainly  \\n\\nthen i may infer courage to be such as you describe  \\n\\nwhy   yes   said i   you may   and if you add the words   of a citizen     you\\nwill not be far wrong  —hereafter   if you like   we will carry the\\nexamination further   but at present we are seeking not for courage but\\njustice   and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough  \\n\\nyou are right   he replied  \\n\\ntwo virtues remain to be discovered in the state—first   temperance   and\\nthen justice which is the end of our search  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nnow   can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance  \\n\\ni do not know how that can be accomplished   he said   nor do i desire\\nthat justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of  \\nand therefore i wish that you would do me the favour of considering\\ntemperance first  \\n\\ncertainly   i replied   i should not be justified in refusing your\\nrequest  \\n\\nthen consider   he said  \\n\\nyes   i replied   i will   and as far as i can at present see   the virtue\\nof temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than the\\npreceding  \\n\\nhow so   he asked  \\n\\ntemperance   i replied   is the ordering or controlling of certain\\npleasures and desires   this is curiously enough implied in the saying\\nof   a man being his own master     and other traces of the same notion\\nmay be found in language  \\n\\nno doubt   he said  \\n\\nthere is something ridiculous in the expression   master of himself    \\nfor the master is also the servant and the servant the master   and in\\nall these modes of speaking the same person is denoted  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nthe meaning is   i believe   that in the human soul there is a better and\\nalso a worse principle   and when the better has the worse under\\ncontrol   then a man is said to be master of himself   and this is a term\\nof praise   but when   owing to evil education or association   the better\\nprinciple   which is also the smaller   is overwhelmed by the greater\\nmass of the worse—in this case he is blamed and is called the slave of\\nself and unprincipled  \\n\\nyes   there is reason in that  \\n\\nand now   i said   look at our newly  created state   and there you will\\nfind one of these two conditions realized   for the state   as you will\\nacknowledge   may be justly called master of itself   if the words\\n  temperance   and   self  mastery   truly express the rule of the better\\npart over the worse  \\n\\nyes   he said   i see that what you say is true  \\n\\nlet me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires\\nand pains are generally found in children and women and servants   and\\nin the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class  \\n\\ncertainly   he said  \\n\\nwhereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason   and are\\nunder the guidance of mind and true opinion   are to be found only in a\\nfew   and those the best born and best educated  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nthese two   as you may perceive   have a place in our state   and the\\nmeaner desires of the many are held down by the virtuous desires and\\nwisdom of the few  \\n\\nthat i perceive   he said  \\n\\nthen if there be any city which may be described as master of its own\\npleasures and desires   and master of itself   ours may claim such a\\ndesignation  \\n\\ncertainly   he replied  \\n\\nit may also be called temperate   and for the same reasons  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand if there be any state in which rulers and subjects will be agreed\\nas to the question who are to rule   that again will be our state  \\n\\nundoubtedly  \\n\\nand the citizens being thus agreed among themselves   in which class\\nwill temperance be found—in the rulers or in the subjects  \\n\\nin both   as i should imagine   he replied  \\n\\ndo you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance\\nwas a sort of harmony  \\n\\nwhy so  \\n\\nwhy   because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom   each of which\\nresides in a part only   the one making the state wise and the other\\nvaliant   not so temperance   which extends to the whole   and runs\\nthrough all the notes of the scale   and produces a harmony of the\\nweaker and the stronger and the middle class   whether you suppose them\\nto be stronger or weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth   or\\nanything else   most truly then may we deem temperance to be the\\nagreement of the naturally superior and inferior   as to the right to\\nrule of either   both in states and individuals  \\n\\ni entirely agree with you  \\n\\nand so   i said   we may consider three out of the four virtues to have\\nbeen discovered in our state   the last of those qualities which make a\\nstate virtuous must be justice   if we only knew what that was  \\n\\nthe inference is obvious  \\n\\nthe time then has arrived   glaucon   when   like huntsmen   we should\\nsurround the cover   and look sharp that justice does not steal away  \\nand pass out of sight and escape us   for beyond a doubt she is\\nsomewhere in this country   watch therefore and strive to catch a sight\\nof her   and if you see her first   let me know  \\n\\nwould that i could   but you should regard me rather as a follower who\\nhas just eyes enough to see what you show him—that is about as much as\\ni am good for  \\n\\noffer up a prayer with me and follow  \\n\\ni will   but you must show me the way  \\n\\nhere is no path   i said   and the wood is dark and perplexing   still we\\nmust push on  \\n\\nlet us push on  \\n\\nhere i saw something   halloo   i said   i begin to perceive a track   and\\ni believe that the quarry will not escape  \\n\\ngood news   he said  \\n\\ntruly   i said   we are stupid fellows  \\n\\nwhy so  \\n\\nwhy   my good sir   at the beginning of our enquiry   ages ago   there was\\njustice tumbling out at our feet   and we never saw her   nothing could\\nbe more ridiculous   like people who go about looking for what they have\\nin their hands—that was the way with us—we looked not at what we were\\nseeking   but at what was far off in the distance   and therefore   i\\nsuppose   we missed her  \\n\\nwhat do you mean  \\n\\ni mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking\\nof justice   and have failed to recognise her  \\n\\ni grow impatient at the length of your exordium  \\n\\nwell then   tell me   i said   whether i am right or not   you remember the\\noriginal principle which we were always laying down at the foundation\\nof the state   that one man should practise one thing only   the thing to\\nwhich his nature was best adapted  —now justice is this principle or a\\npart of it  \\n\\nyes   we often said that one man should do one thing only  \\n\\nfurther   we affirmed that justice was doing one  s own business   and not\\nbeing a busybody   we said so again and again   and many others have said\\nthe same to us  \\n\\nyes   we said so  \\n\\nthen to do one  s own business in a certain way may be assumed to be\\njustice   can you tell me whence i derive this inference  \\n\\ni cannot   but i should like to be told  \\n\\nbecause i think that this is the only virtue which remains in the state\\nwhen the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom are\\nabstracted   and   that this is the ultimate cause and condition of the\\nexistence of all of them   and while remaining in them is also their\\npreservative   and we were saying that if the three were discovered by\\nus   justice would be the fourth or remaining one  \\n\\nthat follows of necessity  \\n\\nif we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its\\npresence contributes most to the excellence of the state   whether the\\nagreement of rulers and subjects   or the preservation in the soldiers\\nof the opinion which the law ordains about the true nature of dangers  \\nor wisdom and watchfulness in the rulers   or whether this other which i\\nam mentioning   and which is found in children and women   slave and\\nfreeman   artisan   ruler   subject  —the quality   i mean   of every one\\ndoing his own work   and not being a busybody   would claim the palm—the\\nquestion is not so easily answered  \\n\\ncertainly   he replied   there would be a difficulty in saying which  \\n\\nthen the power of each individual in the state to do his own work\\nappears to compete with the other political virtues   wisdom  \\ntemperance   courage  \\n\\nyes   he said  \\n\\nand the virtue which enters into this competition is justice  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nlet us look at the question from another point of view   are not the\\nrulers in a state those to whom you would entrust the office of\\ndetermining suits at law  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither\\ntake what is another  s   nor be deprived of what is his own  \\n\\nyes   that is their principle  \\n\\nwhich is a just principle  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthen on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and\\ndoing what is a man  s own   and belongs to him  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nthink   now   and say whether you agree with me or not   suppose a\\ncarpenter to be doing the business of a cobbler   or a cobbler of a\\ncarpenter   and suppose them to exchange their implements or their\\nduties   or the same person to be doing the work of both   or whatever be\\nthe change   do you think that any great harm would result to the state  \\n\\nnot much  \\n\\nbut when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a\\ntrader   having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number\\nof his followers   or any like advantage   attempts to force his way into\\nthe class of warriors   or a warrior into that of legislators and\\nguardians   for which he is unfitted   and either to take the implements\\nor the duties of the other   or when one man is trader   legislator   and\\nwarrior all in one   then i think you will agree with me in saying that\\nthis interchange and this meddling of one with another is the ruin of\\nthe state  \\n\\nmost true  \\n\\nseeing then   i said   that there are three distinct classes   any\\nmeddling of one with another   or the change of one into another   is the\\ngreatest harm to the state   and may be most justly termed evil  doing  \\n\\nprecisely  \\n\\nand the greatest degree of evil  doing to one  s own city would be termed\\nby you injustice  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nthis then is injustice   and on the other hand when the trader   the\\nauxiliary   and the guardian each do their own business   that is\\njustice   and will make the city just  \\n\\ni agree with you  \\n\\nwe will not   i said   be over  positive as yet   but if   on trial   this\\nconception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in the\\nstate   there will be no longer any room for doubt   if it be not\\nverified   we must have a fresh enquiry   first let us complete the old\\ninvestigation   which we began   as you remember   under the impression\\nthat   if we could previously examine justice on the larger scale   there\\nwould be less difficulty in discerning her in the individual   that\\nlarger example appeared to be the state   and accordingly we constructed\\nas good a one as we could   knowing well that in the good state justice\\nwould be found   let the discovery which we made be now applied to the\\nindividual—if they agree   we shall be satisfied   or   if there be a\\ndifference in the individual   we will come back to the state and have\\nanother trial of the theory   the friction of the two when rubbed\\ntogether may possibly strike a light in which justice will shine forth  \\nand the vision which is then revealed we will fix in our souls  \\n\\nthat will be in regular course   let us do as you say  \\n\\ni proceeded to ask   when two things   a greater and less   are called by\\nthe same name   are they like or unlike in so far as they are called the\\nsame  \\n\\nlike   he replied  \\n\\nthe just man then   if we regard the idea of justice only   will be like\\nthe just state  \\n\\nhe will  \\n\\nand a state was thought by us to be just when the three classes in the\\nstate severally did their own business   and also thought to be\\ntemperate and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections\\nand qualities of these same classes  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nand so of the individual   we may assume that he has the same three\\nprinciples in his own soul which are found in the state   and he may be\\nrightly described in the same terms   because he is affected in the same\\nmanner  \\n\\ncertainly   he said  \\n\\nonce more then   o my friend   we have alighted upon an easy\\nquestion—whether the soul has these three principles or not  \\n\\nan easy question   nay   rather   socrates   the proverb holds that hard is\\nthe good  \\n\\nvery true   i said   and i do not think that the method which we are\\nemploying is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question  \\nthe true method is another and a longer one   still we may arrive at a\\nsolution not below the level of the previous enquiry  \\n\\nmay we not be satisfied with that   he said  —under the circumstances   i\\nam quite content  \\n\\ni too   i replied   shall be extremely well satisfied  \\n\\nthen faint not in pursuing the speculation   he said  \\n\\nmust we not acknowledge   i said   that in each of us there are the same\\nprinciples and habits which there are in the state   and that from the\\nindividual they pass into the state  —how else can they come there   take\\nthe quality of passion or spirit  —it would be ridiculous to imagine\\nthat this quality   when found in states   is not derived from the\\nindividuals who are supposed to possess it   e  g   the thracians  \\nscythians   and in general the northern nations   and the same may be\\nsaid of the love of knowledge   which is the special characteristic of\\nour part of the world   or of the love of money   which may   with equal\\ntruth   be attributed to the phoenicians and egyptians  \\n\\nexactly so   he said  \\n\\nthere is no difficulty in understanding this  \\n\\nnone whatever  \\n\\nbut the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether\\nthese principles are three or one   whether   that is to say   we learn\\nwith one part of our nature   are angry with another   and with a third\\npart desire the satisfaction of our natural appetites   or whether the\\nwhole soul comes into play in each sort of action—to determine that is\\nthe difficulty  \\n\\nyes   he said   there lies the difficulty  \\n\\nthen let us now try and determine whether they are the same or\\ndifferent  \\n\\nhow can we   he asked  \\n\\ni replied as follows   the same thing clearly cannot act or be acted\\nupon in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same\\ntime   in contrary ways   and therefore whenever this contradiction\\noccurs in things apparently the same   we know that they are really not\\nthe same   but different  \\n\\ngood  \\n\\nfor example   i said   can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the\\nsame time in the same part  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nstill   i said   let us have a more precise statement of terms   lest we\\nshould hereafter fall out by the way   imagine the case of a man who is\\nstanding and also moving his hands and his head   and suppose a person\\nto say that one and the same person is in motion and at rest at the\\nsame moment—to such a mode of speech we should object   and should\\nrather say that one part of him is in motion while another is at rest  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand suppose the objector to refine still further   and to draw the nice\\ndistinction that not only parts of tops   but whole tops   when they spin\\nround with their pegs fixed on the spot   are at rest and in motion at\\nthe same time   and he may say the same of anything which revolves in\\nthe same spot     his objection would not be admitted by us   because in\\nsuch cases things are not at rest and in motion in the same parts of\\nthemselves   we should rather say that they have both an axis and a\\ncircumference   and that the axis stands still   for there is no\\ndeviation from the perpendicular   and that the circumference goes\\nround   but if   while revolving   the axis inclines either to the right\\nor left   forwards or backwards   then in no point of view can they be at\\nrest  \\n\\nthat is the correct mode of describing them   he replied  \\n\\nthen none of these objections will confuse us   or incline us to believe\\nthat the same thing at the same time   in the same part or in relation\\nto the same thing   can act or be acted upon in contrary ways  \\n\\ncertainly not   according to my way of thinking  \\n\\nyet   i said   that we may not be compelled to examine all such\\nobjections   and prove at length that they are untrue   let us assume\\ntheir absurdity   and go forward on the understanding that hereafter   if\\nthis assumption turn out to be untrue   all the consequences which\\nfollow shall be withdrawn  \\n\\nyes   he said   that will be the best way  \\n\\nwell   i said   would you not allow that assent and dissent   desire and\\naversion   attraction and repulsion   are all of them opposites   whether\\nthey are regarded as active or passive   for that makes no difference in\\nthe fact of their opposition    \\n\\nyes   he said   they are opposites  \\n\\nwell   i said   and hunger and thirst   and the desires in general   and\\nagain willing and wishing  —all these you would refer to the classes\\nalready mentioned   you would say—would you not  —that the soul of him\\nwho desires is seeking after the object of his desire   or that he is\\ndrawing to himself the thing which he wishes to possess   or again   when\\na person wants anything to be given him   his mind   longing for the\\nrealization of his desire   intimates his wish to have it by a nod of\\nassent   as if he had been asked a question  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence of\\ndesire   should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion\\nand rejection  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nadmitting this to be true of desire generally   let us suppose a\\nparticular class of desires   and out of these we will select hunger and\\nthirst   as they are termed   which are the most obvious of them  \\n\\nlet us take that class   he said  \\n\\nthe object of one is food   and of the other drink  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand here comes the point   is not thirst the desire which the soul has\\nof drink   and of drink only   not of drink qualified by anything else  \\nfor example   warm or cold   or much or little   or   in a word   drink of\\nany particular sort   but if the thirst be accompanied by heat   then the\\ndesire is of cold drink   or   if accompanied by cold   then of warm\\ndrink   or   if the thirst be excessive   then the drink which is desired\\nwill be excessive   or   if not great   the quantity of drink will also be\\nsmall   but thirst pure and simple will desire drink pure and simple  \\nwhich is the natural satisfaction of thirst   as food is of hunger  \\n\\nyes   he said   the simple desire is   as you say   in every case of the\\nsimple object   and the qualified desire of the qualified object  \\n\\nbut here a confusion may arise   and i should wish to guard against an\\nopponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only   but\\ngood drink   or food only   but good food   for good is the universal\\nobject of desire   and thirst being a desire   will necessarily be thirst\\nafter good drink   and the same is true of every other desire  \\n\\nyes   he replied   the opponent might have something to say  \\n\\nnevertheless i should still maintain   that of relatives some have a\\nquality attached to either term of the relation   others are simple and\\nhave their correlatives simple  \\n\\ni do not know what you mean  \\n\\nwell   you know of course that the greater is relative to the less  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand the much greater to the much less  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand the sometime greater to the sometime less   and the greater that is\\nto be to the less that is to be  \\n\\ncertainly   he said  \\n\\nand so of more and less   and of other correlative terms   such as the\\ndouble and the half   or again   the heavier and the lighter   the swifter\\nand the slower   and of hot and cold   and of any other relatives  —is not\\nthis true of all of them  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand does not the same principle hold in the sciences   the object of\\nscience is knowledge   assuming that to be the true definition     but the\\nobject of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge   i\\nmean   for example   that the science of house  building is a kind of\\nknowledge which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and is\\ntherefore termed architecture  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nbecause it has a particular quality which no other has  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand it has this particular quality because it has an object of a\\nparticular kind   and this is true of the other arts and sciences  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nnow   then   if i have made myself clear   you will understand my original\\nmeaning in what i said about relatives   my meaning was   that if one\\nterm of a relation is taken alone   the other is taken alone   if one\\nterm is qualified   the other is also qualified   i do not mean to say\\nthat relatives may not be disparate   or that the science of health is\\nhealthy   or of disease necessarily diseased   or that the sciences of\\ngood and evil are therefore good and evil   but only that   when the term\\nscience is no longer used absolutely   but has a qualified object which\\nin this case is the nature of health and disease   it becomes defined  \\nand is hence called not merely science   but the science of medicine  \\n\\ni quite understand   and i think as you do  \\n\\nwould you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative\\nterms   having clearly a relation—\\n\\nyes   thirst is relative to drink  \\n\\nand a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink  \\nbut thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little   nor of good nor\\nbad   nor of any particular kind of drink   but of drink only  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nthen the soul of the thirsty one   in so far as he is thirsty   desires\\nonly drink   for this he yearns and tries to obtain it  \\n\\nthat is plain  \\n\\nand if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from\\ndrink   that must be different from the thirsty principle which draws\\nhim like a beast to drink   for   as we were saying   the same thing\\ncannot at the same time with the same part of itself act in contrary\\nways about the same  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nno more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and pull the\\nbow at the same time   but what you say is that one hand pushes and the\\nother pulls  \\n\\nexactly so   he replied  \\n\\nand might a man be thirsty   and yet unwilling to drink  \\n\\nyes   he said   it constantly happens  \\n\\nand in such a case what is one to say   would you not say that there was\\nsomething in the soul bidding a man to drink   and something else\\nforbidding him   which is other and stronger than the principle which\\nbids him  \\n\\ni should say so  \\n\\nand the forbidding principle is derived from reason   and that which\\nbids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nthen we may fairly assume that they are two   and that they differ from\\none another   the one with which a man reasons   we may call the rational\\nprinciple of the soul   the other   with which he loves and hungers and\\nthirsts and feels the flutterings of any other desire   may be termed\\nthe irrational or appetitive   the ally of sundry pleasures and\\nsatisfactions  \\n\\nyes   he said   we may fairly assume them to be different  \\n\\nthen let us finally determine that there are two principles existing in\\nthe soul   and what of passion   or spirit   is it a third   or akin to one\\nof the preceding  \\n\\ni should be inclined to say—akin to desire  \\n\\nwell   i said   there is a story which i remember to have heard   and in\\nwhich i put faith   the story is   that leontius   the son of aglaion  \\ncoming up one day from the piraeus   under the north wall on the\\noutside   observed some dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of\\nexecution   he felt a desire to see them   and also a dread and\\nabhorrence of them   for a time he struggled and covered his eyes   but\\nat length the desire got the better of him   and forcing them open   he\\nran up to the dead bodies   saying   look   ye wretches   take your fill of\\nthe fair sight  \\n\\ni have heard the story myself   he said  \\n\\nthe moral of the tale is   that anger at times goes to war with desire  \\nas though they were two distinct things  \\n\\nyes   that is the meaning   he said  \\n\\nand are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a\\nman  s desires violently prevail over his reason   he reviles himself  \\nand is angry at the violence within him   and that in this struggle  \\nwhich is like the struggle of factions in a state   his spirit is on the\\nside of his reason  —but for the passionate or spirited element to take\\npart with the desires when reason decides that she should not be\\nopposed   is a sort of thing which i believe that you never observed\\noccurring in yourself   nor   as i should imagine   in any one else  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nsuppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another   the nobler he\\nis the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering   such as\\nhunger   or cold   or any other pain which the injured person may inflict\\nupon him—these he deems to be just   and   as i say   his anger refuses to\\nbe excited by them  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nbut when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong   then he boils\\nand chafes   and is on the side of what he believes to be justice   and\\nbecause he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more\\ndetermined to persevere and conquer   his noble spirit will not be\\nquelled until he either slays or is slain   or until he hears the voice\\nof the shepherd   that is   reason   bidding his dog bark no more  \\n\\nthe illustration is perfect   he replied   and in our state   as we were\\nsaying   the auxiliaries were to be dogs   and to hear the voice of the\\nrulers   who are their shepherds  \\n\\ni perceive   i said   that you quite understand me   there is   however   a\\nfurther point which i wish you to consider  \\n\\nwhat point  \\n\\nyou remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a\\nkind of desire   but now we should say quite the contrary   for in the\\nconflict of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational\\nprinciple  \\n\\nmost assuredly  \\n\\nbut a further question arises   is passion different from reason also  \\nor only a kind of reason   in which latter case   instead of three\\nprinciples in the soul   there will only be two   the rational and the\\nconcupiscent   or rather   as the state was composed of three classes  \\ntraders   auxiliaries   counsellors   so may there not be in the\\nindividual soul a third element which is passion or spirit   and when\\nnot corrupted by bad education is the natural auxiliary of reason  \\n\\nyes   he said   there must be a third  \\n\\nyes   i replied   if passion   which has already been shown to be\\ndifferent from desire   turn out also to be different from reason  \\n\\nbut that is easily proved  —we may observe even in young children that\\nthey are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born   whereas some\\nof them never seem to attain to the use of reason   and most of them\\nlate enough  \\n\\nexcellent   i said   and you may see passion equally in brute animals  \\nwhich is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying   and we\\nmay once more appeal to the words of homer   which have been already\\nquoted by us  \\n\\n  he smote his breast   and thus rebuked his soul    \\n\\nfor in this verse homer has clearly supposed the power which reasons\\nabout the better and worse to be different from the unreasoning anger\\nwhich is rebuked by it  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nand so   after much tossing   we have reached land   and are fairly agreed\\nthat the same principles which exist in the state exist also in the\\nindividual   and that they are three in number  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nmust we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way   and\\nin virtue of the same quality which makes the state wise  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nalso that the same quality which constitutes courage in the state\\nconstitutes courage in the individual   and that both the state and the\\nindividual bear the same relation to all the other virtues  \\n\\nassuredly  \\n\\nand the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same\\nway in which the state is just  \\n\\nthat follows   of course  \\n\\nwe cannot but remember that the justice of the state consisted in each\\nof the three classes doing the work of its own class  \\n\\nwe are not very likely to have forgotten   he said  \\n\\nwe must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of\\nhis nature do their own work will be just   and will do his own work  \\n\\nyes   he said   we must remember that too  \\n\\nand ought not the rational principle   which is wise   and has the care\\nof the whole soul   to rule   and the passionate or spirited principle to\\nbe the subject and ally  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand   as we were saying   the united influence of music and gymnastic\\nwill bring them into accord   nerving and sustaining the reason with\\nnoble words and lessons   and moderating and soothing and civilizing the\\nwildness of passion by harmony and rhythm  \\n\\nquite true   he said  \\n\\nand these two   thus nurtured and educated   and having learned truly to\\nknow their own functions   will rule over the concupiscent   which in\\neach of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most\\ninsatiable of gain   over this they will keep guard   lest   waxing great\\nand strong with the fulness of bodily pleasures   as they are termed  \\nthe concupiscent soul   no longer confined to her own sphere   should\\nattempt to enslave and rule those who are not her natural  born\\nsubjects   and overturn the whole life of man  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nboth together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul and\\nthe whole body against attacks from without   the one counselling   and\\nthe other fighting under his leader   and courageously executing his\\ncommands and counsels  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and\\nin pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to\\nfear  \\n\\nright   he replied  \\n\\nand him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules   and\\nwhich proclaims these commands   that part too being supposed to have a\\nknowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of\\nthe whole  \\n\\nassuredly  \\n\\nand would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements\\nin friendly harmony   in whom the one ruling principle of reason   and\\nthe two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that\\nreason ought to rule   and do not rebel  \\n\\ncertainly   he said   that is the true account of temperance whether in\\nthe state or individual  \\n\\nand surely   i said   we have explained again and again how and by virtue\\nof what quality a man will be just  \\n\\nthat is very certain  \\n\\nand is justice dimmer in the individual   and is her form different   or\\nis she the same which we found her to be in the state  \\n\\nthere is no difference in my opinion   he said  \\n\\nbecause   if any doubt is still lingering in our minds   a few\\ncommonplace instances will satisfy us of the truth of what i am saying  \\n\\nwhat sort of instances do you mean  \\n\\nif the case is put to us   must we not admit that the just state   or the\\nman who is trained in the principles of such a state   will be less\\nlikely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver  \\nwould any one deny this  \\n\\nno one   he replied  \\n\\nwill the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft   or\\ntreachery either to his friends or to his country  \\n\\nnever  \\n\\nneither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or\\nagreements  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nno one will be less likely to commit adultery   or to dishonour his\\nfather and mother   or to fail in his religious duties  \\n\\nno one  \\n\\nand the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business  \\nwhether in ruling or being ruled  \\n\\nexactly so  \\n\\nare you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such\\nstates is justice   or do you hope to discover some other  \\n\\nnot i   indeed  \\n\\nthen our dream has been realized   and the suspicion which we\\nentertained at the beginning of our work of construction   that some\\ndivine power must have conducted us to a primary form of justice   has\\nnow been verified  \\n\\nyes   certainly  \\n\\nand the division of labour which required the carpenter and the\\nshoemaker and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own\\nbusiness   and not another  s   was a shadow of justice   and for that\\nreason it was of use  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nbut in reality justice was such as we were describing   being concerned\\nhowever   not with the outward man   but with the inward   which is the\\ntrue self and concernment of man   for the just man does not permit the\\nseveral elements within him to interfere with one another   or any of\\nthem to do the work of others  —he sets in order his own inner life   and\\nis his own master and his own law   and at peace with himself   and when\\nhe has bound together the three principles within him   which may be\\ncompared to the higher   lower   and middle notes of the scale   and the\\nintermediate intervals—when he has bound all these together   and is no\\nlonger many   but has become one entirely temperate and perfectly\\nadjusted nature   then he proceeds to act   if he has to act   whether in\\na matter of property   or in the treatment of the body   or in some\\naffair of politics or private business   always thinking and calling\\nthat which preserves and co  operates with this harmonious condition  \\njust and good action   and the knowledge which presides over it   wisdom  \\nand that which at any time impairs this condition   he will call unjust\\naction   and the opinion which presides over it ignorance  \\n\\nyou have said the exact truth   socrates  \\n\\nvery good   and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man\\nand the just state   and the nature of justice in each of them   we\\nshould not be telling a falsehood  \\n\\nmost certainly not  \\n\\nmay we say so   then  \\n\\nlet us say so  \\n\\nand now   i said   injustice has to be considered  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nmust not injustice be a strife which arises among the three\\nprinciples—a meddlesomeness   and interference   and rising up of a part\\nof the soul against the whole   an assertion of unlawful authority  \\nwhich is made by a rebellious subject against a true prince   of whom he\\nis the natural vassal  —what is all this confusion and delusion but\\ninjustice   and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance   and every form\\nof vice  \\n\\nexactly so  \\n\\nand if the nature of justice and injustice be known   then the meaning\\nof acting unjustly and being unjust   or   again   of acting justly   will\\nalso be perfectly clear  \\n\\nwhat do you mean   he said  \\n\\nwhy   i said   they are like disease and health   being in the soul just\\nwhat disease and health are in the body  \\n\\nhow so   he said  \\n\\nwhy   i said   that which is healthy causes health   and that which is\\nunhealthy causes disease  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand just actions cause justice   and unjust actions cause injustice  \\n\\nthat is certain  \\n\\nand the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and\\ngovernment of one by another in the parts of the body   and the creation\\nof disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this\\nnatural order  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order\\nand government of one by another in the parts of the soul   and the\\ncreation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance\\nwith the natural order  \\n\\nexactly so   he said  \\n\\nthen virtue is the health and beauty and well  being of the soul   and\\nvice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand do not good practices lead to virtue   and evil practices to vice  \\n\\nassuredly  \\n\\nstill our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and\\ninjustice has not been answered   which is the more profitable   to be\\njust and act justly and practise virtue   whether seen or unseen of gods\\nand men   or to be unjust and act unjustly   if only unpunished and\\nunreformed  \\n\\nin my judgment   socrates   the question has now become ridiculous   we\\nknow that   when the bodily constitution is gone   life is no longer\\nendurable   though pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks   and\\nhaving all wealth and all power   and shall we be told that when the\\nvery essence of the vital principle is undermined and corrupted   life\\nis still worth having to a man   if only he be allowed to do whatever he\\nlikes with the single exception that he is not to acquire justice and\\nvirtue   or to escape from injustice and vice   assuming them both to be\\nsuch as we have described  \\n\\nyes   i said   the question is   as you say   ridiculous   still   as we are\\nnear the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner with\\nour own eyes   let us not faint by the way  \\n\\ncertainly not   he replied  \\n\\ncome up hither   i said   and behold the various forms of vice   those of\\nthem   i mean   which are worth looking at  \\n\\ni am following you   he replied   proceed  \\n\\ni said   the argument seems to have reached a height from which   as from\\nsome tower of speculation   a man may look down and see that virtue is\\none   but that the forms of vice are innumerable   there being four\\nspecial ones which are deserving of note  \\n\\nwhat do you mean   he said  \\n\\ni mean   i replied   that there appear to be as many forms of the soul as\\nthere are distinct forms of the state  \\n\\nhow many  \\n\\nthere are five of the state   and five of the soul   i said  \\n\\nwhat are they  \\n\\nthe first   i said   is that which we have been describing   and which may\\nbe said to have two names   monarchy and aristocracy   accordingly as\\nrule is exercised by one distinguished man or by many  \\n\\ntrue   he replied  \\n\\nbut i regard the two names as describing one form only   for whether the\\ngovernment is in the hands of one or many   if the governors have been\\ntrained in the manner which we have supposed   the fundamental laws of\\nthe state will be maintained  \\n\\nthat is true   he replied  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book v  \\n\\n\\nsuch is the good and true city or state   and the good and true man is\\nof the same pattern   and if this is right every other is wrong   and the\\nevil is one which affects not only the ordering of the state   but also\\nthe regulation of the individual soul   and is exhibited in four forms  \\n\\nwhat are they   he said  \\n\\ni was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil forms\\nappeared to me to succeed one another   when polemarchus   who was\\nsitting a little way off   just beyond adeimantus   began to whisper to\\nhim   stretching forth his hand   he took hold of the upper part of his\\ncoat by the shoulder   and drew him towards him   leaning forward himself\\nso as to be quite close and saying something in his ear   of which i\\nonly caught the words     shall we let him off   or what shall we do    \\n\\ncertainly not   said adeimantus   raising his voice  \\n\\nwho is it   i said   whom you are refusing to let off  \\n\\nyou   he said  \\n\\ni repeated   why am i especially not to be let off  \\n\\nwhy   he said   we think that you are lazy   and mean to cheat us out of a\\nwhole chapter which is a very important part of the story   and you\\nfancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding   as if it\\nwere self  evident to everybody   that in the matter of women and\\nchildren   friends have all things in common    \\n\\nand was i not right   adeimantus  \\n\\nyes   he said   but what is right in this particular case   like\\neverything else   requires to be explained   for community may be of many\\nkinds   please   therefore   to say what sort of community you mean   we\\nhave been long expecting that you would tell us something about the\\nfamily life of your citizens—how they will bring children into the\\nworld   and rear them when they have arrived   and   in general   what is\\nthe nature of this community of women and children—for we are of\\nopinion that the right or wrong management of such matters will have a\\ngreat and paramount influence on the state for good or for evil   and\\nnow   since the question is still undetermined   and you are taking in\\nhand another state   we have resolved   as you heard   not to let you go\\nuntil you give an account of all this  \\n\\nto that resolution   said glaucon   you may regard me as saying agreed  \\n\\nand without more ado   said thrasymachus   you may consider us all to be\\nequally agreed  \\n\\ni said   you know not what you are doing in thus assailing me   what an\\nargument are you raising about the state   just as i thought that i had\\nfinished   and was only too glad that i had laid this question to sleep  \\nand was reflecting how fortunate i was in your acceptance of what i\\nthen said   you ask me to begin again at the very foundation   ignorant\\nof what a hornet  s nest of words you are stirring   now i foresaw this\\ngathering trouble   and avoided it  \\n\\nfor what purpose do you conceive that we have come here   said\\nthrasymachus  —to look for gold   or to hear discourse  \\n\\nyes   but discourse should have a limit  \\n\\nyes   socrates   said glaucon   and the whole of life is the only limit\\nwhich wise men assign to the hearing of such discourses   but never mind\\nabout us   take heart yourself and answer the question in your own way  \\nwhat sort of community of women and children is this which is to\\nprevail among our guardians   and how shall we manage the period between\\nbirth and education   which seems to require the greatest care   tell us\\nhow these things will be  \\n\\nyes   my simple friend   but the answer is the reverse of easy   many more\\ndoubts arise about this than about our previous conclusions   for the\\npracticability of what is said may be doubted   and looked at in another\\npoint of view   whether the scheme   if ever so practicable   would be for\\nthe best   is also doubtful   hence i feel a reluctance to approach the\\nsubject   lest our aspiration   my dear friend   should turn out to be a\\ndream only  \\n\\nfear not   he replied   for your audience will not be hard upon you   they\\nare not sceptical or hostile  \\n\\ni said   my good friend   i suppose that you mean to encourage me by\\nthese words  \\n\\nyes   he said  \\n\\nthen let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse   the\\nencouragement which you offer would have been all very well had i\\nmyself believed that i knew what i was talking about   to declare the\\ntruth about matters of high interest which a man honours and loves\\namong wise men who love him need occasion no fear or faltering in his\\nmind   but to carry on an argument when you are yourself only a\\nhesitating enquirer   which is my condition   is a dangerous and slippery\\nthing   and the danger is not that i shall be laughed at   of which the\\nfear would be childish     but that i shall miss the truth where i have\\nmost need to be sure of my footing   and drag my friends after me in my\\nfall   and i pray nemesis not to visit upon me the words which i am\\ngoing to utter   for i do indeed believe that to be an involuntary\\nhomicide is a less crime than to be a deceiver about beauty or goodness\\nor justice in the matter of laws   and that is a risk which i would\\nrather run among enemies than among friends   and therefore you do well\\nto encourage me  \\n\\nglaucon laughed and said   well then   socrates   in case you and your\\nargument do us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand of\\nthe homicide   and shall not be held to be a deceiver   take courage then\\nand speak  \\n\\nwell   i said   the law says that when a man is acquitted he is free from\\nguilt   and what holds at law may hold in argument  \\n\\nthen why should you mind  \\n\\nwell   i replied   i suppose that i must retrace my steps and say what i\\nperhaps ought to have said before in the proper place   the part of the\\nmen has been played out   and now properly enough comes the turn of the\\nwomen   of them i will proceed to speak   and the more readily since i am\\ninvited by you  \\n\\nfor men born and educated like our citizens   the only way   in my\\nopinion   of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and use\\nof women and children is to follow the path on which we originally\\nstarted   when we said that the men were to be the guardians and\\nwatchdogs of the herd  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nlet us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be\\nsubject to similar or nearly similar regulations   then we shall see\\nwhether the result accords with our design  \\n\\nwhat do you mean  \\n\\nwhat i mean may be put into the form of a question   i said   are dogs\\ndivided into hes and shes   or do they both share equally in hunting and\\nin keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs   or do we entrust to\\nthe males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks   while we leave\\nthe females at home   under the idea that the bearing and suckling their\\npuppies is labour enough for them  \\n\\nno   he said   they share alike   the only difference between them is that\\nthe males are stronger and the females weaker  \\n\\nbut can you use different animals for the same purpose   unless they are\\nbred and fed in the same way  \\n\\nyou cannot  \\n\\nthen   if women are to have the same duties as men   they must have the\\nsame nurture and education  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthe education which was assigned to the men was music and gymnastic  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthen women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of war  \\nwhich they must practise like the men  \\n\\nthat is the inference   i suppose  \\n\\ni should rather expect   i said   that several of our proposals   if they\\nare carried out   being unusual   may appear ridiculous  \\n\\nno doubt of it  \\n\\nyes   and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women\\nnaked in the palaestra   exercising with the men   especially when they\\nare no longer young   they certainly will not be a vision of beauty   any\\nmore than the enthusiastic old men who in spite of wrinkles and\\nugliness continue to frequent the gymnasia  \\n\\nyes   indeed   he said   according to present notions the proposal would\\nbe thought ridiculous  \\n\\nbut then   i said   as we have determined to speak our minds   we must not\\nfear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this sort of\\ninnovation   how they will talk of women  s attainments both in music and\\ngymnastic   and above all about their wearing armour and riding upon\\nhorseback  \\n\\nvery true   he replied  \\n\\nyet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law   at\\nthe same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be\\nserious   not long ago   as we shall remind them   the hellenes were of\\nthe opinion   which is still generally received among the barbarians  \\nthat the sight of a naked man was ridiculous and improper   and when\\nfirst the cretans and then the lacedaemonians introduced the custom  \\nthe wits of that day might equally have ridiculed the innovation  \\n\\nno doubt  \\n\\nbut when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was far\\nbetter than to cover them up   and the ludicrous effect to the outward\\neye vanished before the better principle which reason asserted   then\\nthe man was perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of his\\nridicule at any other sight but that of folly and vice   or seriously\\ninclines to weigh the beautiful by any other standard but that of the\\ngood  \\n\\nvery true   he replied  \\n\\nfirst   then   whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest  \\nlet us come to an understanding about the nature of woman   is she\\ncapable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men   or\\nnot at all   and is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or\\ncan not share   that will be the best way of commencing the enquiry   and\\nwill probably lead to the fairest conclusion  \\n\\nthat will be much the best way  \\n\\nshall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against\\nourselves   in this manner the adversary  s position will not be\\nundefended  \\n\\nwhy not   he said  \\n\\nthen let us put a speech into the mouths of our opponents   they will\\nsay     socrates and glaucon   no adversary need convict you   for you\\nyourselves   at the first foundation of the state   admitted the\\nprinciple that everybody was to do the one work suited to his own\\nnature     and certainly   if i am not mistaken   such an admission was\\nmade by us     and do not the natures of men and women differ very much\\nindeed     and we shall reply   of course they do   then we shall be asked  \\n  whether the tasks assigned to men and to women should not be\\ndifferent   and such as are agreeable to their different natures    \\ncertainly they should     but if so   have you not fallen into a serious\\ninconsistency in saying that men and women   whose natures are so\\nentirely different   ought to perform the same actions    —what defence\\nwill you make for us   my good sir   against any one who offers these\\nobjections  \\n\\nthat is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly   and i shall\\nand i do beg of you to draw out the case on our side  \\n\\nthese are the objections   glaucon   and there are many others of a like\\nkind   which i foresaw long ago   they made me afraid and reluctant to\\ntake in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women and\\nchildren  \\n\\nby zeus   he said   the problem to be solved is anything but easy  \\n\\nwhy yes   i said   but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth  \\nwhether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into mid ocean   he\\nhas to swim all the same  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand must not we swim and try to reach the shore   we will hope that\\narion  s dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us  \\n\\ni suppose so   he said  \\n\\nwell then   let us see if any way of escape can be found   we\\nacknowledged—did we not   that different natures ought to have different\\npursuits   and that men  s and women  s natures are different   and now\\nwhat are we saying  —that different natures ought to have the same\\npursuits  —this is the inconsistency which is charged upon us  \\n\\nprecisely  \\n\\nverily   glaucon   i said   glorious is the power of the art of\\ncontradiction  \\n\\nwhy do you say so  \\n\\nbecause i think that many a man falls into the practice against his\\nwill   when he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing   just\\nbecause he cannot define and divide   and so know that of which he is\\nspeaking   and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit\\nof contention and not of fair discussion  \\n\\nyes   he replied   such is very often the case   but what has that to do\\nwith us and our argument  \\n\\na great deal   for there is certainly a danger of our getting\\nunintentionally into a verbal opposition  \\n\\nin what way  \\n\\nwhy we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth   that\\ndifferent natures ought to have different pursuits   but we never\\nconsidered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of\\nnature   or why we distinguished them when we assigned different\\npursuits to different natures and the same to the same natures  \\n\\nwhy   no   he said   that was never considered by us  \\n\\ni said   suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the question\\nwhether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and hairy\\nmen   and if this is admitted by us   then   if bald men are cobblers   we\\nshould forbid the hairy men to be cobblers   and conversely  \\n\\nthat would be a jest   he said  \\n\\nyes   i said   a jest   and why   because we never meant when we\\nconstructed the state   that the opposition of natures should extend to\\nevery difference   but only to those differences which affected the\\npursuit in which the individual is engaged   we should have argued   for\\nexample   that a physician and one who is in mind a physician may be\\nsaid to have the same nature  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nwhereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand if   i said   the male and female sex appear to differ in their\\nfitness for any art or pursuit   we should say that such pursuit or art\\nought to be assigned to one or the other of them   but if the difference\\nconsists only in women bearing and men begetting children   this does\\nnot amount to a proof that a woman differs from a man in respect of the\\nsort of education she should receive   and we shall therefore continue\\nto maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same\\npursuits  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nnext   we shall ask our opponent how   in reference to any of the\\npursuits or arts of civic life   the nature of a woman differs from that\\nof a man  \\n\\nthat will be quite fair  \\n\\nand perhaps he   like yourself   will reply that to give a sufficient\\nanswer on the instant is not easy   but after a little reflection there\\nis no difficulty  \\n\\nyes   perhaps  \\n\\nsuppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the argument   and\\nthen we may hope to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the\\nconstitution of women which would affect them in the administration of\\nthe state  \\n\\nby all means  \\n\\nlet us say to him   come now   and we will ask you a question  —when you\\nspoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect   did you mean to\\nsay that one man will acquire a thing easily   another with difficulty  \\na little learning will lead the one to discover a great deal   whereas\\nthe other   after much study and application   no sooner learns than he\\nforgets   or again   did you mean   that the one has a body which is a\\ngood servant to his mind   while the body of the other is a hindrance to\\nhim  —would not these be the sort of differences which distinguish the\\nman gifted by nature from the one who is ungifted  \\n\\nno one will deny that  \\n\\nand can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has\\nnot all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female  \\nneed i waste time in speaking of the art of weaving   and the management\\nof pancakes and preserves   in which womankind does really appear to be\\ngreat   and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things the\\nmost absurd  \\n\\nyou are quite right   he replied   in maintaining the general inferiority\\nof the female sex   although many women are in many things superior to\\nmany men   yet on the whole what you say is true  \\n\\nand if so   my friend   i said   there is no special faculty of\\nadministration in a state which a woman has because she is a woman   or\\nwhich a man has by virtue of his sex   but the gifts of nature are alike\\ndiffused in both   all the pursuits of men are the pursuits of women\\nalso   but in all of them a woman is inferior to a man  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nthen are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on\\nwomen  \\n\\nthat will never do  \\n\\none woman has a gift of healing   another not   one is a musician   and\\nanother has no music in her nature  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises   and\\nanother is unwarlike and hates gymnastics  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand one woman is a philosopher   and another is an enemy of philosophy  \\none has spirit   and another is without spirit  \\n\\nthat is also true  \\n\\nthen one woman will have the temper of a guardian   and another not   was\\nnot the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of\\nthis sort  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nmen and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian   they\\ndiffer only in their comparative strength or weakness  \\n\\nobviously  \\n\\nand those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the\\ncompanions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom\\nthey resemble in capacity and in character  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits  \\n\\nthey ought  \\n\\nthen   as we were saying before   there is nothing unnatural in assigning\\nmusic and gymnastic to the wives of the guardians—to that point we come\\nround again  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nthe law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature   and therefore\\nnot an impossibility or mere aspiration   and the contrary practice  \\nwhich prevails at present   is in reality a violation of nature  \\n\\nthat appears to be true  \\n\\nwe had to consider   first   whether our proposals were possible   and\\nsecondly whether they were the most beneficial  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand the possibility has been acknowledged  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthe very great benefit has next to be established  \\n\\nquite so  \\n\\nyou will admit that the same education which makes a man a good\\nguardian will make a woman a good guardian   for their original nature\\nis the same  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\ni should like to ask you a question  \\n\\nwhat is it  \\n\\nwould you say that all men are equal in excellence   or is one man\\nbetter than another  \\n\\nthe latter  \\n\\nand in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the\\nguardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more\\nperfect men   or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling  \\n\\nwhat a ridiculous question  \\n\\nyou have answered me   i replied   well   and may we not further say that\\nour guardians are the best of our citizens  \\n\\nby far the best  \\n\\nand will not their wives be the best women  \\n\\nyes   by far the best  \\n\\nand can there be anything better for the interests of the state than\\nthat the men and women of a state should be as good as possible  \\n\\nthere can be nothing better  \\n\\nand this is what the arts of music and gymnastic   when present in such\\nmanner as we have described   will accomplish  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nthen we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest\\ndegree beneficial to the state  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthen let the wives of our guardians strip   for their virtue will be\\ntheir robe   and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of\\ntheir country   only in the distribution of labours the lighter are to\\nbe assigned to the women   who are the weaker natures   but in other\\nrespects their duties are to be the same   and as for the man who laughs\\nat naked women exercising their bodies from the best of motives   in his\\nlaughter he is plucking\\n\\n  a fruit of unripe wisdom    \\n\\nand he himself is ignorant of what he is laughing at   or what he is\\nabout  —for that is   and ever will be   the best of sayings   that the\\nuseful is the noble and the hurtful is the base  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nhere   then   is one difficulty in our law about women   which we may say\\nthat we have now escaped   the wave has not swallowed us up alive for\\nenacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their\\npursuits in common   to the utility and also to the possibility of this\\narrangement the consistency of the argument with itself bears witness  \\n\\nyes   that was a mighty wave which you have escaped  \\n\\nyes   i said   but a greater is coming   you will not think much of this\\nwhen you see the next  \\n\\ngo on   let me see  \\n\\nthe law   i said   which is the sequel of this and of all that has\\npreceded   is to the following effect  —  that the wives of our guardians\\nare to be common   and their children are to be common   and no parent is\\nto know his own child   nor any child his parent    \\n\\nyes   he said   that is a much greater wave than the other   and the\\npossibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more\\nquestionable  \\n\\ni do not think   i said   that there can be any dispute about the very\\ngreat utility of having wives and children in common   the possibility\\nis quite another matter   and will be very much disputed  \\n\\ni think that a good many doubts may be raised about both  \\n\\nyou imply that the two questions must be combined   i replied   now i\\nmeant that you should admit the utility   and in this way   as i thought  \\ni should escape from one of them   and then there would remain only the\\npossibility  \\n\\nbut that little attempt is detected   and therefore you will please to\\ngive a defence of both  \\n\\nwell   i said   i submit to my fate   yet grant me a little favour   let me\\nfeast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of\\nfeasting themselves when they are walking alone   for before they have\\ndiscovered any means of effecting their wishes—that is a matter which\\nnever troubles them—they would rather not tire themselves by thinking\\nabout possibilities   but assuming that what they desire is already\\ngranted to them   they proceed with their plan   and delight in detailing\\nwhat they mean to do when their wish has come true—that is a way which\\nthey have of not doing much good to a capacity which was never good for\\nmuch   now i myself am beginning to lose heart   and i should like   with\\nyour permission   to pass over the question of possibility at present  \\nassuming therefore the possibility of the proposal   i shall now proceed\\nto enquire how the rulers will carry out these arrangements   and i\\nshall demonstrate that our plan   if executed   will be of the greatest\\nbenefit to the state and to the guardians   first of all   then   if you\\nhave no objection   i will endeavour with your help to consider the\\nadvantages of the measure   and hereafter the question of possibility  \\n\\ni have no objection   proceed  \\n\\nfirst   i think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be\\nworthy of the name which they bear   there must be willingness to obey\\nin the one and the power of command in the other   the guardians must\\nthemselves obey the laws   and they must also imitate the spirit of them\\nin any details which are entrusted to their care  \\n\\nthat is right   he said  \\n\\nyou   i said   who are their legislator   having selected the men   will\\nnow select the women and give them to them  —they must be as far as\\npossible of like natures with them   and they must live in common houses\\nand meet at common meals   none of them will have anything specially his\\nor her own   they will be together   and will be brought up together   and\\nwill associate at gymnastic exercises   and so they will be drawn by a\\nnecessity of their natures to have intercourse with each\\nother—necessity is not too strong a word   i think  \\n\\nyes   he said  —necessity   not geometrical   but another sort of necessity\\nwhich lovers know   and which is far more convincing and constraining to\\nthe mass of mankind  \\n\\ntrue   i said   and this   glaucon   like all the rest   must proceed after\\nan orderly fashion   in a city of the blessed   licentiousness is an\\nunholy thing which the rulers will forbid  \\n\\nyes   he said   and it ought not to be permitted  \\n\\nthen clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the\\nhighest degree   and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nand how can marriages be made most beneficial  —that is a question which\\ni put to you   because i see in your house dogs for hunting   and of the\\nnobler sort of birds not a few   now   i beseech you   do tell me   have\\nyou ever attended to their pairing and breeding  \\n\\nin what particulars  \\n\\nwhy   in the first place   although they are all of a good sort   are not\\nsome better than others  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand do you breed from them all indifferently   or do you take care to\\nbreed from the best only  \\n\\nfrom the best  \\n\\nand do you take the oldest or the youngest   or only those of ripe age  \\n\\ni choose only those of ripe age  \\n\\nand if care was not taken in the breeding   your dogs and birds would\\ngreatly deteriorate  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand the same of horses and animals in general  \\n\\nundoubtedly  \\n\\ngood heavens   my dear friend   i said   what consummate skill will our\\nrulers need if the same principle holds of the human species  \\n\\ncertainly   the same principle holds   but why does this involve any\\nparticular skill  \\n\\nbecause   i said   our rulers will often have to practise upon the body\\ncorporate with medicines   now you know that when patients do not\\nrequire medicines   but have only to be put under a regimen   the\\ninferior sort of practitioner is deemed to be good enough   but when\\nmedicine has to be given   then the doctor should be more of a man  \\n\\nthat is quite true   he said   but to what are you alluding  \\n\\ni mean   i replied   that our rulers will find a considerable dose of\\nfalsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects   we were\\nsaying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines might be\\nof advantage  \\n\\nand we were very right  \\n\\nand this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the\\nregulations of marriages and births  \\n\\nhow so  \\n\\nwhy   i said   the principle has been already laid down that the best of\\neither sex should be united with the best as often   and the inferior\\nwith the inferior   as seldom as possible   and that they should rear the\\noffspring of the one sort of union   but not of the other   if the flock\\nis to be maintained in first  rate condition   now these goings on must\\nbe a secret which the rulers only know   or there will be a further\\ndanger of our herd   as the guardians may be termed   breaking out into\\nrebellion  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nhad we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring\\ntogether the brides and bridegrooms   and sacrifices will be offered and\\nsuitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets   the number of weddings\\nis a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers   whose\\naim will be to preserve the average of population   there are many other\\nthings which they will have to consider   such as the effects of wars\\nand diseases and any similar agencies   in order as far as this is\\npossible to prevent the state from becoming either too large or too\\nsmall  \\n\\ncertainly   he replied  \\n\\nwe shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less\\nworthy may draw on each occasion of our bringing them together   and\\nthen they will accuse their own ill  luck and not the rulers  \\n\\nto be sure   he said  \\n\\nand i think that our braver and better youth   besides their other\\nhonours and rewards   might have greater facilities of intercourse with\\nwomen given them   their bravery will be a reason   and such fathers\\nought to have as many sons as possible  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand the proper officers   whether male or female or both   for offices\\nare to be held by women as well as by men—\\n\\nyes—\\n\\nthe proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the\\npen or fold   and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who\\ndwell in a separate quarter   but the offspring of the inferior   or of\\nthe better when they chance to be deformed   will be put away in some\\nmysterious   unknown place   as they should be  \\n\\nyes   he said   that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to be\\nkept pure  \\n\\nthey will provide for their nurture   and will bring the mothers to the\\nfold when they are full of milk   taking the greatest possible care that\\nno mother recognises her own child   and other wet  nurses may be engaged\\nif more are required   care will also be taken that the process of\\nsuckling shall not be protracted too long   and the mothers will have no\\ngetting up at night or other trouble   but will hand over all this sort\\nof thing to the nurses and attendants  \\n\\nyou suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of it\\nwhen they are having children  \\n\\nwhy   said i   and so they ought   let us   however   proceed with our\\nscheme   we were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand what is the prime of life   may it not be defined as a period of\\nabout twenty years in a woman  s life   and thirty in a man  s  \\n\\nwhich years do you mean to include  \\n\\na woman   i said   at twenty years of age may begin to bear children to\\nthe state   and continue to bear them until forty   a man may begin at\\nfive  and  twenty   when he has passed the point at which the pulse of\\nlife beats quickest   and continue to beget children until he be\\nfifty  five  \\n\\ncertainly   he said   both in men and women those years are the prime of\\nphysical as well as of intellectual vigour  \\n\\nany one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the public\\nhymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing  \\nthe child of which he is the father   if it steals into life   will have\\nbeen conceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and prayers  \\nwhich at each hymeneal priestesses and priest and the whole city will\\noffer   that the new generation may be better and more useful than their\\ngood and useful parents   whereas his child will be the offspring of\\ndarkness and strange lust  \\n\\nvery true   he replied  \\n\\nand the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed\\nage who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without\\nthe sanction of the rulers   for we shall say that he is raising up a\\nbastard to the state   uncertified and unconsecrated  \\n\\nvery true   he replied  \\n\\nthis applies   however   only to those who are within the specified age  \\nafter that we allow them to range at will   except that a man may not\\nmarry his daughter or his daughter  s daughter   or his mother or his\\nmother  s mother   and women   on the other hand   are prohibited from\\nmarrying their sons or fathers   or son  s son or father  s father   and so\\non in either direction   and we grant all this   accompanying the\\npermission with strict orders to prevent any embryo which may come into\\nbeing from seeing the light   and if any force a way to the birth   the\\nparents must understand that the offspring of such an union cannot be\\nmaintained   and arrange accordingly  \\n\\nthat also   he said   is a reasonable proposition   but how will they know\\nwho are fathers and daughters   and so on  \\n\\nthey will never know   the way will be this  —dating from the day of the\\nhymeneal   the bridegroom who was then married will call all the male\\nchildren who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards his\\nsons   and the female children his daughters   and they will call him\\nfather   and he will call their children his grandchildren   and they\\nwill call the elder generation grandfathers and grandmothers   all who\\nwere begotten at the time when their fathers and mothers came together\\nwill be called their brothers and sisters   and these   as i was saying  \\nwill be forbidden to inter  marry   this   however   is not to be\\nunderstood as an absolute prohibition of the marriage of brothers and\\nsisters   if the lot favours them   and they receive the sanction of the\\npythian oracle   the law will allow them  \\n\\nquite right   he replied  \\n\\nsuch is the scheme   glaucon   according to which the guardians of our\\nstate are to have their wives and families in common   and now you would\\nhave the argument show that this community is consistent with the rest\\nof our polity   and also that nothing can be better—would you not  \\n\\nyes   certainly  \\n\\nshall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought\\nto be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the\\norganization of a state  —what is the greatest good   and what is the\\ngreatest evil   and then consider whether our previous description has\\nthe stamp of the good or of the evil  \\n\\nby all means  \\n\\ncan there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and\\nplurality where unity ought to reign   or any greater good than the bond\\nof unity  \\n\\nthere cannot  \\n\\nand there is unity where there is community of pleasures and\\npains—where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions\\nof joy and sorrow  \\n\\nno doubt  \\n\\nyes   and where there is no common but only private feeling a state is\\ndisorganized—when you have one half of the world triumphing and the\\nother plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the\\ncitizens  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nsuch differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use of\\nthe terms   mine   and   not mine       his   and   not his    \\n\\nexactly so  \\n\\nand is not that the best  ordered state in which the greatest number of\\npersons apply the terms   mine   and   not mine   in the same way to the\\nsame thing  \\n\\nquite true  \\n\\nor that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the\\nindividual—as in the body   when but a finger of one of us is hurt   the\\nwhole frame   drawn towards the soul as a centre and forming one kingdom\\nunder the ruling power therein   feels the hurt and sympathizes all\\ntogether with the part affected   and we say that the man has a pain in\\nhis finger   and the same expression is used about any other part of the\\nbody   which has a sensation of pain at suffering or of pleasure at the\\nalleviation of suffering  \\n\\nvery true   he replied   and i agree with you that in the best  ordered\\nstate there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you\\ndescribe  \\n\\nthen when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil   the\\nwhole state will make his case their own   and will either rejoice or\\nsorrow with him  \\n\\nyes   he said   that is what will happen in a well  ordered state  \\n\\nit will now be time   i said   for us to return to our state and see\\nwhether this or some other form is most in accordance with these\\nfundamental principles  \\n\\nvery good  \\n\\nour state like every other has rulers and subjects  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nall of whom will call one another citizens  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nbut is there not another name which people give to their rulers in\\nother states  \\n\\ngenerally they call them masters   but in democratic states they simply\\ncall them rulers  \\n\\nand in our state what other name besides that of citizens do the people\\ngive the rulers  \\n\\nthey are called saviours and helpers   he replied  \\n\\nand what do the rulers call the people  \\n\\ntheir maintainers and foster  fathers  \\n\\nand what do they call them in other states  \\n\\nslaves  \\n\\nand what do the rulers call one another in other states  \\n\\nfellow  rulers  \\n\\nand what in ours  \\n\\nfellow  guardians  \\n\\ndid you ever know an example in any other state of a ruler who would\\nspeak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not\\nbeing his friend  \\n\\nyes   very often  \\n\\nand the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an\\ninterest   and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nbut would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as\\na stranger  \\n\\ncertainly he would not   for every one whom they meet will be regarded\\nby them either as a brother or sister   or father or mother   or son or\\ndaughter   or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected\\nwith him  \\n\\ncapital   i said   but let me ask you once more   shall they be a family\\nin name only   or shall they in all their actions be true to the name  \\nfor example   in the use of the word   father     would the care of a\\nfather be implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to\\nhim which the law commands   and is the violator of these duties to be\\nregarded as an impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to\\nreceive much good either at the hands of god or of man   are these to be\\nor not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated in their\\nears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to them to be\\ntheir parents and the rest of their kinsfolk  \\n\\nthese   he said   and none other   for what can be more ridiculous than\\nfor them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not\\nto act in the spirit of them  \\n\\nthen in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often\\nheard than in any other   as i was describing before   when any one is\\nwell or ill   the universal word will be   with me it is well   or   it is\\nill    \\n\\nmost true  \\n\\nand agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking   were we not saying\\nthat they will have their pleasures and pains in common  \\n\\nyes   and so they will  \\n\\nand they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will\\nalike call   my own     and having this common interest they will have a\\ncommon feeling of pleasure and pain  \\n\\nyes   far more so than in other states  \\n\\nand the reason of this   over and above the general constitution of the\\nstate   will be that the guardians will have a community of women and\\nchildren  \\n\\nthat will be the chief reason  \\n\\nand this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good   as was\\nimplied in our own comparison of a well  ordered state to the relation\\nof the body and the members   when affected by pleasure or pain  \\n\\nthat we acknowledged   and very rightly  \\n\\nthen the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly\\nthe source of the greatest good to the state  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand this agrees with the other principle which we were affirming  —that\\nthe guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other property  \\ntheir pay was to be their food   which they were to receive from the\\nother citizens   and they were to have no private expenses   for we\\nintended them to preserve their true character of guardians  \\n\\nright   he replied  \\n\\nboth the community of property and the community of families   as i am\\nsaying   tend to make them more truly guardians   they will not tear the\\ncity in pieces by differing about   mine   and   not mine     each man\\ndragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his\\nown   where he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures\\nand pains   but all will be affected as far as may be by the same\\npleasures and pains because they are all of one opinion about what is\\nnear and dear to them   and therefore they all tend towards a common\\nend  \\n\\ncertainly   he replied  \\n\\nand as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their\\nown   suits and complaints will have no existence among them   they will\\nbe delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or\\nrelations are the occasion  \\n\\nof course they will  \\n\\nneither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur among\\nthem   for that equals should defend themselves against equals we shall\\nmaintain to be honourable and right   we shall make the protection of\\nthe person a matter of necessity  \\n\\nthat is good   he said  \\n\\nyes   and there is a further good in the law   viz   that if a man has a\\nquarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there   and\\nnot proceed to more dangerous lengths  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nto the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the\\nyounger  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nnor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any\\nother violence to an elder   unless the magistrates command him   nor\\nwill he slight him in any way   for there are two guardians   shame and\\nfear   mighty to prevent him   shame   which makes men refrain from laying\\nhands on those who are to them in the relation of parents   fear   that\\nthe injured one will be succoured by the others who are his brothers  \\nsons   fathers  \\n\\nthat is true   he replied  \\n\\nthen in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace\\nwith one another  \\n\\nyes   there will be no want of peace  \\n\\nand as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will be\\nno danger of the rest of the city being divided either against them or\\nagainst one another  \\n\\nnone whatever  \\n\\ni hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they will\\nbe rid   for they are beneath notice   such   for example   as the flattery\\nof the rich by the poor   and all the pains and pangs which men\\nexperience in bringing up a family   and in finding money to buy\\nnecessaries for their household   borrowing and then repudiating  \\ngetting how they can   and giving the money into the hands of women and\\nslaves to keep—the many evils of so many kinds which people suffer in\\nthis way are mean enough and obvious enough   and not worth speaking of  \\n\\nyes   he said   a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive that  \\n\\nand from all these evils they will be delivered   and their life will be\\nblessed as the life of olympic victors and yet more blessed  \\n\\nhow so  \\n\\nthe olympic victor   i said   is deemed happy in receiving a part only of\\nthe blessedness which is secured to our citizens   who have won a more\\nglorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the public\\ncost   for the victory which they have won is the salvation of the whole\\nstate   and the crown with which they and their children are crowned is\\nthe fulness of all that life needs   they receive rewards from the hands\\nof their country while living   and after death have an honourable\\nburial  \\n\\nyes   he said   and glorious rewards they are  \\n\\ndo you remember   i said   how in the course of the previous discussion\\nsome one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians\\nunhappy—they had nothing and might have possessed all things—to whom we\\nreplied that   if an occasion offered   we might perhaps hereafter\\nconsider this question   but that   as at present advised   we would make\\nour guardians truly guardians   and that we were fashioning the state\\nwith a view to the greatest happiness   not of any particular class   but\\nof the whole  \\n\\nyes   i remember  \\n\\nand what do you say   now that the life of our protectors is made out to\\nbe far better and nobler than that of olympic victors—is the life of\\nshoemakers   or any other artisans   or of husbandmen   to be compared\\nwith it  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nat the same time i ought here to repeat what i have said elsewhere  \\nthat if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner\\nthat he will cease to be a guardian   and is not content with this safe\\nand harmonious life   which   in our judgment   is of all lives the best  \\nbut infatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into\\nhis head shall seek to appropriate the whole state to himself   then he\\nwill have to learn how wisely hesiod spoke   when he said     half is more\\nthan the whole    \\n\\nif he were to consult me   i should say to him   stay where you are   when\\nyou have the offer of such a life  \\n\\nyou agree then   i said   that men and women are to have a common way of\\nlife such as we have described—common education   common children   and\\nthey are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the\\ncity or going out to war   they are to keep watch together   and to hunt\\ntogether like dogs   and always and in all things   as far as they are\\nable   women are to share with the men   and in so doing they will do\\nwhat is best   and will not violate   but preserve the natural relation\\nof the sexes  \\n\\ni agree with you   he replied  \\n\\nthe enquiry   i said   has yet to be made   whether such a community be\\nfound possible—as among other animals   so also among men—and if\\npossible   in what way possible  \\n\\nyou have anticipated the question which i was about to suggest  \\n\\nthere is no difficulty   i said   in seeing how war will be carried on by\\nthem  \\n\\nhow  \\n\\nwhy   of course they will go on expeditions together   and will take with\\nthem any of their children who are strong enough   that   after the\\nmanner of the artisan  s child   they may look on at the work which they\\nwill have to do when they are grown up   and besides looking on they\\nwill have to help and be of use in war   and to wait upon their fathers\\nand mothers   did you never observe in the arts how the potters   boys\\nlook on and help   long before they touch the wheel  \\n\\nyes   i have  \\n\\nand shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in\\ngiving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than\\nour guardians will be  \\n\\nthe idea is ridiculous   he said  \\n\\nthere is also the effect on the parents   with whom   as with other\\nanimals   the presence of their young ones will be the greatest\\nincentive to valour  \\n\\nthat is quite true   socrates   and yet if they are defeated   which may\\noften happen in war   how great the danger is   the children will be lost\\nas well as their parents   and the state will never recover  \\n\\ntrue   i said   but would you never allow them to run any risk  \\n\\ni am far from saying that  \\n\\nwell   but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some\\noccasion when   if they escape disaster   they will be the better for it  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nwhether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of their\\nyouth is a very important matter   for the sake of which some risk may\\nfairly be incurred  \\n\\nyes   very important  \\n\\nthis then must be our first step  —to make our children spectators of\\nwar   but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against\\ndanger   then all will be well  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\ntheir parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war   but\\nto know   as far as human foresight can   what expeditions are safe and\\nwhat dangerous  \\n\\nthat may be assumed  \\n\\nand they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about\\nthe dangerous ones  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who\\nwill be their leaders and teachers  \\n\\nvery properly  \\n\\nstill   the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen   there is a good\\ndeal of chance about them  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthen against such chances the children must be at once furnished with\\nwings   in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape  \\n\\nwhat do you mean   he said  \\n\\ni mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth   and\\nwhen they have learnt to ride   take them on horseback to see war   the\\nhorses must not be spirited and warlike   but the most tractable and yet\\nthe swiftest that can be had   in this way they will get an excellent\\nview of what is hereafter to be their own business   and if there is\\ndanger they have only to follow their elder leaders and escape  \\n\\ni believe that you are right   he said  \\n\\nnext   as to war   what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one\\nanother and to their enemies   i should be inclined to propose that the\\nsoldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms   or is guilty of\\nany other act of cowardice   should be degraded into the rank of a\\nhusbandman or artisan   what do you think  \\n\\nby all means   i should say  \\n\\nand he who allows himself to be taken prisoner may as well be made a\\npresent of to his enemies   he is their lawful prey   and let them do\\nwhat they like with him  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nbut the hero who has distinguished himself   what shall be done to him  \\nin the first place   he shall receive honour in the army from his\\nyouthful comrades   every one of them in succession shall crown him  \\nwhat do you say  \\n\\ni approve  \\n\\nand what do you say to his receiving the right hand of fellowship  \\n\\nto that too   i agree  \\n\\nbut you will hardly agree to my next proposal  \\n\\nwhat is your proposal  \\n\\nthat he should kiss and be kissed by them  \\n\\nmost certainly   and i should be disposed to go further   and say   let no\\none whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while the\\nexpedition lasts   so that if there be a lover in the army   whether his\\nlove be youth or maiden   he may be more eager to win the prize of\\nvalour  \\n\\ncapital   i said   that the brave man is to have more wives than others\\nhas been already determined   and he is to have first choices in such\\nmatters more than others   in order that he may have as many children as\\npossible  \\n\\nagreed  \\n\\nagain   there is another manner in which   according to homer   brave\\nyouths should be honoured   for he tells how ajax   after he had\\ndistinguished himself in battle   was rewarded with long chines   which\\nseems to be a compliment appropriate to a hero in the flower of his\\nage   being not only a tribute of honour but also a very strengthening\\nthing  \\n\\nmost true   he said  \\n\\nthen in this   i said   homer shall be our teacher   and we too   at\\nsacrifices and on the like occasions   will honour the brave according\\nto the measure of their valour   whether men or women   with hymns and\\nthose other distinctions which we were mentioning   also with\\n\\n  seats of precedence   and meats and full cups    \\n\\nand in honouring them   we shall be at the same time training them  \\n\\nthat   he replied   is excellent  \\n\\nyes   i said   and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say   in\\nthe first place   that he is of the golden race  \\n\\nto be sure  \\n\\nnay   have we not the authority of hesiod for affirming that when they\\nare dead\\n\\n  they are holy angels upon the earth   authors of good   averters of\\nevil   the guardians of speech  gifted men    \\n\\nyes   and we accept his authority  \\n\\nwe must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine\\nand heroic personages   and what is to be their special distinction   and\\nwe must do as he bids  \\n\\nby all means  \\n\\nand in ages to come we will reverence them and kneel before their\\nsepulchres as at the graves of heroes   and not only they but any who\\nare deemed pre  eminently good   whether they die from age   or in any\\nother way   shall be admitted to the same honours  \\n\\nthat is very right   he said  \\n\\nnext   how shall our soldiers treat their enemies   what about this  \\n\\nin what respect do you mean  \\n\\nfirst of all   in regard to slavery   do you think it right that hellenes\\nshould enslave hellenic states   or allow others to enslave them   if\\nthey can help   should not their custom be to spare them   considering\\nthe danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under\\nthe yoke of the barbarians  \\n\\nto spare them is infinitely better  \\n\\nthen no hellene should be owned by them as a slave   that is a rule\\nwhich they will observe and advise the other hellenes to observe  \\n\\ncertainly   he said   they will in this way be united against the\\nbarbarians and will keep their hands off one another  \\n\\nnext as to the slain   ought the conquerors   i said   to take anything\\nbut their armour   does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford\\nan excuse for not facing the battle   cowards skulk about the dead  \\npretending that they are fulfilling a duty   and many an army before now\\nhas been lost from this love of plunder  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse   and also\\na degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead\\nbody when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting gear\\nbehind him  —is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at his\\nassailant   quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead  \\n\\nvery like a dog   he said  \\n\\nthen we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial  \\n\\nyes   he replied   we most certainly must  \\n\\nneither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods   least of all\\nthe arms of hellenes   if we care to maintain good feeling with other\\nhellenes   and   indeed   we have reason to fear that the offering of\\nspoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the\\ngod himself  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nagain   as to the devastation of hellenic territory or the burning of\\nhouses   what is to be the practice  \\n\\nmay i have the pleasure   he said   of hearing your opinion  \\n\\nboth should be forbidden   in my judgment   i would take the annual\\nproduce and no more   shall i tell you why  \\n\\npray do  \\n\\nwhy   you see   there is a difference in the names   discord   and   war    \\nand i imagine that there is also a difference in their natures   the one\\nis expressive of what is internal and domestic   the other of what is\\nexternal and foreign   and the first of the two is termed discord   and\\nonly the second   war  \\n\\nthat is a very proper distinction   he replied  \\n\\nand may i not observe with equal propriety that the hellenic race is\\nall united together by ties of blood and friendship   and alien and\\nstrange to the barbarians  \\n\\nvery good   he said  \\n\\nand therefore when hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with\\nhellenes   they will be described by us as being at war when they fight  \\nand by nature enemies   and this kind of antagonism should be called\\nwar   but when hellenes fight with one another we shall say that hellas\\nis then in a state of disorder and discord   they being by nature\\nfriends   and such enmity is to be called discord  \\n\\ni agree  \\n\\nconsider then   i said   when that which we have acknowledged to be\\ndiscord occurs   and a city is divided   if both parties destroy the\\nlands and burn the houses of one another   how wicked does the strife\\nappear   no true lover of his country would bring himself to tear in\\npieces his own nurse and mother   there might be reason in the conqueror\\ndepriving the conquered of their harvest   but still they would have the\\nidea of peace in their hearts and would not mean to go on fighting for\\never  \\n\\nyes   he said   that is a better temper than the other  \\n\\nand will not the city   which you are founding   be an hellenic city  \\n\\nit ought to be   he replied  \\n\\nthen will not the citizens be good and civilized  \\n\\nyes   very civilized  \\n\\nand will they not be lovers of hellas   and think of hellas as their own\\nland   and share in the common temples  \\n\\nmost certainly  \\n\\nand any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them as\\ndiscord only—a quarrel among friends   which is not to be called a war  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nthen they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nthey will use friendly correction   but will not enslave or destroy\\ntheir opponents   they will be correctors   not enemies  \\n\\njust so  \\n\\nand as they are hellenes themselves they will not devastate hellas   nor\\nwill they burn houses   nor ever suppose that the whole population of a\\ncity—men   women   and children—are equally their enemies   for they know\\nthat the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and that the\\nmany are their friends   and for all these reasons they will be\\nunwilling to waste their lands and rase their houses   their enmity to\\nthem will only last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled\\nthe guilty few to give satisfaction  \\n\\ni agree   he said   that our citizens should thus deal with their\\nhellenic enemies   and with barbarians as the hellenes now deal with one\\nanother  \\n\\nthen let us enact this law also for our guardians  —that they are\\nneither to devastate the lands of hellenes nor to burn their houses  \\n\\nagreed   and we may agree also in thinking that these   like all our\\nprevious enactments   are very good  \\n\\nbut still i must say   socrates   that if you are allowed to go on in\\nthis way you will entirely forget the other question which at the\\ncommencement of this discussion you thrust aside  —is such an order of\\nthings possible   and how   if at all   for i am quite ready to\\nacknowledge that the plan which you propose   if only feasible   would do\\nall sorts of good to the state   i will add   what you have omitted   that\\nyour citizens will be the bravest of warriors   and will never leave\\ntheir ranks   for they will all know one another   and each will call the\\nother father   brother   son   and if you suppose the women to join their\\narmies   whether in the same rank or in the rear   either as a terror to\\nthe enemy   or as auxiliaries in case of need   i know that they will\\nthen be absolutely invincible   and there are many domestic advantages\\nwhich might also be mentioned and which i also fully acknowledge   but  \\nas i admit all these advantages and as many more as you please   if only\\nthis state of yours were to come into existence   we need say no more\\nabout them   assuming then the existence of the state   let us now turn\\nto the question of possibility and ways and means—the rest may be left  \\n\\nif i loiter for a moment   you instantly make a raid upon me   i said  \\nand have no mercy   i have hardly escaped the first and second waves  \\nand you seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the\\nthird   which is the greatest and heaviest   when you have seen and heard\\nthe third wave   i think you will be more considerate and will\\nacknowledge that some fear and hesitation was natural respecting a\\nproposal so extraordinary as that which i have now to state and\\ninvestigate  \\n\\nthe more appeals of this sort which you make   he said   the more\\ndetermined are we that you shall tell us how such a state is possible  \\nspeak out and at once  \\n\\nlet me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the\\nsearch after justice and injustice  \\n\\ntrue   he replied   but what of that  \\n\\ni was only going to ask whether   if we have discovered them   we are to\\nrequire that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice  \\nor may we be satisfied with an approximation   and the attainment in him\\nof a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men  \\n\\nthe approximation will be enough  \\n\\nwe were enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the\\ncharacter of the perfectly just   and into injustice and the perfectly\\nunjust   that we might have an ideal   we were to look at these in order\\nthat we might judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according to\\nthe standard which they exhibited and the degree in which we resembled\\nthem   but not with any view of showing that they could exist in fact  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nwould a painter be any the worse because   after having delineated with\\nconsummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man   he was unable to\\nshow that any such man could ever have existed  \\n\\nhe would be none the worse  \\n\\nwell   and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect state  \\n\\nto be sure  \\n\\nand is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the\\npossibility of a city being ordered in the manner described  \\n\\nsurely not   he replied  \\n\\nthat is the truth   i said   but if   at your request   i am to try and\\nshow how and under what conditions the possibility is highest   i must\\nask you   having this in view   to repeat your former admissions  \\n\\nwhat admissions  \\n\\ni want to know whether ideals are ever fully realized in language   does\\nnot the word express more than the fact   and must not the actual  \\nwhatever a man may think   always   in the nature of things   fall short\\nof the truth   what do you say  \\n\\ni agree  \\n\\nthen you must not insist on my proving that the actual state will in\\nevery respect coincide with the ideal   if we are only able to discover\\nhow a city may be governed nearly as we proposed   you will admit that\\nwe have discovered the possibility which you demand   and will be\\ncontented   i am sure that i should be contented—will not you  \\n\\nyes   i will  \\n\\nlet me next endeavour to show what is that fault in states which is the\\ncause of their present maladministration   and what is the least change\\nwhich will enable a state to pass into the truer form   and let the\\nchange   if possible   be of one thing only   or   if not   of two   at any\\nrate   let the changes be as few and slight as possible  \\n\\ncertainly   he replied  \\n\\ni think   i said   that there might be a reform of the state if only one\\nchange were made   which is not a slight or easy though still a possible\\none  \\n\\nwhat is it   he said  \\n\\nnow then   i said   i go to meet that which i liken to the greatest of\\nthe waves   yet shall the word be spoken   even though the wave break and\\ndrown me in laughter and dishonour   and do you mark my words  \\n\\nproceed  \\n\\ni said     until philosophers are kings   or the kings and princes of this\\nworld have the spirit and power of philosophy   and political greatness\\nand wisdom meet in one   and those commoner natures who pursue either to\\nthe exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside   cities will\\nnever have rest from their evils  —nor the human race   as i believe  —and\\nthen only will this our state have a possibility of life and behold the\\nlight of day     such was the thought   my dear glaucon   which i would\\nfain have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant   for to be\\nconvinced that in no other state can there be happiness private or\\npublic is indeed a hard thing  \\n\\nsocrates   what do you mean   i would have you consider that the word\\nwhich you have uttered is one at which numerous persons   and very\\nrespectable persons too   in a figure pulling off their coats all in a\\nmoment   and seizing any weapon that comes to hand   will run at you\\nmight and main   before you know where you are   intending to do heaven\\nknows what   and if you don  t prepare an answer   and put yourself in\\nmotion   you will be   pared by their fine wits     and no mistake  \\n\\nyou got me into the scrape   i said  \\n\\nand i was quite right   however   i will do all i can to get you out of\\nit   but i can only give you good  will and good advice   and   perhaps   i\\nmay be able to fit answers to your questions better than another—that\\nis all   and now   having such an auxiliary   you must do your best to\\nshow the unbelievers that you are right  \\n\\ni ought to try   i said   since you offer me such invaluable assistance  \\nand i think that   if there is to be a chance of our escaping   we must\\nexplain to them whom we mean when we say that philosophers are to rule\\nin the state   then we shall be able to defend ourselves   there will be\\ndiscovered to be some natures who ought to study philosophy and to be\\nleaders in the state   and others who are not born to be philosophers  \\nand are meant to be followers rather than leaders  \\n\\nthen now for a definition   he said  \\n\\nfollow me   i said   and i hope that i may in some way or other be able\\nto give you a satisfactory explanation  \\n\\nproceed  \\n\\ni dare say that you remember   and therefore i need not remind you   that\\na lover   if he is worthy of the name   ought to show his love   not to\\nsome one part of that which he loves   but to the whole  \\n\\ni really do not understand   and therefore beg of you to assist my\\nmemory  \\n\\nanother person   i said   might fairly reply as you do   but a man of\\npleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower of\\nyouth do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a lover  s breast  \\nand are thought by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards   is not\\nthis a way which you have with the fair   one has a snub nose   and you\\npraise his charming face   the hook  nose of another has   you say   a\\nroyal look   while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the grace of\\nregularity   the dark visage is manly   the fair are children of the\\ngods   and as to the sweet   honey pale     as they are called   what is the\\nvery name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives   and is\\nnot averse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth   in a word  \\nthere is no excuse which you will not make   and nothing which you will\\nnot say   in order not to lose a single flower that blooms in the\\nspring  time of youth  \\n\\nif you make me an authority in matters of love   for the sake of the\\nargument   i assent  \\n\\nand what do you say of lovers of wine   do you not see them doing the\\nsame   they are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine  \\n\\nvery good  \\n\\nand the same is true of ambitious men   if they cannot command an army  \\nthey are willing to command a file   and if they cannot be honoured by\\nreally great and important persons   they are glad to be honoured by\\nlesser and meaner people  —but honour of some kind they must have  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nonce more let me ask   does he who desires any class of goods   desire\\nthe whole class or a part only  \\n\\nthe whole  \\n\\nand may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover   not of a part\\nof wisdom only   but of the whole  \\n\\nyes   of the whole  \\n\\nand he who dislikes learning   especially in youth   when he has no power\\nof judging what is good and what is not   such an one we maintain not to\\nbe a philosopher or a lover of knowledge   just as he who refuses his\\nfood is not hungry   and may be said to have a bad appetite and not a\\ngood one  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nwhereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is\\ncurious to learn and is never satisfied   may be justly termed a\\nphilosopher   am i not right  \\n\\nglaucon said   if curiosity makes a philosopher   you will find many a\\nstrange being will have a title to the name   all the lovers of sights\\nhave a delight in learning   and must therefore be included   musical\\namateurs   too   are a folk strangely out of place among philosophers  \\nfor they are the last persons in the world who would come to anything\\nlike a philosophical discussion   if they could help   while they run\\nabout at the dionysiac festivals as if they had let out their ears to\\nhear every chorus   whether the performance is in town or country—that\\nmakes no difference—they are there   now are we to maintain that all\\nthese and any who have similar tastes   as well as the professors of\\nquite minor arts   are philosophers  \\n\\ncertainly not   i replied   they are only an imitation  \\n\\nhe said   who then are the true philosophers  \\n\\nthose   i said   who are lovers of the vision of truth  \\n\\nthat is also good   he said   but i should like to know what you mean  \\n\\nto another   i replied   i might have a difficulty in explaining   but i\\nam sure that you will admit a proposition which i am about to make  \\n\\nwhat is the proposition  \\n\\nthat since beauty is the opposite of ugliness   they are two  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand inasmuch as they are two   each of them is one  \\n\\ntrue again  \\n\\nand of just and unjust   good and evil   and of every other class   the\\nsame remark holds   taken singly   each of them is one   but from the\\nvarious combinations of them with actions and things and with one\\nanother   they are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand this is the distinction which i draw between the sight  loving  \\nart  loving   practical class and those of whom i am speaking   and who\\nare alone worthy of the name of philosophers  \\n\\nhow do you distinguish them   he said  \\n\\nthe lovers of sounds and sights   i replied   are   as i conceive   fond of\\nfine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products that\\nare made out of them   but their mind is incapable of seeing or loving\\nabsolute beauty  \\n\\ntrue   he replied  \\n\\nfew are they who are able to attain to the sight of this  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand he who   having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute\\nbeauty   or who   if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is\\nunable to follow—of such an one i ask   is he awake or in a dream only  \\nreflect   is not the dreamer   sleeping or waking   one who likens\\ndissimilar things   who puts the copy in the place of the real object  \\n\\ni should certainly say that such an one was dreaming  \\n\\nbut take the case of the other   who recognises the existence of\\nabsolute beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects\\nwhich participate in the idea   neither putting the objects in the place\\nof the idea nor the idea in the place of the objects—is he a dreamer  \\nor is he awake  \\n\\nhe is wide awake  \\n\\nand may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge  \\nand that the mind of the other   who opines only   has opinion  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nbut suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our\\nstatement   can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him  \\nwithout revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits  \\n\\nwe must certainly offer him some good advice   he replied  \\n\\ncome   then   and let us think of something to say to him   shall we begin\\nby assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have  \\nand that we are rejoiced at his having it   but we should like to ask\\nhim a question   does he who has knowledge know something or nothing  \\n  you must answer for him    \\n\\ni answer that he knows something  \\n\\nsomething that is or is not  \\n\\nsomething that is   for how can that which is not ever be known  \\n\\nand are we assured   after looking at the matter from many points of\\nview   that absolute being is or may be absolutely known   but that the\\nutterly non  existent is utterly unknown  \\n\\nnothing can be more certain  \\n\\ngood   but if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and\\nnot to be   that will have a place intermediate between pure being and\\nthe absolute negation of being  \\n\\nyes   between them  \\n\\nand   as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to\\nnot  being   for that intermediate between being and not  being there has\\nto be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and\\nknowledge   if there be such  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\ndo we admit the existence of opinion  \\n\\nundoubtedly  \\n\\nas being the same with knowledge   or another faculty  \\n\\nanother faculty  \\n\\nthen opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter\\ncorresponding to this difference of faculties  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand knowledge is relative to being and knows being   but before i\\nproceed further i will make a division  \\n\\nwhat division  \\n\\ni will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves   they are\\npowers in us   and in all other things   by which we do as we do   sight\\nand hearing   for example   i should call faculties   have i clearly\\nexplained the class which i mean  \\n\\nyes   i quite understand  \\n\\nthen let me tell you my view about them   i do not see them   and\\ntherefore the distinctions of figure   colour   and the like   which\\nenable me to discern the differences of some things   do not apply to\\nthem   in speaking of a faculty i think only of its sphere and its\\nresult   and that which has the same sphere and the same result i call\\nthe same faculty   but that which has another sphere and another result\\ni call different   would that be your way of speaking  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand will you be so very good as to answer one more question   would you\\nsay that knowledge is a faculty   or in what class would you place it  \\n\\ncertainly knowledge is a faculty   and the mightiest of all faculties  \\n\\nand is opinion also a faculty  \\n\\ncertainly   he said   for opinion is that with which we are able to form\\nan opinion  \\n\\nand yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not\\nthe same as opinion  \\n\\nwhy   yes   he said   how can any reasonable being ever identify that\\nwhich is infallible with that which errs  \\n\\nan excellent answer   proving   i said   that we are quite conscious of a\\ndistinction between them  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthen knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct\\nspheres or subject  matters  \\n\\nthat is certain  \\n\\nbeing is the sphere or subject  matter of knowledge   and knowledge is to\\nknow the nature of being  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand opinion is to have an opinion  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand do we know what we opine   or is the subject  matter of opinion the\\nsame as the subject  matter of knowledge  \\n\\nnay   he replied   that has been already disproven   if difference in\\nfaculty implies difference in the sphere or subject  matter   and if   as\\nwe were saying   opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties   then the\\nsphere of knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same  \\n\\nthen if being is the subject  matter of knowledge   something else must\\nbe the subject  matter of opinion  \\n\\nyes   something else  \\n\\nwell then   is not  being the subject  matter of opinion   or   rather   how\\ncan there be an opinion at all about not  being   reflect   when a man has\\nan opinion   has he not an opinion about something   can he have an\\nopinion which is an opinion about nothing  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nhe who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand not  being is not one thing but   properly speaking   nothing  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nof not  being   ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative   of\\nbeing   knowledge  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nthen opinion is not concerned either with being or with not  being  \\n\\nnot with either  \\n\\nand can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge  \\n\\nthat seems to be true  \\n\\nbut is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them   in a\\ngreater clearness than knowledge   or in a greater darkness than\\nignorance  \\n\\nin neither  \\n\\nthen i suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge  \\nbut lighter than ignorance  \\n\\nboth   and in no small degree  \\n\\nand also to be within and between them  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthen you would infer that opinion is intermediate  \\n\\nno question  \\n\\nbut were we not saying before   that if anything appeared to be of a\\nsort which is and is not at the same time   that sort of thing would\\nappear also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute\\nnot  being   and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor\\nignorance   but will be found in the interval between them  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand in that interval there has now been discovered something which we\\ncall opinion  \\n\\nthere has  \\n\\nthen what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally\\nof the nature of being and not  being   and cannot rightly be termed\\neither   pure and simple   this unknown term   when discovered   we may\\ntruly call the subject of opinion   and assign each to their proper\\nfaculty  —the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to\\nthe faculty of the mean  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthis being premised   i would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that\\nthere is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty—in whose opinion\\nthe beautiful is the manifold—he   i say   your lover of beautiful\\nsights   who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one   and the\\njust is one   or that anything is one—to him i would appeal   saying  \\nwill you be so very kind   sir   as to tell us whether   of all these\\nbeautiful things   there is one which will not be found ugly   or of the\\njust   which will not be found unjust   or of the holy   which will not\\nalso be unholy  \\n\\nno   he replied   the beautiful will in some point of view be found ugly  \\nand the same is true of the rest  \\n\\nand may not the many which are doubles be also halves  —doubles   that\\nis   of one thing   and halves of another  \\n\\nquite true  \\n\\nand things great and small   heavy and light   as they are termed   will\\nnot be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names  \\n\\ntrue   both these and the opposite names will always attach to all of\\nthem  \\n\\nand can any one of those many things which are called by particular\\nnames be said to be this rather than not to be this  \\n\\nhe replied   they are like the punning riddles which are asked at feasts\\nor the children  s puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat   with what\\nhe hit him   as they say in the puzzle   and upon what the bat was\\nsitting   the individual objects of which i am speaking are also a\\nriddle   and have a double sense   nor can you fix them in your mind  \\neither as being or not  being   or both   or neither  \\n\\nthen what will you do with them   i said   can they have a better place\\nthan between being and not  being   for they are clearly not in greater\\ndarkness or negation than not  being   or more full of light and\\nexistence than being  \\n\\nthat is quite true   he said  \\n\\nthus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the\\nmultitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are\\ntossing about in some region which is half  way between pure being and\\npure not  being  \\n\\nwe have  \\n\\nyes   and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we might\\nfind was to be described as matter of opinion   and not as matter of\\nknowledge   being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained by\\nthe intermediate faculty  \\n\\nquite true  \\n\\nthen those who see the many beautiful   and who yet neither see absolute\\nbeauty   nor can follow any guide who points the way thither   who see\\nthe many just   and not absolute justice   and the like  —such persons may\\nbe said to have opinion but not knowledge  \\n\\nthat is certain  \\n\\nbut those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to\\nknow   and not to have opinion only  \\n\\nneither can that be denied  \\n\\nthe one love and embrace the subjects of knowledge   the other those of\\nopinion   the latter are the same   as i dare say you will remember   who\\nlistened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours   but would not\\ntolerate the existence of absolute beauty  \\n\\nyes   i remember  \\n\\nshall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers of\\nopinion rather than lovers of wisdom   and will they be very angry with\\nus for thus describing them  \\n\\ni shall tell them not to be angry   no man should be angry at what is\\ntrue  \\n\\nbut those who love the truth in each thing are to be called lovers of\\nwisdom and not lovers of opinion  \\n\\nassuredly  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book vi  \\n\\n\\nand thus   glaucon   after the argument has gone a weary way   the true\\nand the false philosophers have at length appeared in view  \\n\\ni do not think   he said   that the way could have been shortened  \\n\\ni suppose not   i said   and yet i believe that we might have had a\\nbetter view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined\\nto this one subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting\\nus   which he who desires to see in what respect the life of the just\\ndiffers from that of the unjust must consider  \\n\\nand what is the next question   he asked  \\n\\nsurely   i said   the one which follows next in order   inasmuch as\\nphilosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable   and\\nthose who wander in the region of the many and variable are not\\nphilosophers   i must ask you which of the two classes should be the\\nrulers of our state  \\n\\nand how can we rightly answer that question  \\n\\nwhichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions\\nof our state—let them be our guardians  \\n\\nvery good  \\n\\nneither   i said   can there be any question that the guardian who is to\\nkeep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes  \\n\\nthere can be no question of that  \\n\\nand are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge of\\nthe true being of each thing   and who have in their souls no clear\\npattern   and are unable as with a painter  s eye to look at the absolute\\ntruth and to that original to repair   and having perfect vision of the\\nother world to order the laws about beauty   goodness   justice in this  \\nif not already ordered   and to guard and preserve the order of them—are\\nnot such persons   i ask   simply blind  \\n\\ntruly   he replied   they are much in that condition  \\n\\nand shall they be our guardians when there are others who   besides\\nbeing their equals in experience and falling short of them in no\\nparticular of virtue   also know the very truth of each thing  \\n\\nthere can be no reason   he said   for rejecting those who have this\\ngreatest of all great qualities   they must always have the first place\\nunless they fail in some other respect  \\n\\nsuppose then   i said   that we determine how far they can unite this and\\nthe other excellences  \\n\\nby all means  \\n\\nin the first place   as we began by observing   the nature of the\\nphilosopher has to be ascertained   we must come to an understanding\\nabout him   and   when we have done so   then   if i am not mistaken   we\\nshall also acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible   and\\nthat those in whom they are united   and those only   should be rulers in\\nthe state  \\n\\nwhat do you mean  \\n\\nlet us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a sort\\nwhich shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and\\ncorruption  \\n\\nagreed  \\n\\nand further   i said   let us agree that they are lovers of all true\\nbeing   there is no part whether greater or less   or more or less\\nhonourable   which they are willing to renounce   as we said before of\\nthe lover and the man of ambition  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand if they are to be what we were describing   is there not another\\nquality which they should also possess  \\n\\nwhat quality  \\n\\ntruthfulness   they will never intentionally receive into their mind\\nfalsehood   which is their detestation   and they will love the truth  \\n\\nyes   that may be safely affirmed of them  \\n\\n  may be     my friend   i replied   is not the word   say rather   must be\\naffirmed     for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help\\nloving all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections  \\n\\nright   he said  \\n\\nand is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth  \\n\\nhow can there be  \\n\\ncan the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood  \\n\\nnever  \\n\\nthe true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth   as far as\\nin him lies   desire all truth  \\n\\nassuredly  \\n\\nbut then again   as we know by experience   he whose desires are strong\\nin one direction will have them weaker in others   they will be like a\\nstream which has been drawn off into another channel  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nhe whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be\\nabsorbed in the pleasures of the soul   and will hardly feel bodily\\npleasure—i mean   if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one  \\n\\nthat is most certain  \\n\\nsuch an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous   for\\nthe motives which make another man desirous of having and spending  \\nhave no place in his character  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nanother criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be\\nconsidered  \\n\\nwhat is that  \\n\\nthere should be no secret corner of illiberality   nothing can be more\\nantagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the\\nwhole of things both divine and human  \\n\\nmost true   he replied  \\n\\nthen how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of\\nall time and all existence   think much of human life  \\n\\nhe cannot  \\n\\nor can such an one account death fearful  \\n\\nno indeed  \\n\\nthen the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nor again   can he who is harmoniously constituted   who is not covetous\\nor mean   or a boaster   or a coward—can he   i say   ever be unjust or\\nhard in his dealings  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nthen you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle   or rude\\nand unsociable   these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the\\nphilosophical nature from the unphilosophical  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthere is another point which should be remarked  \\n\\nwhat point  \\n\\nwhether he has or has not a pleasure in learning   for no one will love\\nthat which gives him pain   and in which after much toil he makes little\\nprogress  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nand again   if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns  \\nwill he not be an empty vessel  \\n\\nthat is certain  \\n\\nlabouring in vain   he must end in hating himself and his fruitless\\noccupation   yes  \\n\\nthen a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic\\nnatures   we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand once more   the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to\\ndisproportion  \\n\\nundoubtedly  \\n\\nand do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion  \\n\\nto proportion  \\n\\nthen   besides other qualities   we must try to find a naturally\\nwell  proportioned and gracious mind   which will move spontaneously\\ntowards the true being of everything  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nwell   and do not all these qualities   which we have been enumerating  \\ngo together   and are they not   in a manner   necessary to a soul   which\\nis to have a full and perfect participation of being  \\n\\nthey are absolutely necessary   he replied  \\n\\nand must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who has\\nthe gift of a good memory   and is quick to learn  —noble   gracious   the\\nfriend of truth   justice   courage   temperance   who are his kindred  \\n\\nthe god of jealousy himself   he said   could find no fault with such a\\nstudy  \\n\\nand to men like him   i said   when perfected by years and education   and\\nto these only you will entrust the state  \\n\\nhere adeimantus interposed and said   to these statements   socrates   no\\none can offer a reply   but when you talk in this way   a strange feeling\\npasses over the minds of your hearers   they fancy that they are led\\nastray a little at each step in the argument   owing to their own want\\nof skill in asking and answering questions   these littles accumulate  \\nand at the end of the discussion they are found to have sustained a\\nmighty overthrow and all their former notions appear to be turned\\nupside down   and as unskilful players of draughts are at last shut up\\nby their more skilful adversaries and have no piece to move   so they\\ntoo find themselves shut up at last   for they have nothing to say in\\nthis new game of which words are the counters   and yet all the time\\nthey are in the right   the observation is suggested to me by what is\\nnow occurring   for any one of us might say   that although in words he\\nis not able to meet you at each step of the argument   he sees as a fact\\nthat the votaries of philosophy   when they carry on the study   not only\\nin youth as a part of education   but as the pursuit of their maturer\\nyears   most of them become strange monsters   not to say utter rogues  \\nand that those who may be considered the best of them are made useless\\nto the world by the very study which you extol  \\n\\nwell   and do you think that those who say so are wrong  \\n\\ni cannot tell   he replied   but i should like to know what is your\\nopinion  \\n\\nhear my answer   i am of opinion that they are quite right  \\n\\nthen how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease from\\nevil until philosophers rule in them   when philosophers are\\nacknowledged by us to be of no use to them  \\n\\nyou ask a question   i said   to which a reply can only be given in a\\nparable  \\n\\nyes   socrates   and that is a way of speaking to which you are not at\\nall accustomed   i suppose  \\n\\ni perceive   i said   that you are vastly amused at having plunged me\\ninto such a hopeless discussion   but now hear the parable   and then you\\nwill be still more amused at the meagreness of my imagination   for the\\nmanner in which the best men are treated in their own states is so\\ngrievous that no single thing on earth is comparable to it   and\\ntherefore   if i am to plead their cause   i must have recourse to\\nfiction   and put together a figure made up of many things   like the\\nfabulous unions of goats and stags which are found in pictures   imagine\\nthen a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is taller and\\nstronger than any of the crew   but he is a little deaf and has a\\nsimilar infirmity in sight   and his knowledge of navigation is not much\\nbetter   the sailors are quarrelling with one another about the\\nsteering—every one is of opinion that he has a right to steer   though\\nhe has never learned the art of navigation and cannot tell who taught\\nhim or when he learned   and will further assert that it cannot be\\ntaught   and they are ready to cut in pieces any one who says the\\ncontrary   they throng about the captain   begging and praying him to\\ncommit the helm to them   and if at any time they do not prevail   but\\nothers are preferred to them   they kill the others or throw them\\noverboard   and having first chained up the noble captain  s senses with\\ndrink or some narcotic drug   they mutiny and take possession of the\\nship and make free with the stores   thus   eating and drinking   they\\nproceed on their voyage in such manner as might be expected of them  \\nhim who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their plot for\\ngetting the ship out of the captain  s hands into their own whether by\\nforce or persuasion   they compliment with the name of sailor   pilot  \\nable seaman   and abuse the other sort of man   whom they call a\\ngood  for  nothing   but that the true pilot must pay attention to the\\nyear and seasons and sky and stars and winds   and whatever else belongs\\nto his art   if he intends to be really qualified for the command of a\\nship   and that he must and will be the steerer   whether other people\\nlike or not—the possibility of this union of authority with the\\nsteerer  s art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been\\nmade part of their calling   now in vessels which are in a state of\\nmutiny and by sailors who are mutineers   how will the true pilot be\\nregarded   will he not be called by them a prater   a star  gazer   a\\ngood  for  nothing  \\n\\nof course   said adeimantus  \\n\\nthen you will hardly need   i said   to hear the interpretation of the\\nfigure   which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the\\nstate   for you understand already  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nthen suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is\\nsurprised at finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities  \\nexplain it to him and try to convince him that their having honour\\nwould be far more extraordinary  \\n\\ni will  \\n\\nsay to him   that   in deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be\\nuseless to the rest of the world   he is right   but also tell him to\\nattribute their uselessness to the fault of those who will not use\\nthem   and not to themselves   the pilot should not humbly beg the\\nsailors to be commanded by him—that is not the order of nature   neither\\nare   the wise to go to the doors of the rich  —the ingenious author of\\nthis saying told a lie—but the truth is   that   when a man is ill  \\nwhether he be rich or poor   to the physician he must go   and he who\\nwants to be governed   to him who is able to govern   the ruler who is\\ngood for anything ought not to beg his subjects to be ruled by him  \\nalthough the present governors of mankind are of a different stamp  \\nthey may be justly compared to the mutinous sailors   and the true\\nhelmsmen to those who are called by them good  for  nothings and\\nstar  gazers  \\n\\nprecisely so   he said  \\n\\nfor these reasons   and among men like these   philosophy   the noblest\\npursuit of all   is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the\\nopposite faction   not that the greatest and most lasting injury is done\\nto her by her opponents   but by her own professing followers   the same\\nof whom you suppose the accuser to say   that the greater number of them\\nare arrant rogues   and the best are useless   in which opinion i agreed  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand the reason why the good are useless has now been explained  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthen shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is\\nalso unavoidable   and that this is not to be laid to the charge of\\nphilosophy any more than the other  \\n\\nby all means  \\n\\nand let us ask and answer in turn   first going back to the description\\nof the gentle and noble nature   truth   as you will remember   was his\\nleader   whom he followed always and in all things   failing in this   he\\nwas an impostor   and had no part or lot in true philosophy  \\n\\nyes   that was said  \\n\\nwell   and is not this one quality   to mention no others   greatly at\\nvariance with present notions of him  \\n\\ncertainly   he said  \\n\\nand have we not a right to say in his defence   that the true lover of\\nknowledge is always striving after being—that is his nature   he will\\nnot rest in the multiplicity of individuals which is an appearance\\nonly   but will go on—the keen edge will not be blunted   nor the force\\nof his desire abate until he have attained the knowledge of the true\\nnature of every essence by a sympathetic and kindred power in the soul  \\nand by that power drawing near and mingling and becoming incorporate\\nwith very being   having begotten mind and truth   he will have knowledge\\nand will live and grow truly   and then   and not till then   will he\\ncease from his travail  \\n\\nnothing   he said   can be more just than such a description of him  \\n\\nand will the love of a lie be any part of a philosopher  s nature   will\\nhe not utterly hate a lie  \\n\\nhe will  \\n\\nand when truth is the captain   we cannot suspect any evil of the band\\nwhich he leads  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\njustice and health of mind will be of the company   and temperance will\\nfollow after  \\n\\ntrue   he replied  \\n\\nneither is there any reason why i should again set in array the\\nphilosopher  s virtues   as you will doubtless remember that courage  \\nmagnificence   apprehension   memory   were his natural gifts   and you\\nobjected that   although no one could deny what i then said   still   if\\nyou leave words and look at facts   the persons who are thus described\\nare some of them manifestly useless   and the greater number utterly\\ndepraved   we were then led to enquire into the grounds of these\\naccusations   and have now arrived at the point of asking why are the\\nmajority bad   which question of necessity brought us back to the\\nexamination and definition of the true philosopher  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nand we have next to consider the corruptions of the philosophic nature  \\nwhy so many are spoiled and so few escape spoiling—i am speaking of\\nthose who were said to be useless but not wicked—and   when we have done\\nwith them   we will speak of the imitators of philosophy   what manner of\\nmen are they who aspire after a profession which is above them and of\\nwhich they are unworthy   and then   by their manifold inconsistencies  \\nbring upon philosophy   and upon all philosophers   that universal\\nreprobation of which we speak  \\n\\nwhat are these corruptions   he said  \\n\\ni will see if i can explain them to you   every one will admit that a\\nnature having in perfection all the qualities which we required in a\\nphilosopher   is a rare plant which is seldom seen among men  \\n\\nrare indeed  \\n\\nand what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare\\nnatures  \\n\\nwhat causes  \\n\\nin the first place there are their own virtues   their courage  \\ntemperance   and the rest of them   every one of which praiseworthy\\nqualities   and this is a most singular circumstance   destroys and\\ndistracts from philosophy the soul which is the possessor of them  \\n\\nthat is very singular   he replied  \\n\\nthen there are all the ordinary goods of life—beauty   wealth   strength  \\nrank   and great connections in the state—you understand the sort of\\nthings—these also have a corrupting and distracting effect  \\n\\ni understand   but i should like to know more precisely what you mean\\nabout them  \\n\\ngrasp the truth as a whole   i said   and in the right way   you will then\\nhave no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks   and they will\\nno longer appear strange to you  \\n\\nand how am i to do so   he asked  \\n\\nwhy   i said   we know that all germs or seeds   whether vegetable or\\nanimal   when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or\\nsoil   in proportion to their vigour   are all the more sensitive to the\\nwant of a suitable environment   for evil is a greater enemy to what is\\ngood than to what is not  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nthere is reason in supposing that the finest natures   when under alien\\nconditions   receive more injury than the inferior   because the contrast\\nis greater  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand may we not say   adeimantus   that the most gifted minds   when they\\nare ill  educated   become pre  eminently bad   do not great crimes and the\\nspirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by\\neducation rather than from any inferiority   whereas weak natures are\\nscarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil  \\n\\nthere i think that you are right  \\n\\nand our philosopher follows the same analogy—he is like a plant which  \\nhaving proper nurture   must necessarily grow and mature into all\\nvirtue   but   if sown and planted in an alien soil   becomes the most\\nnoxious of all weeds   unless he be preserved by some divine power   do\\nyou really think   as people so often say   that our youth are corrupted\\nby sophists   or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any\\ndegree worth speaking of   are not the public who say these things the\\ngreatest of all sophists   and do they not educate to perfection young\\nand old   men and women alike   and fashion them after their own hearts  \\n\\nwhen is this accomplished   he said  \\n\\nwhen they meet together   and the world sits down at an assembly   or in\\na court of law   or a theatre   or a camp   or in any other popular\\nresort   and there is a great uproar   and they praise some things which\\nare being said or done   and blame other things   equally exaggerating\\nboth   shouting and clapping their hands   and the echo of the rocks and\\nthe place in which they are assembled redoubles the sound of the praise\\nor blame—at such a time will not a young man  s heart   as they say   leap\\nwithin him   will any private training enable him to stand firm against\\nthe overwhelming flood of popular opinion   or will he be carried away\\nby the stream   will he not have the notions of good and evil which the\\npublic in general have—he will do as they do   and as they are   such\\nwill he be  \\n\\nyes   socrates   necessity will compel him  \\n\\nand yet   i said   there is a still greater necessity   which has not been\\nmentioned  \\n\\nwhat is that  \\n\\nthe gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death   which   as you\\nare aware   these new sophists and educators   who are the public   apply\\nwhen their words are powerless  \\n\\nindeed they do   and in right good earnest  \\n\\nnow what opinion of any other sophist   or of any private person   can be\\nexpected to overcome in such an unequal contest  \\n\\nnone   he replied  \\n\\nno   indeed   i said   even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly  \\nthere neither is   nor has been   nor is ever likely to be   any different\\ntype of character which has had no other training in virtue but that\\nwhich is supplied by public opinion—i speak   my friend   of human virtue\\nonly   what is more than human   as the proverb says   is not included  \\nfor i would not have you ignorant that   in the present evil state of\\ngovernments   whatever is saved and comes to good is saved by the power\\nof god   as we may truly say  \\n\\ni quite assent   he replied  \\n\\nthen let me crave your assent also to a further observation  \\n\\nwhat are you going to say  \\n\\nwhy   that all those mercenary individuals   whom the many call sophists\\nand whom they deem to be their adversaries   do   in fact   teach nothing\\nbut the opinion of the many   that is to say   the opinions of their\\nassemblies   and this is their wisdom   i might compare them to a man who\\nshould study the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who is\\nfed by him—he would learn how to approach and handle him   also at what\\ntimes and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse   and what is\\nthe meaning of his several cries   and by what sounds   when another\\nutters them   he is soothed or infuriated   and you may suppose further  \\nthat when   by continually attending upon him   he has become perfect in\\nall this   he calls his knowledge wisdom   and makes of it a system or\\nart   which he proceeds to teach   although he has no real notion of what\\nhe means by the principles or passions of which he is speaking   but\\ncalls this honourable and that dishonourable   or good or evil   or just\\nor unjust   all in accordance with the tastes and tempers of the great\\nbrute   good he pronounces to be that in which the beast delights and\\nevil to be that which he dislikes   and he can give no other account of\\nthem except that the just and noble are the necessary   having never\\nhimself seen   and having no power of explaining to others the nature of\\neither   or the difference between them   which is immense   by heaven  \\nwould not such an one be a rare educator  \\n\\nindeed he would  \\n\\nand in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of\\nthe tempers and tastes of the motley multitude   whether in painting or\\nmusic   or   finally   in politics   differ from him whom i have been\\ndescribing   for when a man consorts with the many   and exhibits to them\\nhis poem or other work of art or the service which he has done the\\nstate   making them his judges when he is not obliged   the so  called\\nnecessity of diomede will oblige him to produce whatever they praise  \\nand yet the reasons are utterly ludicrous which they give in\\nconfirmation of their own notions about the honourable and good   did\\nyou ever hear any of them which were not  \\n\\nno   nor am i likely to hear  \\n\\nyou recognise the truth of what i have been saying   then let me ask you\\nto consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe\\nin the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful  \\nor of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nthen the world cannot possibly be a philosopher  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nand therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure of\\nthe world  \\n\\nthey must  \\n\\nand of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them  \\n\\nthat is evident  \\n\\nthen   do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved in\\nhis calling to the end   and remember what we were saying of him   that\\nhe was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence—these\\nwere admitted by us to be the true philosopher  s gifts  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nwill not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first\\namong all   especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental\\nones  \\n\\ncertainly   he said  \\n\\nand his friends and fellow  citizens will want to use him as he gets\\nolder for their own purposes  \\n\\nno question  \\n\\nfalling at his feet   they will make requests to him and do him honour\\nand flatter him   because they want to get into their hands now   the\\npower which he will one day possess  \\n\\nthat often happens   he said  \\n\\nand what will a man such as he is be likely to do under such\\ncircumstances   especially if he be a citizen of a great city   rich and\\nnoble   and a tall proper youth   will he not be full of boundless\\naspirations   and fancy himself able to manage the affairs of hellenes\\nand of barbarians   and having got such notions into his head will he\\nnot dilate and elevate himself in the fulness of vain pomp and\\nsenseless pride  \\n\\nto be sure he will  \\n\\nnow   when he is in this state of mind   if some one gently comes to him\\nand tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding   which can\\nonly be got by slaving for it   do you think that   under such adverse\\ncircumstances   he will be easily induced to listen  \\n\\nfar otherwise  \\n\\nand even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural\\nreasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and\\ntaken captive by philosophy   how will his friends behave when they\\nthink that they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping\\nto reap from his companionship   will they not do and say anything to\\nprevent him from yielding to his better nature and to render his\\nteacher powerless   using to this end private intrigues as well as\\npublic prosecutions  \\n\\nthere can be no doubt of it  \\n\\nand how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nthen were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which\\nmake a man a philosopher may   if he be ill  educated   divert him from\\nphilosophy   no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other\\nso  called goods of life  \\n\\nwe were quite right  \\n\\nthus   my excellent friend   is brought about all that ruin and failure\\nwhich i have been describing of the natures best adapted to the best of\\nall pursuits   they are natures which we maintain to be rare at any\\ntime   this being the class out of which come the men who are the\\nauthors of the greatest evil to states and individuals   and also of the\\ngreatest good when the tide carries them in that direction   but a small\\nman never was the doer of any great thing either to individuals or to\\nstates  \\n\\nthat is most true   he said  \\n\\nand so philosophy is left desolate   with her marriage rite incomplete  \\nfor her own have fallen away and forsaken her   and while they are\\nleading a false and unbecoming life   other unworthy persons   seeing\\nthat she has no kinsmen to be her protectors   enter in and dishonour\\nher   and fasten upon her the reproaches which   as you say   her\\nreprovers utter   who affirm of her votaries that some are good for\\nnothing   and that the greater number deserve the severest punishment  \\n\\nthat is certainly what people say  \\n\\nyes   and what else would you expect   i said   when you think of the puny\\ncreatures who   seeing this land open to them—a land well stocked with\\nfair names and showy titles—like prisoners running out of prison into a\\nsanctuary   take a leap out of their trades into philosophy   those who\\ndo so being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable crafts  \\nfor   although philosophy be in this evil case   still there remains a\\ndignity about her which is not to be found in the arts   and many are\\nthus attracted by her whose natures are imperfect and whose souls are\\nmaimed and disfigured by their meannesses   as their bodies are by their\\ntrades and crafts   is not this unavoidable  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nare they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out of\\ndurance and come into a fortune   he takes a bath and puts on a new\\ncoat   and is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his master  s\\ndaughter   who is left poor and desolate  \\n\\na most exact parallel  \\n\\nwhat will be the issue of such marriages   will they not be vile and\\nbastard  \\n\\nthere can be no question of it  \\n\\nand when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy and\\nmake an alliance with her who is in a rank above them what sort of\\nideas and opinions are likely to be generated   will they not be\\nsophisms captivating to the ear   having nothing in them genuine   or\\nworthy of or akin to true wisdom  \\n\\nno doubt   he said  \\n\\nthen   adeimantus   i said   the worthy disciples of philosophy will be\\nbut a small remnant   perchance some noble and well  educated person  \\ndetained by exile in her service   who in the absence of corrupting\\ninfluences remains devoted to her   or some lofty soul born in a mean\\ncity   the politics of which he contemns and neglects   and there may be\\na gifted few who leave the arts   which they justly despise   and come to\\nher  —or peradventure there are some who are restrained by our friend\\ntheages   bridle   for everything in the life of theages conspired to\\ndivert him from philosophy   but ill  health kept him away from politics  \\nmy own case of the internal sign is hardly worth mentioning   for\\nrarely   if ever   has such a monitor been given to any other man   those\\nwho belong to this small class have tasted how sweet and blessed a\\npossession philosophy is   and have also seen enough of the madness of\\nthe multitude   and they know that no politician is honest   nor is there\\nany champion of justice at whose side they may fight and be saved   such\\nan one may be compared to a man who has fallen among wild beasts—he\\nwill not join in the wickedness of his fellows   but neither is he able\\nsingly to resist all their fierce natures   and therefore seeing that he\\nwould be of no use to the state or to his friends   and reflecting that\\nhe would have to throw away his life without doing any good either to\\nhimself or others   he holds his peace   and goes his own way   he is like\\none who   in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries\\nalong   retires under the shelter of a wall   and seeing the rest of\\nmankind full of wickedness   he is content   if only he can live his own\\nlife and be pure from evil or unrighteousness   and depart in peace and\\ngood  will   with bright hopes  \\n\\nyes   he said   and he will have done a great work before he departs  \\n\\na great work—yes   but not the greatest   unless he find a state suitable\\nto him   for in a state which is suitable to him   he will have a larger\\ngrowth and be the saviour of his country   as well as of himself  \\n\\nthe causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been\\nsufficiently explained   the injustice of the charges against her has\\nbeen shown—is there anything more which you wish to say  \\n\\nnothing more on that subject   he replied   but i should like to know\\nwhich of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one\\nadapted to her  \\n\\nnot any of them   i said   and that is precisely the accusation which i\\nbring against them—not one of them is worthy of the philosophic nature  \\nand hence that nature is warped and estranged  —as the exotic seed which\\nis sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized   and is wont to be\\noverpowered and to lose itself in the new soil   even so this growth of\\nphilosophy   instead of persisting   degenerates and receives another\\ncharacter   but if philosophy ever finds in the state that perfection\\nwhich she herself is   then will be seen that she is in truth divine  \\nand that all other things   whether natures of men or institutions   are\\nbut human  —and now   i know   that you are going to ask   what that state\\nis  \\n\\nno   he said   there you are wrong   for i was going to ask another\\nquestion—whether it is the state of which we are the founders and\\ninventors   or some other  \\n\\nyes   i replied   ours in most respects   but you may remember my saying\\nbefore   that some living authority would always be required in the\\nstate having the same idea of the constitution which guided you when as\\nlegislator you were laying down the laws  \\n\\nthat was said   he replied  \\n\\nyes   but not in a satisfactory manner   you frightened us by interposing\\nobjections   which certainly showed that the discussion would be long\\nand difficult   and what still remains is the reverse of easy  \\n\\nwhat is there remaining  \\n\\nthe question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not to be\\nthe ruin of the state   all great attempts are attended with risk     hard\\nis the good     as men say  \\n\\nstill   he said   let the point be cleared up   and the enquiry will then\\nbe complete  \\n\\ni shall not be hindered   i said   by any want of will   but   if at all  \\nby a want of power   my zeal you may see for yourselves   and please to\\nremark in what i am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly i\\ndeclare that states should pursue philosophy   not as they do now   but\\nin a different spirit  \\n\\nin what manner  \\n\\nat present   i said   the students of philosophy are quite young  \\nbeginning when they are hardly past childhood   they devote only the\\ntime saved from moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits   and even\\nthose of them who are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit  \\nwhen they come within sight of the great difficulty of the subject   i\\nmean dialectic   take themselves off   in after life when invited by some\\none else   they may   perhaps   go and hear a lecture   and about this they\\nmake much ado   for philosophy is not considered by them to be their\\nproper business   at last   when they grow old   in most cases they are\\nextinguished more truly than heracleitus   sun   inasmuch as they never\\nlight up again     heraclitus said that the sun was extinguished every\\nevening and relighted every morning    \\n\\nbut what ought to be their course  \\n\\njust the opposite   in childhood and youth their study   and what\\nphilosophy they learn   should be suited to their tender years   during\\nthis period while they are growing up towards manhood   the chief and\\nspecial care should be given to their bodies that they may have them to\\nuse in the service of philosophy   as life advances and the intellect\\nbegins to mature   let them increase the gymnastics of the soul   but\\nwhen the strength of our citizens fails and is past civil and military\\nduties   then let them range at will and engage in no serious labour   as\\nwe intend them to live happily here   and to crown this life with a\\nsimilar happiness in another  \\n\\nhow truly in earnest you are   socrates   he said   i am sure of that   and\\nyet most of your hearers   if i am not mistaken   are likely to be still\\nmore earnest in their opposition to you   and will never be convinced  \\nthrasymachus least of all  \\n\\ndo not make a quarrel   i said   between thrasymachus and me   who have\\nrecently become friends   although   indeed   we were never enemies   for i\\nshall go on striving to the utmost until i either convert him and other\\nmen   or do something which may profit them against the day when they\\nlive again   and hold the like discourse in another state of existence  \\n\\nyou are speaking of a time which is not very near  \\n\\nrather   i replied   of a time which is as nothing in comparison with\\neternity   nevertheless   i do not wonder that the many refuse to\\nbelieve   for they have never seen that of which we are now speaking\\nrealized   they have seen only a conventional imitation of philosophy  \\nconsisting of words artificially brought together   not like these of\\nours having a natural unity   but a human being who in word and work is\\nperfectly moulded   as far as he can be   into the proportion and\\nlikeness of virtue—such a man ruling in a city which bears the same\\nimage   they have never yet seen   neither one nor many of them—do you\\nthink that they ever did  \\n\\nno indeed  \\n\\nno   my friend   and they have seldom   if ever   heard free and noble\\nsentiments   such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every\\nmeans in their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge  \\nwhile they look coldly on the subtleties of controversy   of which the\\nend is opinion and strife   whether they meet with them in the courts of\\nlaw or in society  \\n\\nthey are strangers   he said   to the words of which you speak  \\n\\nand this was what we foresaw   and this was the reason why truth forced\\nus to admit   not without fear and hesitation   that neither cities nor\\nstates nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small\\nclass of philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are\\nprovidentially compelled   whether they will or not   to take care of the\\nstate   and until a like necessity be laid on the state to obey them   or\\nuntil kings   or if not kings   the sons of kings or princes   are\\ndivinely inspired with a true love of true philosophy   that either or\\nboth of these alternatives are impossible   i see no reason to affirm  \\nif they were so   we might indeed be justly ridiculed as dreamers and\\nvisionaries   am i not right  \\n\\nquite right  \\n\\nif then   in the countless ages of the past   or at the present hour in\\nsome foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken   the perfected\\nphilosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a\\nsuperior power to have the charge of the state   we are ready to assert\\nto the death   that this our constitution has been   and is—yea   and will\\nbe whenever the muse of philosophy is queen   there is no impossibility\\nin all this   that there is a difficulty   we acknowledge ourselves  \\n\\nmy opinion agrees with yours   he said  \\n\\nbut do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude  \\n\\ni should imagine not   he replied  \\n\\no my friend   i said   do not attack the multitude   they will change\\ntheir minds   if   not in an aggressive spirit   but gently and with the\\nview of soothing them and removing their dislike of over  education   you\\nshow them your philosophers as they really are and describe as you were\\njust now doing their character and profession   and then mankind will\\nsee that he of whom you are speaking is not such as they supposed—if\\nthey view him in this new light   they will surely change their notion\\nof him   and answer in another strain   who can be at enmity with one who\\nloves them   who that is himself gentle and free from envy will be\\njealous of one in whom there is no jealousy   nay   let me answer for\\nyou   that in a few this harsh temper may be found but not in the\\nmajority of mankind  \\n\\ni quite agree with you   he said  \\n\\nand do you not also think   as i do   that the harsh feeling which the\\nmany entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders   who\\nrush in uninvited   and are always abusing them   and finding fault with\\nthem   who make persons instead of things the theme of their\\nconversation   and nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than\\nthis  \\n\\nit is most unbecoming  \\n\\nfor he   adeimantus   whose mind is fixed upon true being   has surely no\\ntime to look down upon the affairs of earth   or to be filled with\\nmalice and envy   contending against men   his eye is ever directed\\ntowards things fixed and immutable   which he sees neither injuring nor\\ninjured by one another   but all in order moving according to reason  \\nthese he imitates   and to these he will   as far as he can   conform\\nhimself   can a man help imitating that with which he holds reverential\\nconverse  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nand the philosopher holding converse with the divine order   becomes\\norderly and divine   as far as the nature of man allows   but like every\\none else   he will suffer from detraction  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nand if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning   not only himself  \\nbut human nature generally   whether in states or individuals   into that\\nwhich he beholds elsewhere   will he   think you   be an unskilful\\nartificer of justice   temperance   and every civil virtue  \\n\\nanything but unskilful  \\n\\nand if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the\\ntruth   will they be angry with philosophy   will they disbelieve us  \\nwhen we tell them that no state can be happy which is not designed by\\nartists who imitate the heavenly pattern  \\n\\nthey will not be angry if they understand   he said   but how will they\\ndraw out the plan of which you are speaking  \\n\\nthey will begin by taking the state and the manners of men   from which  \\nas from a tablet   they will rub out the picture   and leave a clean\\nsurface   this is no easy task   but whether easy or not   herein will lie\\nthe difference between them and every other legislator  —they will have\\nnothing to do either with individual or state   and will inscribe no\\nlaws   until they have either found   or themselves made   a clean\\nsurface  \\n\\nthey will be very right   he said  \\n\\nhaving effected this   they will proceed to trace an outline of the\\nconstitution  \\n\\nno doubt  \\n\\nand when they are filling in the work   as i conceive   they will often\\nturn their eyes upwards and downwards   i mean that they will first look\\nat absolute justice and beauty and temperance   and again at the human\\ncopy   and will mingle and temper the various elements of life into the\\nimage of a man   and this they will conceive according to that other\\nimage   which   when existing among men   homer calls the form and\\nlikeness of god  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nand one feature they will erase   and another they will put in   until\\nthey have made the ways of men   as far as possible   agreeable to the\\nways of god  \\n\\nindeed   he said   in no way could they make a fairer picture  \\n\\nand now   i said   are we beginning to persuade those whom you described\\nas rushing at us with might and main   that the painter of constitutions\\nis such an one as we are praising   at whom they were so very indignant\\nbecause to his hands we committed the state   and are they growing a\\nlittle calmer at what they have just heard  \\n\\nmuch calmer   if there is any sense in them  \\n\\nwhy   where can they still find any ground for objection   will they\\ndoubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being  \\n\\nthey would not be so unreasonable  \\n\\nor that his nature   being such as we have delineated   is akin to the\\nhighest good  \\n\\nneither can they doubt this  \\n\\nbut again   will they tell us that such a nature   placed under\\nfavourable circumstances   will not be perfectly good and wise if any\\never was   or will they prefer those whom we have rejected  \\n\\nsurely not  \\n\\nthen will they still be angry at our saying   that   until philosophers\\nbear rule   states and individuals will have no rest from evil   nor will\\nthis our imaginary state ever be realized  \\n\\ni think that they will be less angry  \\n\\nshall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle   and\\nthat they have been converted and for very shame   if for no other\\nreason   cannot refuse to come to terms  \\n\\nby all means   he said  \\n\\nthen let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected   will any\\none deny the other point   that there may be sons of kings or princes\\nwho are by nature philosophers  \\n\\nsurely no man   he said  \\n\\nand when they have come into being will any one say that they must of\\nnecessity be destroyed   that they can hardly be saved is not denied\\neven by us   but that in the whole course of ages no single one of them\\ncan escape—who will venture to affirm this  \\n\\nwho indeed  \\n\\nbut   said i   one is enough   let there be one man who has a city\\nobedient to his will   and he might bring into existence the ideal\\npolity about which the world is so incredulous  \\n\\nyes   one is enough  \\n\\nthe ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been\\ndescribing   and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand that others should approve   of what we approve   is no miracle or\\nimpossibility  \\n\\ni think not  \\n\\nbut we have sufficiently shown   in what has preceded   that all this   if\\nonly possible   is assuredly for the best  \\n\\nwe have  \\n\\nand now we say not only that our laws   if they could be enacted   would\\nbe for the best   but also that the enactment of them   though difficult  \\nis not impossible  \\n\\nvery good  \\n\\nand so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject   but\\nmore remains to be discussed  —how and by what studies and pursuits will\\nthe saviours of the constitution be created   and at what ages are they\\nto apply themselves to their several studies  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\ni omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women   and the\\nprocreation of children   and the appointment of the rulers   because i\\nknew that the perfect state would be eyed with jealousy and was\\ndifficult of attainment   but that piece of cleverness was not of much\\nservice to me   for i had to discuss them all the same   the women and\\nchildren are now disposed of   but the other question of the rulers must\\nbe investigated from the very beginning   we were saying   as you will\\nremember   that they were to be lovers of their country   tried by the\\ntest of pleasures and pains   and neither in hardships   nor in dangers  \\nnor at any other critical moment were to lose their patriotism—he was\\nto be rejected who failed   but he who always came forth pure   like gold\\ntried in the refiner  s fire   was to be made a ruler   and to receive\\nhonours and rewards in life and after death   this was the sort of thing\\nwhich was being said   and then the argument turned aside and veiled her\\nface   not liking to stir the question which has now arisen  \\n\\ni perfectly remember   he said  \\n\\nyes   my friend   i said   and i then shrank from hazarding the bold word  \\nbut now let me dare to say—that the perfect guardian must be a\\nphilosopher  \\n\\nyes   he said   let that be affirmed  \\n\\nand do not suppose that there will be many of them   for the gifts which\\nwere deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together   they are mostly\\nfound in shreds and patches  \\n\\nwhat do you mean   he said  \\n\\nyou are aware   i replied   that quick intelligence   memory   sagacity  \\ncleverness   and similar qualities   do not often grow together   and that\\npersons who possess them and are at the same time high  spirited and\\nmagnanimous are not so constituted by nature as to live orderly and in\\na peaceful and settled manner   they are driven any way by their\\nimpulses   and all solid principle goes out of them  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\non the other hand   those steadfast natures which can better be depended\\nupon   which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable   are\\nequally immovable when there is anything to be learned   they are always\\nin a torpid state   and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any\\nintellectual toil  \\n\\nquite true  \\n\\nand yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those to\\nwhom the higher education is to be imparted   and who are to share in\\nany office or command  \\n\\ncertainly   he said  \\n\\nand will they be a class which is rarely found  \\n\\nyes   indeed  \\n\\nthen the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and dangers\\nand pleasures which we mentioned before   but there is another kind of\\nprobation which we did not mention—he must be exercised also in many\\nkinds of knowledge   to see whether the soul will be able to endure the\\nhighest of all   or will faint under them   as in any other studies and\\nexercises  \\n\\nyes   he said   you are quite right in testing him   but what do you mean\\nby the highest of all knowledge  \\n\\nyou may remember   i said   that we divided the soul into three parts  \\nand distinguished the several natures of justice   temperance   courage  \\nand wisdom  \\n\\nindeed   he said   if i had forgotten   i should not deserve to hear more  \\n\\nand do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion\\nof them  \\n\\nto what do you refer  \\n\\nwe were saying   if i am not mistaken   that he who wanted to see them in\\ntheir perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way   at the\\nend of which they would appear   but that we could add on a popular\\nexposition of them on a level with the discussion which had preceded  \\nand you replied that such an exposition would be enough for you   and so\\nthe enquiry was continued in what to me seemed to be a very inaccurate\\nmanner   whether you were satisfied or not   it is for you to say  \\n\\nyes   he said   i thought and the others thought that you gave us a fair\\nmeasure of truth  \\n\\nbut   my friend   i said   a measure of such things which in any degree\\nfalls short of the whole truth is not fair measure   for nothing\\nimperfect is the measure of anything   although persons are too apt to\\nbe contented and think that they need search no further  \\n\\nnot an uncommon case when people are indolent  \\n\\nyes   i said   and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the\\nstate and of the laws  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthe guardian then   i said   must be required to take the longer circuit  \\nand toil at learning as well as at gymnastics   or he will never reach\\nthe highest knowledge of all which   as we were just now saying   is his\\nproper calling  \\n\\nwhat   he said   is there a knowledge still higher than this—higher than\\njustice and the other virtues  \\n\\nyes   i said   there is   and of the virtues too we must behold not the\\noutline merely   as at present—nothing short of the most finished\\npicture should satisfy us   when little things are elaborated with an\\ninfinity of pains   in order that they may appear in their full beauty\\nand utmost clearness   how ridiculous that we should not think the\\nhighest truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy  \\n\\na right noble thought   but do you suppose that we shall refrain from\\nasking you what is this highest knowledge  \\n\\nnay   i said   ask if you will   but i am certain that you have heard the\\nanswer many times   and now you either do not understand me or   as i\\nrather think   you are disposed to be troublesome   for you have often\\nbeen told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge   and that all\\nother things become useful and advantageous only by their use of this  \\nyou can hardly be ignorant that of this i was about to speak  \\nconcerning which   as you have often heard me say   we know so little  \\nand   without which   any other knowledge or possession of any kind will\\nprofit us nothing   do you think that the possession of all other things\\nis of any value if we do not possess the good   or the knowledge of all\\nother things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness  \\n\\nassuredly not  \\n\\nyou are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good  \\nbut the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by\\nknowledge   but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good  \\n\\nhow ridiculous  \\n\\nyes   i said   that they should begin by reproaching us with our\\nignorance of the good   and then presume our knowledge of it—for the\\ngood they define to be knowledge of the good   just as if we understood\\nthem when they use the term   good  —this is of course ridiculous  \\n\\nmost true   he said  \\n\\nand those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity   for\\nthey are compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as\\ngood  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthere can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this\\nquestion is involved  \\n\\nthere can be none  \\n\\nfurther   do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or to\\nseem to be what is just and honourable without the reality   but no one\\nis satisfied with the appearance of good—the reality is what they seek  \\nin the case of the good   appearance is despised by every one  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nof this then   which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of all\\nhis actions   having a presentiment that there is such an end   and yet\\nhesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the same\\nassurance of this as of other things   and therefore losing whatever\\ngood there is in other things  —of a principle such and so great as this\\nought the best men in our state   to whom everything is entrusted   to be\\nin the darkness of ignorance  \\n\\ncertainly not   he said  \\n\\ni am sure   i said   that he who does not know how the beautiful and the\\njust are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them   and i\\nsuspect that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true\\nknowledge of them  \\n\\nthat   he said   is a shrewd suspicion of yours  \\n\\nand if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our state will be\\nperfectly ordered  \\n\\nof course   he replied   but i wish that you would tell me whether you\\nconceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or\\npleasure   or different from either  \\n\\naye   i said   i knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you\\nwould not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these\\nmatters  \\n\\ntrue   socrates   but i must say that one who like you has passed a\\nlifetime in the study of philosophy should not be always repeating the\\nopinions of others   and never telling his own  \\n\\nwell   but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know  \\n\\nnot   he said   with the assurance of positive certainty   he has no right\\nto do that   but he may say what he thinks   as a matter of opinion  \\n\\nand do you not know   i said   that all mere opinions are bad   and the\\nbest of them blind   you would not deny that those who have any true\\nnotion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way\\nalong the road  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base   when\\nothers will tell you of brightness and beauty  \\n\\nstill   i must implore you   socrates   said glaucon   not to turn away\\njust as you are reaching the goal   if you will only give such an\\nexplanation of the good as you have already given of justice and\\ntemperance and the other virtues   we shall be satisfied  \\n\\nyes   my friend   and i shall be at least equally satisfied   but i cannot\\nhelp fearing that i shall fail   and that my indiscreet zeal will bring\\nridicule upon me   no   sweet sirs   let us not at present ask what is the\\nactual nature of the good   for to reach what is now in my thoughts\\nwould be an effort too great for me   but of the child of the good who\\nis likest him   i would fain speak   if i could be sure that you wished\\nto hear—otherwise   not  \\n\\nby all means   he said   tell us about the child   and you shall remain in\\nour debt for the account of the parent  \\n\\ni do indeed wish   i replied   that i could pay   and you receive   the\\naccount of the parent   and not   as now   of the offspring only   take  \\nhowever   this latter by way of interest   and at the same time have a\\ncare that i do not render a false account   although i have no intention\\nof deceiving you  \\n\\nyes   we will take all the care that we can   proceed  \\n\\nyes   i said   but i must first come to an understanding with you   and\\nremind you of what i have mentioned in the course of this discussion  \\nand at many other times  \\n\\nwhat  \\n\\nthe old story   that there is a many beautiful and a many good   and so\\nof other things which we describe and define   to all of them the term\\n  many   is applied  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nand there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good   and of other\\nthings to which the term   many   is applied there is an absolute   for\\nthey may be brought under a single idea   which is called the essence of\\neach  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nthe many   as we say   are seen but not known   and the ideas are known\\nbut not seen  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nand what is the organ with which we see the visible things  \\n\\nthe sight   he said  \\n\\nand with the hearing   i said   we hear   and with the other senses\\nperceive the other objects of sense  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nbut have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex\\npiece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived  \\n\\nno   i never have   he said  \\n\\nthen reflect   has the ear or voice need of any third or additional\\nnature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be\\nheard  \\n\\nnothing of the sort  \\n\\nno   indeed   i replied   and the same is true of most   if not all   the\\nother senses—you would not say that any of them requires such an\\naddition  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nbut you see that without the addition of some other nature there is no\\nseeing or being seen  \\n\\nhow do you mean  \\n\\nsight being   as i conceive   in the eyes   and he who has eyes wanting to\\nsee   colour being also present in them   still unless there be a third\\nnature specially adapted to the purpose   the owner of the eyes will see\\nnothing and the colours will be invisible  \\n\\nof what nature are you speaking  \\n\\nof that which you term light   i replied  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nnoble   then   is the bond which links together sight and visibility   and\\ngreat beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature   for light is\\ntheir bond   and light is no ignoble thing  \\n\\nnay   he said   the reverse of ignoble  \\n\\nand which   i said   of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord of\\nthis element   whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly\\nand the visible to appear  \\n\\nyou mean the sun   as you and all mankind say  \\n\\nmay not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows  \\n\\nhow  \\n\\nneither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun  \\n\\nno  \\n\\nyet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the sun  \\n\\nby far the most like  \\n\\nand the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is\\ndispensed from the sun  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nthen the sun is not sight   but the author of sight who is recognised by\\nsight  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nand this is he whom i call the child of the good   whom the good begat\\nin his own likeness   to be in the visible world   in relation to sight\\nand the things of sight   what the good is in the intellectual world in\\nrelation to mind and the things of mind  \\n\\nwill you be a little more explicit   he said  \\n\\nwhy   you know   i said   that the eyes   when a person directs them\\ntowards objects on which the light of day is no longer shining   but the\\nmoon and stars only   see dimly   and are nearly blind   they seem to have\\nno clearness of vision in them  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nbut when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines  \\nthey see clearly and there is sight in them  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand the soul is like the eye   when resting upon that on which truth and\\nbeing shine   the soul perceives and understands   and is radiant with\\nintelligence   but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and\\nperishing   then she has opinion only   and goes blinking about   and is\\nfirst of one opinion and then of another   and seems to have no\\nintelligence  \\n\\njust so  \\n\\nnow   that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing to\\nthe knower is what i would have you term the idea of good   and this you\\nwill deem to be the cause of science   and of truth in so far as the\\nlatter becomes the subject of knowledge   beautiful too   as are both\\ntruth and knowledge   you will be right in esteeming this other nature\\nas more beautiful than either   and   as in the previous instance   light\\nand sight may be truly said to be like the sun   and yet not to be the\\nsun   so in this other sphere   science and truth may be deemed to be\\nlike the good   but not the good   the good has a place of honour yet\\nhigher  \\n\\nwhat a wonder of beauty that must be   he said   which is the author of\\nscience and truth   and yet surpasses them in beauty   for you surely\\ncannot mean to say that pleasure is the good  \\n\\ngod forbid   i replied   but may i ask you to consider the image in\\nanother point of view  \\n\\nin what point of view  \\n\\nyou would say   would you not   that the sun is not only the author of\\nvisibility in all visible things   but of generation and nourishment and\\ngrowth   though he himself is not generation  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nin like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of\\nknowledge to all things known   but of their being and essence   and yet\\nthe good is not essence   but far exceeds essence in dignity and power  \\n\\nglaucon said   with a ludicrous earnestness   by the light of heaven   how\\namazing  \\n\\nyes   i said   and the exaggeration may be set down to you   for you made\\nme utter my fancies  \\n\\nand pray continue to utter them   at any rate let us hear if there is\\nanything more to be said about the similitude of the sun  \\n\\nyes   i said   there is a great deal more  \\n\\nthen omit nothing   however slight  \\n\\ni will do my best   i said   but i should think that a great deal will\\nhave to be omitted  \\n\\ni hope not   he said  \\n\\nyou have to imagine   then   that there are two ruling powers   and that\\none of them is set over the intellectual world   the other over the\\nvisible   i do not say heaven   lest you should fancy that i am playing\\nupon the name     ourhanoz   orhatoz       may i suppose that you have this\\ndistinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind  \\n\\ni have  \\n\\nnow take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts   and divide\\neach of them again in the same proportion   and suppose the two main\\ndivisions to answer   one to the visible and the other to the\\nintelligible   and then compare the subdivisions in respect of their\\nclearness and want of clearness   and you will find that the first\\nsection in the sphere of the visible consists of images   and by images\\ni mean   in the first place   shadows   and in the second place  \\nreflections in water and in solid   smooth and polished bodies and the\\nlike   do you understand  \\n\\nyes   i understand  \\n\\nimagine   now   the other section   of which this is only the resemblance  \\nto include the animals which we see   and everything that grows or is\\nmade  \\n\\nvery good  \\n\\nwould you not admit that both the sections of this division have\\ndifferent degrees of truth   and that the copy is to the original as the\\nsphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge  \\n\\nmost undoubtedly  \\n\\nnext proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the\\nintellectual is to be divided  \\n\\nin what manner  \\n\\nthus  —there are two subdivisions   in the lower of which the soul uses\\nthe figures given by the former division as images   the enquiry can\\nonly be hypothetical   and instead of going upwards to a principle\\ndescends to the other end   in the higher of the two   the soul passes\\nout of hypotheses   and goes up to a principle which is above\\nhypotheses   making no use of images as in the former case   but\\nproceeding only in and through the ideas themselves  \\n\\ni do not quite understand your meaning   he said  \\n\\nthen i will try again   you will understand me better when i have made\\nsome preliminary remarks   you are aware that students of geometry  \\narithmetic   and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and\\nthe figures and three kinds of angles and the like in their several\\nbranches of science   these are their hypotheses   which they and every\\nbody are supposed to know   and therefore they do not deign to give any\\naccount of them either to themselves or others   but they begin with\\nthem   and go on until they arrive at last   and in a consistent manner  \\nat their conclusion  \\n\\nyes   he said   i know  \\n\\nand do you not know also that although they make use of the visible\\nforms and reason about them   they are thinking not of these   but of the\\nideals which they resemble   not of the figures which they draw   but of\\nthe absolute square and the absolute diameter   and so on—the forms\\nwhich they draw or make   and which have shadows and reflections in\\nwater of their own   are converted by them into images   but they are\\nreally seeking to behold the things themselves   which can only be seen\\nwith the eye of the mind  \\n\\nthat is true  \\n\\nand of this kind i spoke as the intelligible   although in the search\\nafter it the soul is compelled to use hypotheses   not ascending to a\\nfirst principle   because she is unable to rise above the region of\\nhypothesis   but employing the objects of which the shadows below are\\nresemblances in their turn as images   they having in relation to the\\nshadows and reflections of them a greater distinctness   and therefore a\\nhigher value  \\n\\ni understand   he said   that you are speaking of the province of\\ngeometry and the sister arts  \\n\\nand when i speak of the other division of the intelligible   you will\\nunderstand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason\\nherself attains by the power of dialectic   using the hypotheses not as\\nfirst principles   but only as hypotheses—that is to say   as steps and\\npoints of departure into a world which is above hypotheses   in order\\nthat she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole   and\\nclinging to this and then to that which depends on this   by successive\\nsteps she descends again without the aid of any sensible object   from\\nideas   through ideas   and in ideas she ends  \\n\\ni understand you   he replied   not perfectly   for you seem to me to be\\ndescribing a task which is really tremendous   but   at any rate   i\\nunderstand you to say that knowledge and being   which the science of\\ndialectic contemplates   are clearer than the notions of the arts   as\\nthey are termed   which proceed from hypotheses only   these are also\\ncontemplated by the understanding   and not by the senses   yet   because\\nthey start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle   those who\\ncontemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher reason upon\\nthem   although when a first principle is added to them they are\\ncognizable by the higher reason   and the habit which is concerned with\\ngeometry and the cognate sciences i suppose that you would term\\nunderstanding and not reason   as being intermediate between opinion and\\nreason  \\n\\nyou have quite conceived my meaning   i said   and now   corresponding to\\nthese four divisions   let there be four faculties in the soul—reason\\nanswering to the highest   understanding to the second   faith   or\\nconviction   to the third   and perception of shadows to the last—and let\\nthere be a scale of them   and let us suppose that the several faculties\\nhave clearness in the same degree that their objects have truth  \\n\\ni understand   he replied   and give my assent   and accept your\\narrangement  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book vii  \\n\\n\\nand now   i said   let me show in a figure how far our nature is\\nenlightened or unenlightened  —behold   human beings living in a\\nunderground den   which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching\\nall along the den   here they have been from their childhood   and have\\ntheir legs and necks chained so that they cannot move   and can only see\\nbefore them   being prevented by the chains from turning round their\\nheads   above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance   and\\nbetween the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way   and you will\\nsee   if you look   a low wall built along the way   like the screen which\\nmarionette players have in front of them   over which they show the\\npuppets  \\n\\ni see  \\n\\nand do you see   i said   men passing along the wall carrying all sorts\\nof vessels   and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone\\nand various materials   which appear over the wall   some of them are\\ntalking   others silent  \\n\\nyou have shown me a strange image   and they are strange prisoners  \\n\\nlike ourselves   i replied   and they see only their own shadows   or the\\nshadows of one another   which the fire throws on the opposite wall of\\nthe cave  \\n\\ntrue   he said   how could they see anything but the shadows if they were\\nnever allowed to move their heads  \\n\\nand of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would\\nonly see the shadows  \\n\\nyes   he said  \\n\\nand if they were able to converse with one another   would they not\\nsuppose that they were naming what was actually before them  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the\\nother side   would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers  by\\nspoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow  \\n\\nno question   he replied  \\n\\nto them   i said   the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows\\nof the images  \\n\\nthat is certain  \\n\\nand now look again   and see what will naturally follow if the prisoners\\nare released and disabused of their error   at first   when any of them\\nis liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round\\nand walk and look towards the light   he will suffer sharp pains   the\\nglare will distress him   and he will be unable to see the realities of\\nwhich in his former state he had seen the shadows   and then conceive\\nsome one saying to him   that what he saw before was an illusion   but\\nthat now   when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned\\ntowards more real existence   he has a clearer vision  —what will be his\\nreply   and you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to\\nthe objects as they pass and requiring him to name them  —will he not be\\nperplexed   will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are\\ntruer than the objects which are now shown to him  \\n\\nfar truer  \\n\\nand if he is compelled to look straight at the light   will he not have\\na pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the\\nobjects of vision which he can see   and which he will conceive to be in\\nreality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nand suppose once more   that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and\\nrugged ascent   and held fast until he is forced into the presence of\\nthe sun himself   is he not likely to be pained and irritated   when he\\napproaches the light his eyes will be dazzled   and he will not be able\\nto see anything at all of what are now called realities  \\n\\nnot all in a moment   he said  \\n\\nhe will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world   and\\nfirst he will see the shadows best   next the reflections of men and\\nother objects in the water   and then the objects themselves   then he\\nwill gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled\\nheaven   and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the\\nsun or the light of the sun by day  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nlast of all he will be able to see the sun   and not mere reflections of\\nhim in the water   but he will see him in his own proper place   and not\\nin another   and he will contemplate him as he is  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nhe will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and\\nthe years   and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world   and\\nin a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have\\nbeen accustomed to behold  \\n\\nclearly   he said   he would first see the sun and then reason about him  \\n\\nand when he remembered his old habitation   and the wisdom of the den\\nand his fellow  prisoners   do you not suppose that he would felicitate\\nhimself on the change   and pity them  \\n\\ncertainly   he would  \\n\\nand if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves on\\nthose who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark\\nwhich of them went before   and which followed after   and which were\\ntogether   and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to\\nthe future   do you think that he would care for such honours and\\nglories   or envy the possessors of them   would he not say with homer  \\n\\n  better to be the poor servant of a poor master    \\n\\nand to endure anything   rather than think as they do and live after\\ntheir manner  \\n\\nyes   he said   i think that he would rather suffer anything than\\nentertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner  \\n\\nimagine once more   i said   such an one coming suddenly out of the sun\\nto be replaced in his old situation   would he not be certain to have\\nhis eyes full of darkness  \\n\\nto be sure   he said  \\n\\nand if there were a contest   and he had to compete in measuring the\\nshadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den   while\\nhis sight was still weak   and before his eyes had become steady   and\\nthe time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might\\nbe very considerable     would he not be ridiculous   men would say of him\\nthat up he went and down he came without his eyes   and that it was\\nbetter not even to think of ascending   and if any one tried to loose\\nanother and lead him up to the light   let them only catch the offender  \\nand they would put him to death  \\n\\nno question   he said  \\n\\nthis entire allegory   i said   you may now append   dear glaucon   to the\\nprevious argument   the prison  house is the world of sight   the light of\\nthe fire is the sun   and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret\\nthe journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual\\nworld according to my poor belief   which   at your desire   i have\\nexpressed—whether rightly or wrongly god knows   but   whether true or\\nfalse   my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good\\nappears last of all   and is seen only with an effort   and   when seen  \\nis also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and\\nright   parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world  \\nand the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual   and\\nthat this is the power upon which he who would act rationally either in\\npublic or private life must have his eye fixed  \\n\\ni agree   he said   as far as i am able to understand you  \\n\\nmoreover   i said   you must not wonder that those who attain to this\\nbeatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs   for their\\nsouls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to\\ndwell   which desire of theirs is very natural   if our allegory may be\\ntrusted  \\n\\nyes   very natural  \\n\\nand is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine\\ncontemplations to the evil state of man   misbehaving himself in a\\nridiculous manner   if   while his eyes are blinking and before he has\\nbecome accustomed to the surrounding darkness   he is compelled to fight\\nin courts of law   or in other places   about the images or the shadows\\nof images of justice   and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of\\nthose who have never yet seen absolute justice  \\n\\nanything but surprising   he replied  \\n\\nany one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of\\nthe eyes are of two kinds   and arise from two causes   either from\\ncoming out of the light or from going into the light   which is true of\\nthe mind  s eye   quite as much as of the bodily eye   and he who\\nremembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak  \\nwill not be too ready to laugh   he will first ask whether that soul of\\nman has come out of the brighter life   and is unable to see because\\nunaccustomed to the dark   or having turned from darkness to the day is\\ndazzled by excess of light   and he will count the one happy in his\\ncondition and state of being   and he will pity the other   or   if he\\nhave a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light  \\nthere will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him\\nwho returns from above out of the light into the den  \\n\\nthat   he said   is a very just distinction  \\n\\nbut then   if i am right   certain professors of education must be wrong\\nwhen they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not\\nthere before   like sight into blind eyes  \\n\\nthey undoubtedly say this   he replied  \\n\\nwhereas   our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning\\nexists in the soul already   and that just as the eye was unable to turn\\nfrom darkness to light without the whole body   so too the instrument of\\nknowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the\\nworld of becoming into that of being   and learn by degrees to endure\\nthe sight of being   and of the brightest and best of being   or in other\\nwords   of the good  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the\\neasiest and quickest manner   not implanting the faculty of sight   for\\nthat exists already   but has been turned in the wrong direction   and is\\nlooking away from the truth  \\n\\nyes   he said   such an art may be presumed  \\n\\nand whereas the other so  called virtues of the soul seem to be akin to\\nbodily qualities   for even when they are not originally innate they can\\nbe implanted later by habit and exercise   the virtue of wisdom more\\nthan anything else contains a divine element which always remains   and\\nby this conversion is rendered useful and profitable   or   on the other\\nhand   hurtful and useless   did you never observe the narrow\\nintelligence flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue—how eager he\\nis   how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end   he is the\\nreverse of blind   but his keen eye  sight is forced into the service of\\nevil   and he is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nbut what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days\\nof their youth   and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures  \\nsuch as eating and drinking   which   like leaden weights   were attached\\nto them at their birth   and which drag them down and turn the vision of\\ntheir souls upon the things that are below—if   i say   they had been\\nreleased from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction  \\nthe very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as\\nthey see what their eyes are turned to now  \\n\\nvery likely  \\n\\nyes   i said   and there is another thing which is likely   or rather a\\nnecessary inference from what has preceded   that neither the uneducated\\nand uninformed of the truth   nor yet those who never make an end of\\ntheir education   will be able ministers of state   not the former  \\nbecause they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their\\nactions   private as well as public   nor the latter   because they will\\nnot act at all except upon compulsion   fancying that they are already\\ndwelling apart in the islands of the blest  \\n\\nvery true   he replied  \\n\\nthen   i said   the business of us who are the founders of the state will\\nbe to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have\\nalready shown to be the greatest of all—they must continue to ascend\\nuntil they arrive at the good   but when they have ascended and seen\\nenough we must not allow them to do as they do now  \\n\\nwhat do you mean  \\n\\ni mean that they remain in the upper world   but this must not be\\nallowed   they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the\\nden   and partake of their labours and honours   whether they are worth\\nhaving or not  \\n\\nbut is not this unjust   he said   ought we to give them a worse life  \\nwhen they might have a better  \\n\\nyou have again forgotten   my friend   i said   the intention of the\\nlegislator   who did not aim at making any one class in the state happy\\nabove the rest   the happiness was to be in the whole state   and he held\\nthe citizens together by persuasion and necessity   making them\\nbenefactors of the state   and therefore benefactors of one another   to\\nthis end he created them   not to please themselves   but to be his\\ninstruments in binding up the state  \\n\\ntrue   he said   i had forgotten  \\n\\nobserve   glaucon   that there will be no injustice in compelling our\\nphilosophers to have a care and providence of others   we shall explain\\nto them that in other states   men of their class are not obliged to\\nshare in the toils of politics   and this is reasonable   for they grow\\nup at their own sweet will   and the government would rather not have\\nthem   being self  taught   they cannot be expected to show any gratitude\\nfor a culture which they have never received   but we have brought you\\ninto the world to be rulers of the hive   kings of yourselves and of the\\nother citizens   and have educated you far better and more perfectly\\nthan they have been educated   and you are better able to share in the\\ndouble duty   wherefore each of you   when his turn comes   must go down\\nto the general underground abode   and get the habit of seeing in the\\ndark   when you have acquired the habit   you will see ten thousand times\\nbetter than the inhabitants of the den   and you will know what the\\nseveral images are   and what they represent   because you have seen the\\nbeautiful and just and good in their truth   and thus our state   which\\nis also yours   will be a reality   and not a dream only   and will be\\nadministered in a spirit unlike that of other states   in which men\\nfight with one another about shadows only and are distracted in the\\nstruggle for power   which in their eyes is a great good   whereas the\\ntruth is that the state in which the rulers are most reluctant to\\ngovern is always the best and most quietly governed   and the state in\\nwhich they are most eager   the worst  \\n\\nquite true   he replied  \\n\\nand will our pupils   when they hear this   refuse to take their turn at\\nthe toils of state   when they are allowed to spend the greater part of\\ntheir time with one another in the heavenly light  \\n\\nimpossible   he answered   for they are just men   and the commands which\\nwe impose upon them are just   there can be no doubt that every one of\\nthem will take office as a stern necessity   and not after the fashion\\nof our present rulers of state  \\n\\nyes   my friend   i said   and there lies the point   you must contrive for\\nyour future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler   and\\nthen you may have a well  ordered state   for only in the state which\\noffers this   will they rule who are truly rich   not in silver and gold  \\nbut in virtue and wisdom   which are the true blessings of life   whereas\\nif they go to the administration of public affairs   poor and hungering\\nafter their own private advantage   thinking that hence they are to\\nsnatch the chief good   order there can never be   for they will be\\nfighting about office   and the civil and domestic broils which thus\\narise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole state  \\n\\nmost true   he replied  \\n\\nand the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition\\nis that of true philosophy   do you know of any other  \\n\\nindeed   i do not   he said  \\n\\nand those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task   for   if they\\nare   there will be rival lovers   and they will fight  \\n\\nno question  \\n\\nwho then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians   surely they\\nwill be the men who are wisest about affairs of state   and by whom the\\nstate is best administered   and who at the same time have other honours\\nand another and a better life than that of politics  \\n\\nthey are the men   and i will choose them   he replied  \\n\\nand now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced  \\nand how they are to be brought from darkness to light  —as some are said\\nto have ascended from the world below to the gods  \\n\\nby all means   he replied  \\n\\nthe process   i said   is not the turning over of an oyster  shell   in\\nallusion to a game in which two parties fled or pursued according as an\\noyster  shell which was thrown into the air fell with the dark or light\\nside uppermost       but the turning round of a soul passing from a day\\nwhich is little better than night to the true day of being   that is  \\nthe ascent from below   which we affirm to be true philosophy  \\n\\nquite so  \\n\\nand should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of\\neffecting such a change  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nwhat sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming\\nto being   and another consideration has just occurred to me   you will\\nremember that our young men are to be warrior athletes  \\n\\nyes   that was said  \\n\\nthen this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality  \\n\\nwhat quality  \\n\\nusefulness in war  \\n\\nyes   if possible  \\n\\nthere were two parts in our former scheme of education   were there not  \\n\\njust so  \\n\\nthere was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the\\nbody   and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and\\ncorruption  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthen that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover  \\n\\nno  \\n\\nbut what do you say of music   which also entered to a certain extent\\ninto our former scheme  \\n\\nmusic   he said   as you will remember   was the counterpart of gymnastic  \\nand trained the guardians by the influences of habit   by harmony making\\nthem harmonious   by rhythm rhythmical   but not giving them science   and\\nthe words   whether fabulous or possibly true   had kindred elements of\\nrhythm and harmony in them   but in music there was nothing which tended\\nto that good which you are now seeking  \\n\\nyou are most accurate   i said   in your recollection   in music there\\ncertainly was nothing of the kind   but what branch of knowledge is\\nthere   my dear glaucon   which is of the desired nature   since all the\\nuseful arts were reckoned mean by us  \\n\\nundoubtedly   and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded   and the arts\\nare also excluded   what remains  \\n\\nwell   i said   there may be nothing left of our special subjects   and\\nthen we shall have to take something which is not special   but of\\nuniversal application  \\n\\nwhat may that be  \\n\\na something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in\\ncommon   and which every one first has to learn among the elements of\\neducation  \\n\\nwhat is that  \\n\\nthe little matter of distinguishing one   two   and three—in a word  \\nnumber and calculation  —do not all arts and sciences necessarily\\npartake of them  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthen the art of war partakes of them  \\n\\nto be sure  \\n\\nthen palamedes   whenever he appears in tragedy   proves agamemnon\\nridiculously unfit to be a general   did you never remark how he\\ndeclares that he had invented number   and had numbered the ships and\\nset in array the ranks of the army at troy   which implies that they had\\nnever been numbered before   and agamemnon must be supposed literally to\\nhave been incapable of counting his own feet—how could he if he was\\nignorant of number   and if that is true   what sort of general must he\\nhave been  \\n\\ni should say a very strange one   if this was as you say  \\n\\ncan we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic  \\n\\ncertainly he should   if he is to have the smallest understanding of\\nmilitary tactics   or indeed   i should rather say   if he is to be a man\\nat all  \\n\\ni should like to know whether you have the same notion which i have of\\nthis study  \\n\\nwhat is your notion  \\n\\nit appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking   and\\nwhich leads naturally to reflection   but never to have been rightly\\nused   for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being  \\n\\nwill you explain your meaning   he said  \\n\\ni will try   i said   and i wish you would share the enquiry with me   and\\nsay   yes   or   no   when i attempt to distinguish in my own mind what\\nbranches of knowledge have this attracting power   in order that we may\\nhave clearer proof that arithmetic is   as i suspect   one of them  \\n\\nexplain   he said  \\n\\ni mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds   some of them do\\nnot invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them  \\nwhile in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that\\nfurther enquiry is imperatively demanded  \\n\\nyou are clearly referring   he said   to the manner in which the senses\\nare imposed upon by distance   and by painting in light and shade  \\n\\nno   i said   that is not at all my meaning  \\n\\nthen what is your meaning  \\n\\nwhen speaking of uninviting objects   i mean those which do not pass\\nfrom one sensation to the opposite   inviting objects are those which\\ndo   in this latter case the sense coming upon the object   whether at a\\ndistance or near   gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular\\nthan of its opposite   an illustration will make my meaning\\nclearer  —here are three fingers—a little finger   a second finger   and a\\nmiddle finger  \\n\\nvery good  \\n\\nyou may suppose that they are seen quite close   and here comes the\\npoint  \\n\\nwhat is it  \\n\\neach of them equally appears a finger   whether seen in the middle or at\\nthe extremity   whether white or black   or thick or thin—it makes no\\ndifference   a finger is a finger all the same   in these cases a man is\\nnot compelled to ask of thought the question what is a finger   for the\\nsight never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand therefore   i said   as we might expect   there is nothing here which\\ninvites or excites intelligence  \\n\\nthere is not   he said  \\n\\nbut is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers  \\ncan sight adequately perceive them   and is no difference made by the\\ncircumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at\\nthe extremity   and in like manner does the touch adequately perceive\\nthe qualities of thickness or thinness   of softness or hardness   and so\\nof the other senses   do they give perfect intimations of such matters  \\nis not their mode of operation on this wise—the sense which is\\nconcerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also\\nwith the quality of softness   and only intimates to the soul that the\\nsame thing is felt to be both hard and soft  \\n\\nyou are quite right   he said  \\n\\nand must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense\\ngives of a hard which is also soft   what   again   is the meaning of\\nlight and heavy   if that which is light is also heavy   and that which\\nis heavy   light  \\n\\nyes   he said   these intimations which the soul receives are very\\ncurious and require to be explained  \\n\\nyes   i said   and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons to\\nher aid calculation and intelligence   that she may see whether the\\nseveral objects announced to her are one or two  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand if they turn out to be two   is not each of them one and different  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand if each is one   and both are two   she will conceive the two as in a\\nstate of division   for if there were undivided they could only be\\nconceived of as one  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthe eye certainly did see both small and great   but only in a confused\\nmanner   they were not distinguished  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nwhereas the thinking mind   intending to light up the chaos   was\\ncompelled to reverse the process   and look at small and great as\\nseparate and not confused  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nwas not this the beginning of the enquiry   what is great     and   what is\\nsmall    \\n\\nexactly so  \\n\\nand thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible  \\n\\nmost true  \\n\\nthis was what i meant when i spoke of impressions which invited the\\nintellect   or the reverse—those which are simultaneous with opposite\\nimpressions   invite thought   those which are not simultaneous do not  \\n\\ni understand   he said   and agree with you  \\n\\nand to which class do unity and number belong  \\n\\ni do not know   he replied  \\n\\nthink a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply the\\nanswer   for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the sight\\nor by any other sense   then   as we were saying in the case of the\\nfinger   there would be nothing to attract towards being   but when there\\nis some contradiction always present   and one is the reverse of one and\\ninvolves the conception of plurality   then thought begins to be aroused\\nwithin us   and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision\\nasks   what is absolute unity     this is the way in which the study of\\nthe one has a power of drawing and converting the mind to the\\ncontemplation of true being  \\n\\nand surely   he said   this occurs notably in the case of one   for we see\\nthe same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude  \\n\\nyes   i said   and this being true of one must be equally true of all\\nnumber  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand they appear to lead the mind towards truth  \\n\\nyes   in a very remarkable manner  \\n\\nthen this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking   having a\\ndouble use   military and philosophical   for the man of war must learn\\nthe art of number or he will not know how to array his troops   and the\\nphilosopher also   because he has to rise out of the sea of change and\\nlay hold of true being   and therefore he must be an arithmetician  \\n\\nthat is true  \\n\\nand our guardian is both warrior and philosopher  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nthen this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe  \\nand we must endeavour to persuade those who are to be the principal men\\nof our state to go and learn arithmetic   not as amateurs   but they must\\ncarry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind\\nonly   nor again   like merchants or retail  traders   with a view to\\nbuying or selling   but for the sake of their military use   and of the\\nsoul herself   and because this will be the easiest way for her to pass\\nfrom becoming to truth and being  \\n\\nthat is excellent   he said  \\n\\nyes   i said   and now having spoken of it   i must add how charming the\\nscience is   and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end   if\\npursued in the spirit of a philosopher   and not of a shopkeeper  \\n\\nhow do you mean  \\n\\ni mean   as i was saying   that arithmetic has a very great and elevating\\neffect   compelling the soul to reason about abstract number   and\\nrebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into\\nthe argument   you know how steadily the masters of the art repel and\\nridicule any one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is\\ncalculating   and if you divide   they multiply   meaning either   1   that\\nthey integrate the number because they deny the possibility of\\nfractions   or   2   that division is regarded by them as a process of\\nmultiplication   for the fractions of one continue to be units       taking\\ncare that one shall continue one and not become lost in fractions  \\n\\nthat is very true  \\n\\nnow   suppose a person were to say to them   o my friends   what are these\\nwonderful numbers about which you are reasoning   in which   as you say  \\nthere is a unity such as you demand   and each unit is equal  \\ninvariable   indivisible  —what would they answer  \\n\\nthey would answer   as i should conceive   that they were speaking of\\nthose numbers which can only be realized in thought  \\n\\nthen you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary  \\nnecessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in\\nthe attainment of pure truth  \\n\\nyes   that is a marked characteristic of it  \\n\\nand have you further observed   that those who have a natural talent for\\ncalculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge   and\\neven the dull   if they have had an arithmetical training   although they\\nmay derive no other advantage from it   always become much quicker than\\nthey would otherwise have been  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nand indeed   you will not easily find a more difficult study   and not\\nmany as difficult  \\n\\nyou will not  \\n\\nand   for all these reasons   arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which\\nthe best natures should be trained   and which must not be given up  \\n\\ni agree  \\n\\nlet this then be made one of our subjects of education   and next   shall\\nwe enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us  \\n\\nyou mean geometry  \\n\\nexactly so  \\n\\nclearly   he said   we are concerned with that part of geometry which\\nrelates to war   for in pitching a camp   or taking up a position   or\\nclosing or extending the lines of an army   or any other military\\nmanoeuvre   whether in actual battle or on a march   it will make all the\\ndifference whether a general is or is not a geometrician  \\n\\nyes   i said   but for that purpose a very little of either geometry or\\ncalculation will be enough   the question relates rather to the greater\\nand more advanced part of geometry—whether that tends in any degree to\\nmake more easy the vision of the idea of good   and thither   as i was\\nsaying   all things tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze towards\\nthat place   where is the full perfection of being   which she ought   by\\nall means   to behold  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nthen if geometry compels us to view being   it concerns us   if becoming\\nonly   it does not concern us  \\n\\nyes   that is what we assert  \\n\\nyet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not deny\\nthat such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the\\nordinary language of geometricians  \\n\\nhow so  \\n\\nthey have in view practice only   and are always speaking   in a narrow\\nand ridiculous manner   of squaring and extending and applying and the\\nlike—they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life  \\nwhereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science  \\n\\ncertainly   he said  \\n\\nthen must not a further admission be made  \\n\\nwhat admission  \\n\\nthat the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal  \\nand not of aught perishing and transient  \\n\\nthat   he replied   may be readily allowed   and is true  \\n\\nthen   my noble friend   geometry will draw the soul towards truth   and\\ncreate the spirit of philosophy   and raise up that which is now\\nunhappily allowed to fall down  \\n\\nnothing will be more likely to have such an effect  \\n\\nthen nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants\\nof your fair city should by all means learn geometry   moreover the\\nscience has indirect effects   which are not small  \\n\\nof what kind   he said  \\n\\nthere are the military advantages of which you spoke   i said   and in\\nall departments of knowledge   as experience proves   any one who has\\nstudied geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has\\nnot  \\n\\nyes indeed   he said   there is an infinite difference between them  \\n\\nthen shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our\\nyouth will study  \\n\\nlet us do so   he replied  \\n\\nand suppose we make astronomy the third—what do you say  \\n\\ni am strongly inclined to it   he said   the observation of the seasons\\nand of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the\\nfarmer or sailor  \\n\\ni am amused   i said   at your fear of the world   which makes you guard\\nagainst the appearance of insisting upon useless studies   and i quite\\nadmit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye of\\nthe soul which   when by other pursuits lost and dimmed   is by these\\npurified and re  illumined   and is more precious far than ten thousand\\nbodily eyes   for by it alone is truth seen   now there are two classes\\nof persons   one class of those who will agree with you and will take\\nyour words as a revelation   another class to whom they will be utterly\\nunmeaning   and who will naturally deem them to be idle tales   for they\\nsee no sort of profit which is to be obtained from them   and therefore\\nyou had better decide at once with which of the two you are proposing\\nto argue   you will very likely say with neither   and that your chief\\naim in carrying on the argument is your own improvement   at the same\\ntime you do not grudge to others any benefit which they may receive  \\n\\ni think that i should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my own\\nbehalf  \\n\\nthen take a step backward   for we have gone wrong in the order of the\\nsciences  \\n\\nwhat was the mistake   he said  \\n\\nafter plane geometry   i said   we proceeded at once to solids in\\nrevolution   instead of taking solids in themselves   whereas after the\\nsecond dimension the third   which is concerned with cubes and\\ndimensions of depth   ought to have followed  \\n\\nthat is true   socrates   but so little seems to be known as yet about\\nthese subjects  \\n\\nwhy   yes   i said   and for two reasons  —in the first place   no\\ngovernment patronises them   this leads to a want of energy in the\\npursuit of them   and they are difficult   in the second place   students\\ncannot learn them unless they have a director   but then a director can\\nhardly be found   and even if he could   as matters now stand   the\\nstudents   who are very conceited   would not attend to him   that  \\nhowever   would be otherwise if the whole state became the director of\\nthese studies and gave honour to them   then disciples would want to\\ncome   and there would be continuous and earnest search   and discoveries\\nwould be made   since even now   disregarded as they are by the world  \\nand maimed of their fair proportions   and although none of their\\nvotaries can tell the use of them   still these studies force their way\\nby their natural charm   and very likely   if they had the help of the\\nstate   they would some day emerge into light  \\n\\nyes   he said   there is a remarkable charm in them   but i do not clearly\\nunderstand the change in the order   first you began with a geometry of\\nplane surfaces  \\n\\nyes   i said  \\n\\nand you placed astronomy next   and then you made a step backward  \\n\\nyes   and i have delayed you by my hurry   the ludicrous state of solid\\ngeometry   which   in natural order   should have followed   made me pass\\nover this branch and go on to astronomy   or motion of solids  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nthen assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence if\\nencouraged by the state   let us go on to astronomy   which will be\\nfourth  \\n\\nthe right order   he replied   and now   socrates   as you rebuked the\\nvulgar manner in which i praised astronomy before   my praise shall be\\ngiven in your own spirit   for every one   as i think   must see that\\nastronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world\\nto another  \\n\\nevery one but myself   i said   to every one else this may be clear   but\\nnot to me  \\n\\nand what then would you say  \\n\\ni should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy\\nappear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards  \\n\\nwhat do you mean   he asked  \\n\\nyou   i replied   have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our\\nknowledge of the things above   and i dare say that if a person were to\\nthrow his head back and study the fretted ceiling   you would still\\nthink that his mind was the percipient   and not his eyes   and you are\\nvery likely right   and i may be a simpleton   but   in my opinion   that\\nknowledge only which is of being and of the unseen can make the soul\\nlook upwards   and whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks on the\\nground   seeking to learn some particular of sense   i would deny that he\\ncan learn   for nothing of that sort is matter of science   his soul is\\nlooking downwards   not upwards   whether his way to knowledge is by\\nwater or by land   whether he floats   or only lies on his back  \\n\\ni acknowledge   he said   the justice of your rebuke   still   i should\\nlike to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more\\nconducive to that knowledge of which we are speaking  \\n\\ni will tell you   i said   the starry heaven which we behold is wrought\\nupon a visible ground   and therefore   although the fairest and most\\nperfect of visible things   must necessarily be deemed inferior far to\\nthe true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness   which are\\nrelative to each other   and carry with them that which is contained in\\nthem   in the true number and in every true figure   now   these are to be\\napprehended by reason and intelligence   but not by sight  \\n\\ntrue   he replied  \\n\\nthe spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to\\nthat higher knowledge   their beauty is like the beauty of figures or\\npictures excellently wrought by the hand of daedalus   or some other\\ngreat artist   which we may chance to behold   any geometrician who saw\\nthem would appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship   but he\\nwould never dream of thinking that in them he could find the true equal\\nor the true double   or the truth of any other proportion  \\n\\nno   he replied   such an idea would be ridiculous  \\n\\nand will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at\\nthe movements of the stars   will he not think that heaven and the\\nthings in heaven are framed by the creator of them in the most perfect\\nmanner   but he will never imagine that the proportions of night and\\nday   or of both to the month   or of the month to the year   or of the\\nstars to these and to one another   and any other things that are\\nmaterial and visible can also be eternal and subject to no\\ndeviation—that would be absurd   and it is equally absurd to take so\\nmuch pains in investigating their exact truth  \\n\\ni quite agree   though i never thought of this before  \\n\\nthen   i said   in astronomy   as in geometry   we should employ problems  \\nand let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right\\nway and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real use  \\n\\nthat   he said   is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers  \\n\\nyes   i said   and there are many other things which must also have a\\nsimilar extension given to them   if our legislation is to be of any\\nvalue   but can you tell me of any other suitable study  \\n\\nno   he said   not without thinking  \\n\\nmotion   i said   has many forms   and not one only   two of them are\\nobvious enough even to wits no better than ours   and there are others  \\nas i imagine   which may be left to wiser persons  \\n\\nbut where are the two  \\n\\nthere is a second   i said   which is the counterpart of the one already\\nnamed  \\n\\nand what may that be  \\n\\nthe second   i said   would seem relatively to the ears to be what the\\nfirst is to the eyes   for i conceive that as the eyes are designed to\\nlook up at the stars   so are the ears to hear harmonious motions   and\\nthese are sister sciences—as the pythagoreans say   and we   glaucon  \\nagree with them  \\n\\nyes   he replied  \\n\\nbut this   i said   is a laborious study   and therefore we had better go\\nand learn of them   and they will tell us whether there are any other\\napplications of these sciences   at the same time   we must not lose\\nsight of our own higher object  \\n\\nwhat is that  \\n\\nthere is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach   and which our\\npupils ought also to attain   and not to fall short of   as i was saying\\nthat they did in astronomy   for in the science of harmony   as you\\nprobably know   the same thing happens   the teachers of harmony compare\\nthe sounds and consonances which are heard only   and their labour   like\\nthat of the astronomers   is in vain  \\n\\nyes   by heaven   he said   and   tis as good as a play to hear them\\ntalking about their condensed notes   as they call them   they put their\\nears close alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from\\ntheir neighbour  s wall—one set of them declaring that they distinguish\\nan intermediate note and have found the least interval which should be\\nthe unit of measurement   the others insisting that the two sounds have\\npassed into the same—either party setting their ears before their\\nunderstanding  \\n\\nyou mean   i said   those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and\\nrack them on the pegs of the instrument   i might carry on the metaphor\\nand speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives   and\\nmake accusations against the strings   both of backwardness and\\nforwardness to sound   but this would be tedious   and therefore i will\\nonly say that these are not the men   and that i am referring to the\\npythagoreans   of whom i was just now proposing to enquire about\\nharmony   for they too are in error   like the astronomers   they\\ninvestigate the numbers of the harmonies which are heard   but they\\nnever attain to problems—that is to say   they never reach the natural\\nharmonies of number   or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and\\nothers not  \\n\\nthat   he said   is a thing of more than mortal knowledge  \\n\\na thing   i replied   which i would rather call useful   that is   if\\nsought after with a view to the beautiful and good   but if pursued in\\nany other spirit   useless  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nnow   when all these studies reach the point of inter  communion and\\nconnection with one another   and come to be considered in their mutual\\naffinities   then   i think   but not till then   will the pursuit of them\\nhave a value for our objects   otherwise there is no profit in them  \\n\\ni suspect so   but you are speaking   socrates   of a vast work  \\n\\nwhat do you mean   i said   the prelude or what   do you not know that all\\nthis is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn  \\nfor you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a\\ndialectician  \\n\\nassuredly not   he said   i have hardly ever known a mathematician who\\nwas capable of reasoning  \\n\\nbut do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason\\nwill have the knowledge which we require of them  \\n\\nneither can this be supposed  \\n\\nand so   glaucon   i said   we have at last arrived at the hymn of\\ndialectic   this is that strain which is of the intellect only   but\\nwhich the faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate   for\\nsight   as you may remember   was imagined by us after a while to behold\\nthe real animals and stars   and last of all the sun himself   and so\\nwith dialectic   when a person starts on the discovery of the absolute\\nby the light of reason only   and without any assistance of sense   and\\nperseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives at the perception of\\nthe absolute good   he at last finds himself at the end of the\\nintellectual world   as in the case of sight at the end of the visible  \\n\\nexactly   he said  \\n\\nthen this is the progress which you call dialectic  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nbut the release of the prisoners from chains   and their translation\\nfrom the shadows to the images and to the light   and the ascent from\\nthe underground den to the sun   while in his presence they are vainly\\ntrying to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun   but are\\nable to perceive even with their weak eyes the images in the water\\n  which are divine     and are the shadows of true existence   not shadows\\nof images cast by a light of fire   which compared with the sun is only\\nan image  —this power of elevating the highest principle in the soul to\\nthe contemplation of that which is best in existence   with which we may\\ncompare the raising of that faculty which is the very light of the body\\nto the sight of that which is brightest in the material and visible\\nworld—this power is given   as i was saying   by all that study and\\npursuit of the arts which has been described  \\n\\ni agree in what you are saying   he replied   which may be hard to\\nbelieve   yet   from another point of view   is harder still to deny  \\nthis   however   is not a theme to be treated of in passing only   but\\nwill have to be discussed again and again   and so   whether our\\nconclusion be true or false   let us assume all this   and proceed at\\nonce from the prelude or preamble to the chief strain   a play upon the\\ngreek word   which means both   law   and   strain         and describe that in\\nlike manner   say   then   what is the nature and what are the divisions\\nof dialectic   and what are the paths which lead thither   for these\\npaths will also lead to our final rest  \\n\\ndear glaucon   i said   you will not be able to follow me here   though i\\nwould do my best   and you should behold not an image only but the\\nabsolute truth   according to my notion   whether what i told you would\\nor would not have been a reality i cannot venture to say   but you would\\nhave seen something like reality   of that i am confident  \\n\\ndoubtless   he replied  \\n\\nbut i must also remind you   that the power of dialectic alone can\\nreveal this   and only to one who is a disciple of the previous\\nsciences  \\n\\nof that assertion you may be as confident as of the last  \\n\\nand assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of\\ncomprehending by any regular process all true existence or of\\nascertaining what each thing is in its own nature   for the arts in\\ngeneral are concerned with the desires or opinions of men   or are\\ncultivated with a view to production and construction   or for the\\npreservation of such productions and constructions   and as to the\\nmathematical sciences which   as we were saying   have some apprehension\\nof true being—geometry and the like—they only dream about being   but\\nnever can they behold the waking reality so long as they leave the\\nhypotheses which they use unexamined   and are unable to give an account\\nof them   for when a man knows not his own first principle   and when the\\nconclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows\\nnot what   how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever\\nbecome science  \\n\\nimpossible   he said  \\n\\nthen dialectic   and dialectic alone   goes directly to the first\\nprinciple and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in\\norder to make her ground secure   the eye of the soul   which is\\nliterally buried in an outlandish slough   is by her gentle aid lifted\\nupwards   and she uses as handmaids and helpers in the work of\\nconversion   the sciences which we have been discussing   custom terms\\nthem sciences   but they ought to have some other name   implying greater\\nclearness than opinion and less clearness than science   and this   in\\nour previous sketch   was called understanding   but why should we\\ndispute about names when we have realities of such importance to\\nconsider  \\n\\nwhy indeed   he said   when any name will do which expresses the thought\\nof the mind with clearness  \\n\\nat any rate   we are satisfied   as before   to have four divisions   two\\nfor intellect and two for opinion   and to call the first division\\nscience   the second understanding   the third belief   and the fourth\\nperception of shadows   opinion being concerned with becoming   and\\nintellect with being   and so to make a proportion  —\\n\\nas being is to becoming   so is pure intellect to opinion   and as\\nintellect is to opinion   so is science to belief   and understanding to\\nthe perception of shadows  \\n\\nbut let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the\\nsubjects of opinion and of intellect   for it will be a long enquiry  \\nmany times longer than this has been  \\n\\nas far as i understand   he said   i agree  \\n\\nand do you also agree   i said   in describing the dialectician as one\\nwho attains a conception of the essence of each thing   and he who does\\nnot possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception   in\\nwhatever degree he fails   may in that degree also be said to fail in\\nintelligence   will you admit so much  \\n\\nyes   he said   how can i deny it  \\n\\nand you would say the same of the conception of the good   until the\\nperson is able to abstract and define rationally the idea of good   and\\nunless he can run the gauntlet of all objections   and is ready to\\ndisprove them   not by appeals to opinion   but to absolute truth   never\\nfaltering at any step of the argument—unless he can do all this   you\\nwould say that he knows neither the idea of good nor any other good   he\\napprehends only a shadow   if anything at all   which is given by opinion\\nand not by science  —dreaming and slumbering in this life   before he is\\nwell awake here   he arrives at the world below   and has his final\\nquietus  \\n\\nin all that i should most certainly agree with you  \\n\\nand surely you would not have the children of your ideal state   whom\\nyou are nurturing and educating—if the ideal ever becomes a reality—you\\nwould not allow the future rulers to be like posts   literally   lines    \\nprobably the starting  point of a race  course       having no reason in\\nthem   and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nthen you will make a law that they shall have such an education as will\\nenable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering\\nquestions  \\n\\nyes   he said   you and i together will make it  \\n\\ndialectic   then   as you will agree   is the coping  stone of the\\nsciences   and is set over them   no other science can be placed\\nhigher—the nature of knowledge can no further go  \\n\\ni agree   he said  \\n\\nbut to whom we are to assign these studies   and in what way they are to\\nbe assigned   are questions which remain to be considered  \\n\\nyes   clearly  \\n\\nyou remember   i said   how the rulers were chosen before  \\n\\ncertainly   he said  \\n\\nthe same natures must still be chosen   and the preference again given\\nto the surest and the bravest   and   if possible   to the fairest   and  \\nhaving noble and generous tempers   they should also have the natural\\ngifts which will facilitate their education  \\n\\nand what are these  \\n\\nsuch gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition   for the mind\\nmore often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of\\ngymnastics   the toil is more entirely the mind  s own   and is not shared\\nwith the body  \\n\\nvery true   he replied  \\n\\nfurther   he of whom we are in search should have a good memory   and be\\nan unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line   or he will\\nnever be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go\\nthrough all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of\\nhim  \\n\\ncertainly   he said   he must have natural gifts  \\n\\nthe mistake at present is   that those who study philosophy have no\\nvocation   and this   as i was before saying   is the reason why she has\\nfallen into disrepute   her true sons should take her by the hand and\\nnot bastards  \\n\\nwhat do you mean  \\n\\nin the first place   her votary should not have a lame or halting\\nindustry—i mean   that he should not be half industrious and half idle  \\nas   for example   when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting   and\\nall other bodily exercises   but a hater rather than a lover of the\\nlabour of learning or listening or enquiring   or the occupation to\\nwhich he devotes himself may be of an opposite kind   and he may have\\nthe other sort of lameness  \\n\\ncertainly   he said  \\n\\nand as to truth   i said   is not a soul equally to be deemed halt and\\nlame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at\\nherself and others when they tell lies   but is patient of involuntary\\nfalsehood   and does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire\\nof ignorance   and has no shame at being detected  \\n\\nto be sure  \\n\\nand   again   in respect of temperance   courage   magnificence   and every\\nother virtue   should we not carefully distinguish between the true son\\nand the bastard   for where there is no discernment of such qualities\\nstates and individuals unconsciously err   and the state makes a ruler  \\nand the individual a friend   of one who   being defective in some part\\nof virtue   is in a figure lame or a bastard  \\n\\nthat is very true   he said  \\n\\nall these things   then   will have to be carefully considered by us   and\\nif only those whom we introduce to this vast system of education and\\ntraining are sound in body and mind   justice herself will have nothing\\nto say against us   and we shall be the saviours of the constitution and\\nof the state   but   if our pupils are men of another stamp   the reverse\\nwill happen   and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule on\\nphilosophy than she has to endure at present  \\n\\nthat would not be creditable  \\n\\ncertainly not   i said   and yet perhaps   in thus turning jest into\\nearnest i am equally ridiculous  \\n\\nin what respect  \\n\\ni had forgotten   i said   that we were not serious   and spoke with too\\nmuch excitement   for when i saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled\\nunder foot of men i could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the\\nauthors of her disgrace   and my anger made me too vehement  \\n\\nindeed   i was listening   and did not think so  \\n\\nbut i   who am the speaker   felt that i was   and now let me remind you\\nthat   although in our former selection we chose old men   we must not do\\nso in this   solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he\\ngrows old may learn many things—for he can no more learn much than he\\ncan run much   youth is the time for any extraordinary toil  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nand   therefore   calculation and geometry and all the other elements of\\ninstruction   which are a preparation for dialectic   should be presented\\nto the mind in childhood   not   however   under any notion of forcing our\\nsystem of education  \\n\\nwhy not  \\n\\nbecause a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of\\nknowledge of any kind   bodily exercise   when compulsory   does no harm\\nto the body   but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains\\nno hold on the mind  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nthen   my good friend   i said   do not use compulsion   but let early\\neducation be a sort of amusement   you will then be better able to find\\nout the natural bent  \\n\\nthat is a very rational notion   he said  \\n\\ndo you remember that the children   too   were to be taken to see the\\nbattle on horseback   and that if there were no danger they were to be\\nbrought close up and   like young hounds   have a taste of blood given\\nthem  \\n\\nyes   i remember  \\n\\nthe same practice may be followed   i said   in all these things—labours  \\nlessons   dangers—and he who is most at home in all of them ought to be\\nenrolled in a select number  \\n\\nat what age  \\n\\nat the age when the necessary gymnastics are over   the period whether\\nof two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless\\nfor any other purpose   for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to\\nlearning   and the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one\\nof the most important tests to which our youth are subjected  \\n\\ncertainly   he replied  \\n\\nafter that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years\\nold will be promoted to higher honour   and the sciences which they\\nlearned without any order in their early education will now be brought\\ntogether   and they will be able to see the natural relationship of them\\nto one another and to true being  \\n\\nyes   he said   that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting\\nroot  \\n\\nyes   i said   and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion\\nof dialectical talent   the comprehensive mind is always the\\ndialectical  \\n\\ni agree with you   he said  \\n\\nthese   i said   are the points which you must consider   and those who\\nhave most of this comprehension   and who are most steadfast in their\\nlearning   and in their military and other appointed duties   when they\\nhave arrived at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of the\\nselect class   and elevated to higher honour   and you will have to prove\\nthem by the help of dialectic   in order to learn which of them is able\\nto give up the use of sight and the other senses   and in company with\\ntruth to attain absolute being   and here   my friend   great caution is\\nrequired  \\n\\nwhy great caution  \\n\\ndo you not remark   i said   how great is the evil which dialectic has\\nintroduced  \\n\\nwhat evil   he said  \\n\\nthe students of the art are filled with lawlessness  \\n\\nquite true   he said  \\n\\ndo you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in\\ntheir case   or will you make allowance for them  \\n\\nin what way make allowance  \\n\\ni want you   i said   by way of parallel   to imagine a supposititious son\\nwho is brought up in great wealth   he is one of a great and numerous\\nfamily   and has many flatterers   when he grows up to manhood   he learns\\nthat his alleged are not his real parents   but who the real are he is\\nunable to discover   can you guess how he will be likely to behave\\ntowards his flatterers and his supposed parents   first of all during\\nthe period when he is ignorant of the false relation   and then again\\nwhen he knows   or shall i guess for you  \\n\\nif you please  \\n\\nthen i should say   that while he is ignorant of the truth he will be\\nlikely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations\\nmore than the flatterers   he will be less inclined to neglect them when\\nin need   or to do or say anything against them   and he will be less\\nwilling to disobey them in any important matter  \\n\\nhe will  \\n\\nbut when he has made the discovery   i should imagine that he would\\ndiminish his honour and regard for them   and would become more devoted\\nto the flatterers   their influence over him would greatly increase   he\\nwould now live after their ways   and openly associate with them   and  \\nunless he were of an unusually good disposition   he would trouble\\nhimself no more about his supposed parents or other relations  \\n\\nwell   all that is very probable   but how is the image applicable to the\\ndisciples of philosophy  \\n\\nin this way   you know that there are certain principles about justice\\nand honour   which were taught us in childhood   and under their parental\\nauthority we have been brought up   obeying and honouring them  \\n\\nthat is true  \\n\\nthere are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter and\\nattract the soul   but do not influence those of us who have any sense\\nof right   and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their\\nfathers  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nnow   when a man is in this state   and the questioning spirit asks what\\nis fair or honourable   and he answers as the legislator has taught him  \\nand then arguments many and diverse refute his words   until he is\\ndriven into believing that nothing is honourable any more than\\ndishonourable   or just and good any more than the reverse   and so of\\nall the notions which he most valued   do you think that he will still\\nhonour and obey them as before  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nand when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore  \\nand he fails to discover the true   can he be expected to pursue any\\nlife other than that which flatters his desires  \\n\\nhe cannot  \\n\\nand from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of\\nit  \\n\\nunquestionably  \\n\\nnow all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as i have\\ndescribed   and also   as i was just now saying   most excusable  \\n\\nyes   he said   and   i may add   pitiable  \\n\\ntherefore   that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our\\ncitizens who are now thirty years of age   every care must be taken in\\nintroducing them to dialectic  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nthere is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early  \\nfor youngsters   as you may have observed   when they first get the taste\\nin their mouths   argue for amusement   and are always contradicting and\\nrefuting others in imitation of those who refute them   like puppy  dogs  \\nthey rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near them  \\n\\nyes   he said   there is nothing which they like better  \\n\\nand when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the\\nhands of many   they violently and speedily get into a way of not\\nbelieving anything which they believed before   and hence   not only\\nthey   but philosophy and all that relates to it is apt to have a bad\\nname with the rest of the world  \\n\\ntoo true   he said  \\n\\nbut when a man begins to get older   he will no longer be guilty of such\\ninsanity   he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth  \\nand not the eristic   who is contradicting for the sake of amusement  \\nand the greater moderation of his character will increase instead of\\ndiminishing the honour of the pursuit  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nand did we not make special provision for this   when we said that the\\ndisciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast   not   as now  \\nany chance aspirant or intruder  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nsuppose   i said   the study of philosophy to take the place of\\ngymnastics and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively\\nfor twice the number of years which were passed in bodily exercise—will\\nthat be enough  \\n\\nwould you say six or four years   he asked  \\n\\nsay five years   i replied   at the end of the time they must be sent\\ndown again into the den and compelled to hold any military or other\\noffice which young men are qualified to hold   in this way they will get\\ntheir experience of life   and there will be an opportunity of trying\\nwhether   when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation   they\\nwill stand firm or flinch  \\n\\nand how long is this stage of their lives to last  \\n\\nfifteen years   i answered   and when they have reached fifty years of\\nage   then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves\\nin every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at\\nlast to their consummation   the time has now arrived at which they must\\nraise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all\\nthings   and behold the absolute good   for that is the pattern according\\nto which they are to order the state and the lives of individuals   and\\nthe remainder of their own lives also   making philosophy their chief\\npursuit   but   when their turn comes   toiling also at politics and\\nruling for the public good   not as though they were performing some\\nheroic action   but simply as a matter of duty   and when they have\\nbrought up in each generation others like themselves and left them in\\ntheir place to be governors of the state   then they will depart to the\\nislands of the blest and dwell there   and the city will give them\\npublic memorials and sacrifices and honour them   if the pythian oracle\\nconsent   as demigods   but if not   as in any case blessed and divine  \\n\\nyou are a sculptor   socrates   and have made statues of our governors\\nfaultless in beauty  \\n\\nyes   i said   glaucon   and of our governesses too   for you must not\\nsuppose that what i have been saying applies to men only and not to\\nwomen as far as their natures can go  \\n\\nthere you are right   he said   since we have made them to share in all\\nthings like the men  \\n\\nwell   i said   and you would agree   would you not     that what has been\\nsaid about the state and the government is not a mere dream   and\\nalthough difficult not impossible   but only possible in the way which\\nhas been supposed   that is to say   when the true philosopher kings are\\nborn in a state   one or more of them   despising the honours of this\\npresent world which they deem mean and worthless   esteeming above all\\nthings right and the honour that springs from right   and regarding\\njustice as the greatest and most necessary of all things   whose\\nministers they are   and whose principles will be exalted by them when\\nthey set in order their own city  \\n\\nhow will they proceed  \\n\\nthey will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants of\\nthe city who are more than ten years old   and will take possession of\\ntheir children   who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents  \\nthese they will train in their own habits and laws   i mean in the laws\\nwhich we have given them   and in this way the state and constitution of\\nwhich we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness  \\nand the nation which has such a constitution will gain most  \\n\\nyes   that will be the best way   and i think   socrates   that you have\\nvery well described how   if ever   such a constitution might come into\\nbeing  \\n\\nenough then of the perfect state   and of the man who bears its\\nimage—there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him  \\n\\nthere is no difficulty   he replied   and i agree with you in thinking\\nthat nothing more need be said  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book viii  \\n\\n\\nand so   glaucon   we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect\\nstate wives and children are to be in common   and that all education\\nand the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common   and the best\\nphilosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings  \\n\\nthat   replied glaucon   has been acknowledged  \\n\\nyes   i said   and we have further acknowledged that the governors   when\\nappointed themselves   will take their soldiers and place them in houses\\nsuch as we were describing   which are common to all   and contain\\nnothing private   or individual   and about their property   you remember\\nwhat we agreed  \\n\\nyes   i remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions\\nof mankind   they were to be warrior athletes and guardians   receiving\\nfrom the other citizens   in lieu of annual payment   only their\\nmaintenance   and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole\\nstate  \\n\\ntrue   i said   and now that this division of our task is concluded   let\\nus find the point at which we digressed   that we may return into the\\nold path  \\n\\nthere is no difficulty in returning   you implied   then as now   that you\\nhad finished the description of the state   you said that such a state\\nwas good   and that the man was good who answered to it   although   as\\nnow appears   you had more excellent things to relate both of state and\\nman   and you said further   that if this was the true form   then the\\nothers were false   and of the false forms   you said   as i remember  \\nthat there were four principal ones   and that their defects   and the\\ndefects of the individuals corresponding to them   were worth examining  \\nwhen we had seen all the individuals   and finally agreed as to who was\\nthe best and who was the worst of them   we were to consider whether the\\nbest was not also the happiest   and the worst the most miserable   i\\nasked you what were the four forms of government of which you spoke  \\nand then polemarchus and adeimantus put in their word   and you began\\nagain   and have found your way to the point at which we have now\\narrived  \\n\\nyour recollection   i said   is most exact  \\n\\nthen   like a wrestler   he replied   you must put yourself again in the\\nsame position   and let me ask the same questions   and do you give me\\nthe same answer which you were about to give me then  \\n\\nyes   if i can   i will   i said  \\n\\ni shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions of\\nwhich you were speaking  \\n\\nthat question   i said   is easily answered   the four governments of\\nwhich i spoke   so far as they have distinct names   are   first   those of\\ncrete and sparta   which are generally applauded   what is termed\\noligarchy comes next   this is not equally approved   and is a form of\\ngovernment which teems with evils   thirdly   democracy   which naturally\\nfollows oligarchy   although very different   and lastly comes tyranny  \\ngreat and famous   which differs from them all   and is the fourth and\\nworst disorder of a state   i do not know   do you   of any other\\nconstitution which can be said to have a distinct character   there are\\nlordships and principalities which are bought and sold   and some other\\nintermediate forms of government   but these are nondescripts and may be\\nfound equally among hellenes and among barbarians  \\n\\nyes   he replied   we certainly hear of many curious forms of government\\nwhich exist among them  \\n\\ndo you know   i said   that governments vary as the dispositions of men\\nvary   and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the\\nother   for we cannot suppose that states are made of   oak and rock    \\nand not out of the human natures which are in them   and which in a\\nfigure turn the scale and draw other things after them  \\n\\nyes   he said   the states are as the men are   they grow out of human\\ncharacters  \\n\\nthen if the constitutions of states are five   the dispositions of\\nindividual minds will also be five  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nhim who answers to aristocracy   and whom we rightly call just and good  \\nwe have already described  \\n\\nwe have  \\n\\nthen let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures   being\\nthe contentious and ambitious   who answer to the spartan polity   also\\nthe oligarchical   democratical   and tyrannical   let us place the most\\njust by the side of the most unjust   and when we see them we shall be\\nable to compare the relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads\\na life of pure justice or pure injustice   the enquiry will then be\\ncompleted   and we shall know whether we ought to pursue injustice   as\\nthrasymachus advises   or in accordance with the conclusions of the\\nargument to prefer justice  \\n\\ncertainly   he replied   we must do as you say  \\n\\nshall we follow our old plan   which we adopted with a view to\\nclearness   of taking the state first and then proceeding to the\\nindividual   and begin with the government of honour  —i know of no name\\nfor such a government other than timocracy   or perhaps timarchy   we\\nwill compare with this the like character in the individual   and   after\\nthat   consider oligarchy and the oligarchical man   and then again we\\nwill turn our attention to democracy and the democratical man   and\\nlastly   we will go and view the city of tyranny   and once more take a\\nlook into the tyrant  s soul   and try to arrive at a satisfactory\\ndecision  \\n\\nthat way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very suitable  \\n\\nfirst   then   i said   let us enquire how timocracy   the government of\\nhonour   arises out of aristocracy   the government of the best    \\nclearly   all political changes originate in divisions of the actual\\ngoverning power   a government which is united   however small   cannot be\\nmoved  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nin what way   then   will our city be moved   and in what manner will the\\ntwo classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with\\none another   shall we   after the manner of homer   pray the muses to\\ntell us   how discord first arose     shall we imagine them in solemn\\nmockery   to play and jest with us as if we were children   and to\\naddress us in a lofty tragic vein   making believe to be in earnest  \\n\\nhow would they address us  \\n\\nafter this manner  —a city which is thus constituted can hardly be\\nshaken   but   seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an\\nend   even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever   but will\\nin time be dissolved   and this is the dissolution  —in plants that grow\\nin the earth   as well as in animals that move on the earth  s surface  \\nfertility and sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences\\nof the circles of each are completed   which in short  lived existences\\npass over a short space   and in long  lived ones over a long space   but\\nto the knowledge of human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom and\\neducation of your rulers will not attain   the laws which regulate them\\nwill not be discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed with sense  \\nbut will escape them   and they will bring children into the world when\\nthey ought not   now that which is of divine birth has a period which is\\ncontained in a perfect number   i  e   a cyclical number   such as 6   which\\nis equal to the sum of its divisors 1   2   3   so that when the circle or\\ntime represented by 6 is completed   the lesser times or rotations\\nrepresented by 1   2   3 are also completed       but the period of human\\nbirth is comprehended in a number in which first increments by\\ninvolution and evolution   or squared and cubed   obtaining three\\nintervals and four terms of like and unlike   waxing and waning numbers  \\nmake all the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another  \\n  probably the numbers 3   4   5   6 of which the three first = the sides\\nof the pythagorean triangle   the terms will then be 3 cubed   4 cubed   5\\ncubed   which together = 6 cubed = 216     the base of these   3   with a\\nthird added   4   when combined with five   20   and raised to the third\\npower furnishes two harmonies   the first a square which is a hundred\\ntimes as great   400 = 4 x 100     or the first a square which is 100 x\\n100 = 10  000   the whole number will then be 17  500 = a square of 100  \\nand an oblong of 100 by 75       and the other a figure having one side\\nequal to the former   but oblong   consisting of a hundred numbers\\nsquared upon rational diameters of a square   i  e   omitting fractions    \\nthe side of which is five   7 x 7 = 49 x 100 = 4900     each of them being\\nless by one   than the perfect square which includes the fractions   sc  \\n50   or less by   or     consisting of two numbers squared upon irrational\\ndiameters     etc   = 100   for other explanations of the passage see\\nintroduction     two perfect squares of irrational diameters   of a square\\nthe side of which is five = 50 + 50 = 100     and a hundred cubes of\\nthree   27 x 100 = 2700 + 4900 + 400 = 8000     now this number represents\\na geometrical figure which has control over the good and evil of\\nbirths   for when your guardians are ignorant of the law of births   and\\nunite bride and bridegroom out of season   the children will not be\\ngoodly or fortunate   and though only the best of them will be appointed\\nby their predecessors   still they will be unworthy to hold their\\nfathers   places   and when they come into power as guardians   they will\\nsoon be found to fail in taking care of us   the muses   first by\\nunder  valuing music   which neglect will soon extend to gymnastic   and\\nhence the young men of your state will be less cultivated   in the\\nsucceeding generation rulers will be appointed who have lost the\\nguardian power of testing the metal of your different races   which  \\nlike hesiod  s   are of gold and silver and brass and iron   and so iron\\nwill be mingled with silver   and brass with gold   and hence there will\\narise dissimilarity and inequality and irregularity   which always and\\nin all places are causes of hatred and war   this the muses affirm to be\\nthe stock from which discord has sprung   wherever arising   and this is\\ntheir answer to us  \\n\\nyes   and we may assume that they answer truly  \\n\\nwhy   yes   i said   of course they answer truly   how can the muses speak\\nfalsely  \\n\\nand what do the muses say next  \\n\\nwhen discord arose   then the two races were drawn different ways   the\\niron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and\\nsilver   but the gold and silver races   not wanting money but having the\\ntrue riches in their own nature   inclined towards virtue and the\\nancient order of things   there was a battle between them   and at last\\nthey agreed to distribute their land and houses among individual\\nowners   and they enslaved their friends and maintainers   whom they had\\nformerly protected in the condition of freemen   and made of them\\nsubjects and servants   and they themselves were engaged in war and in\\nkeeping a watch against them  \\n\\ni believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change  \\n\\nand the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate\\nbetween oligarchy and aristocracy  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nsuch will be the change   and after the change has been made   how will\\nthey proceed   clearly   the new state   being in a mean between oligarchy\\nand the perfect state   will partly follow one and partly the other   and\\nwill also have some peculiarities  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nin the honour given to rulers   in the abstinence of the warrior class\\nfrom agriculture   handicrafts   and trade in general   in the institution\\nof common meals   and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military\\ntraining—in all these respects this state will resemble the former  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nbut in the fear of admitting philosophers to power   because they are no\\nlonger to be had simple and earnest   but are made up of mixed elements  \\nand in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters   who\\nare by nature fitted for war rather than peace   and in the value set by\\nthem upon military stratagems and contrivances   and in the waging of\\neverlasting wars—this state will be for the most part peculiar  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nyes   i said   and men of this stamp will be covetous of money   like\\nthose who live in oligarchies   they will have   a fierce secret longing\\nafter gold and silver   which they will hoard in dark places   having\\nmagazines and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment\\nof them   also castles which are just nests for their eggs   and in which\\nthey will spend large sums on their wives   or on any others whom they\\nplease  \\n\\nthat is most true   he said  \\n\\nand they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring the\\nmoney which they prize   they will spend that which is another man  s on\\nthe gratification of their desires   stealing their pleasures and\\nrunning away like children from the law   their father   they have been\\nschooled not by gentle influences but by force   for they have neglected\\nher who is the true muse   the companion of reason and philosophy   and\\nhave honoured gymnastic more than music  \\n\\nundoubtedly   he said   the form of government which you describe is a\\nmixture of good and evil  \\n\\nwhy   there is a mixture   i said   but one thing   and one thing only   is\\npredominantly seen  —the spirit of contention and ambition   and these\\nare due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element  \\n\\nassuredly   he said  \\n\\nsuch is the origin and such the character of this state   which has been\\ndescribed in outline only   the more perfect execution was not required  \\nfor a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and\\nmost perfectly unjust   and to go through all the states and all the\\ncharacters of men   omitting none of them   would be an interminable\\nlabour  \\n\\nvery true   he replied  \\n\\nnow what man answers to this form of government  how did he come into\\nbeing   and what is he like  \\n\\ni think   said adeimantus   that in the spirit of contention which\\ncharacterises him   he is not unlike our friend glaucon  \\n\\nperhaps   i said   he may be like him in that one point   but there are\\nother respects in which he is very different  \\n\\nin what respects  \\n\\nhe should have more of self  assertion and be less cultivated   and yet a\\nfriend of culture   and he should be a good listener   but no speaker  \\nsuch a person is apt to be rough with slaves   unlike the educated man  \\nwho is too proud for that   and he will also be courteous to freemen  \\nand remarkably obedient to authority   he is a lover of power and a\\nlover of honour   claiming to be a ruler   not because he is eloquent   or\\non any ground of that sort   but because he is a soldier and has\\nperformed feats of arms   he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and\\nof the chase  \\n\\nyes   that is the type of character which answers to timocracy  \\n\\nsuch an one will despise riches only when he is young   but as he gets\\nolder he will be more and more attracted to them   because he has a\\npiece of the avaricious nature in him   and is not single  minded towards\\nvirtue   having lost his best guardian  \\n\\nwho was that   said adeimantus  \\n\\nphilosophy   i said   tempered with music   who comes and takes up her\\nabode in a man   and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life  \\n\\ngood   he said  \\n\\nsuch   i said   is the timocratical youth   and he is like the\\ntimocratical state  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nhis origin is as follows  —he is often the young son of a brave father  \\nwho dwells in an ill  governed city   of which he declines the honours\\nand offices   and will not go to law   or exert himself in any way   but\\nis ready to waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble  \\n\\nand how does the son come into being  \\n\\nthe character of the son begins to develope when he hears his mother\\ncomplaining that her husband has no place in the government   of which\\nthe consequence is that she has no precedence among other women  \\nfurther   when she sees her husband not very eager about money   and\\ninstead of battling and railing in the law courts or assembly   taking\\nwhatever happens to him quietly   and when she observes that his\\nthoughts always centre in himself   while he treats her with very\\nconsiderable indifference   she is annoyed   and says to her son that his\\nfather is only half a man and far too easy  going   adding all the other\\ncomplaints about her own ill  treatment which women are so fond of\\nrehearsing  \\n\\nyes   said adeimantus   they give us plenty of them   and their complaints\\nare so like themselves  \\n\\nand you know   i said   that the old servants also   who are supposed to\\nbe attached to the family   from time to time talk privately in the same\\nstrain to the son   and if they see any one who owes money to his\\nfather   or is wronging him in any way   and he fails to prosecute them  \\nthey tell the youth that when he grows up he must retaliate upon people\\nof this sort   and be more of a man than his father   he has only to walk\\nabroad and he hears and sees the same sort of thing   those who do their\\nown business in the city are called simpletons   and held in no esteem  \\nwhile the busy  bodies are honoured and applauded   the result is that\\nthe young man   hearing and seeing all these things—hearing   too   the\\nwords of his father   and having a nearer view of his way of life   and\\nmaking comparisons of him and others—is drawn opposite ways   while his\\nfather is watering and nourishing the rational principle in his soul  \\nthe others are encouraging the passionate and appetitive   and he being\\nnot originally of a bad nature   but having kept bad company   is at last\\nbrought by their joint influence to a middle point   and gives up the\\nkingdom which is within him to the middle principle of contentiousness\\nand passion   and becomes arrogant and ambitious  \\n\\nyou seem to me to have described his origin perfectly  \\n\\nthen we have now   i said   the second form of government and the second\\ntype of character  \\n\\nwe have  \\n\\nnext   let us look at another man who   as aeschylus says  \\n\\n  is set over against another state    \\n\\nor rather   as our plan requires   begin with the state  \\n\\nby all means  \\n\\ni believe that oligarchy follows next in order  \\n\\nand what manner of government do you term oligarchy  \\n\\na government resting on a valuation of property   in which the rich have\\npower and the poor man is deprived of it  \\n\\ni understand   he replied  \\n\\nought i not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to\\noligarchy arises  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nwell   i said   no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes\\ninto the other  \\n\\nhow  \\n\\nthe accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is the\\nruin of timocracy   they invent illegal modes of expenditure   for what\\ndo they or their wives care about the law  \\n\\nyes   indeed  \\n\\nand then one   seeing another grow rich   seeks to rival him   and thus\\nthe great mass of the citizens become lovers of money  \\n\\nlikely enough  \\n\\nand so they grow richer and richer   and the more they think of making a\\nfortune the less they think of virtue   for when riches and virtue are\\nplaced together in the scales of the balance   the one always rises as\\nthe other falls  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the state  \\nvirtue and the virtuous are dishonoured  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nand what is honoured is cultivated   and that which has no honour is\\nneglected  \\n\\nthat is obvious  \\n\\nand so at last   instead of loving contention and glory   men become\\nlovers of trade and money   they honour and look up to the rich man   and\\nmake a ruler of him   and dishonour the poor man  \\n\\nthey do so  \\n\\nthey next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the\\nqualification of citizenship   the sum is higher in one place and lower\\nin another   as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive   and they allow\\nno one whose property falls below the amount fixed to have any share in\\nthe government   these changes in the constitution they effect by force\\nof arms   if intimidation has not already done their work  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand this   speaking generally   is the way in which oligarchy is\\nestablished  \\n\\nyes   he said   but what are the characteristics of this form of\\ngovernment   and what are the defects of which we were speaking  \\n\\nfirst of all   i said   consider the nature of the qualification   just\\nthink what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their\\nproperty   and a poor man were refused permission to steer   even though\\nhe were a better pilot  \\n\\nyou mean that they would shipwreck  \\n\\nyes   and is not this true of the government of anything  \\n\\ni should imagine so  \\n\\nexcept a city  —or would you include a city  \\n\\nnay   he said   the case of a city is the strongest of all   inasmuch as\\nthe rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all  \\n\\nthis   then   will be the first great defect of oligarchy  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nand here is another defect which is quite as bad  \\n\\nwhat defect  \\n\\nthe inevitable division   such a state is not one   but two states   the\\none of poor   the other of rich men   and they are living on the same\\nspot and always conspiring against one another  \\n\\nthat   surely   is at least as bad  \\n\\nanother discreditable feature is   that   for a like reason   they are\\nincapable of carrying on any war   either they arm the multitude   and\\nthen they are more afraid of them than of the enemy   or   if they do not\\ncall them out in the hour of battle   they are oligarchs indeed   few to\\nfight as they are few to rule   and at the same time their fondness for\\nmoney makes them unwilling to pay taxes  \\n\\nhow discreditable  \\n\\nand   as we said before   under such a constitution the same persons have\\ntoo many callings—they are husbandmen   tradesmen   warriors   all in one  \\ndoes that look well  \\n\\nanything but well  \\n\\nthere is another evil which is   perhaps   the greatest of all   and to\\nwhich this state first begins to be liable  \\n\\nwhat evil  \\n\\na man may sell all that he has   and another may acquire his property  \\nyet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a\\npart   being neither trader   nor artisan   nor horseman   nor hoplite   but\\nonly a poor   helpless creature  \\n\\nyes   that is an evil which also first begins in this state  \\n\\nthe evil is certainly not prevented there   for oligarchies have both\\nthe extremes of great wealth and utter poverty  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nbut think again   in his wealthy days   while he was spending his money  \\nwas a man of this sort a whit more good to the state for the purposes\\nof citizenship   or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body  \\nalthough in truth he was neither ruler nor subject   but just a\\nspendthrift  \\n\\nas you say   he seemed to be a ruler   but was only a spendthrift  \\n\\nmay we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the\\ndrone in the honeycomb   and that the one is the plague of the city as\\nthe other is of the hive  \\n\\njust so   socrates  \\n\\nand god has made the flying drones   adeimantus   all without stings  \\nwhereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but\\nothers have dreadful stings   of the stingless class are those who in\\ntheir old age end as paupers   of the stingers come all the criminal\\nclass   as they are termed  \\n\\nmost true   he said  \\n\\nclearly then   whenever you see paupers in a state   somewhere in that\\nneighborhood there are hidden away thieves   and cut  purses and robbers\\nof temples   and all sorts of malefactors  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nwell   i said   and in oligarchical states do you not find paupers  \\n\\nyes   he said   nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler  \\n\\nand may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals\\nto be found in them   rogues who have stings   and whom the authorities\\nare careful to restrain by force  \\n\\ncertainly   we may be so bold  \\n\\nthe existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education  \\nill  training   and an evil constitution of the state  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nsuch   then   is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy   and there\\nmay be many other evils  \\n\\nvery likely  \\n\\nthen oligarchy   or the form of government in which the rulers are\\nelected for their wealth   may now be dismissed   let us next proceed to\\nconsider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this\\nstate  \\n\\nby all means  \\n\\ndoes not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this\\nwise  \\n\\nhow  \\n\\na time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son   at first\\nhe begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps   but\\npresently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the state as upon\\na sunken reef   and he and all that he has is lost   he may have been a\\ngeneral or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a\\nprejudice raised by informers   and either put to death   or exiled   or\\ndeprived of the privileges of a citizen   and all his property taken\\nfrom him  \\n\\nnothing more likely  \\n\\nand the son has seen and known all this—he is a ruined man   and his\\nfear has taught him to knock ambition and passion headforemost from his\\nbosom  s throne   humbled by poverty he takes to money  making and by mean\\nand miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together   is not such\\nan one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the\\nvacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him   girt\\nwith tiara and chain and scimitar  \\n\\nmost true   he replied  \\n\\nand when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground\\nobediently on either side of their sovereign   and taught them to know\\ntheir place   he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be\\nturned into larger ones   and will not allow the other to worship and\\nadmire anything but riches and rich men   or to be ambitious of anything\\nso much as the acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it  \\n\\nof all changes   he said   there is none so speedy or so sure as the\\nconversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one  \\n\\nand the avaricious   i said   is the oligarchical youth  \\n\\nyes   he said   at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like\\nthe state out of which oligarchy came  \\n\\nlet us then consider whether there is any likeness between them  \\n\\nvery good  \\n\\nfirst   then   they resemble one another in the value which they set upon\\nwealth  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nalso in their penurious   laborious character   the individual only\\nsatisfies his necessary appetites   and confines his expenditure to\\nthem   his other desires he subdues   under the idea that they are\\nunprofitable  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nhe is a shabby fellow   who saves something out of everything and makes\\na purse for himself   and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar\\napplaud   is he not a true image of the state which he represents  \\n\\nhe appears to me to be so   at any rate money is highly valued by him as\\nwell as by the state  \\n\\nyou see that he is not a man of cultivation   i said  \\n\\ni imagine not   he said   had he been educated he would never have made a\\nblind god director of his chorus   or given him chief honour  \\n\\nexcellent   i said   yet consider   must we not further admit that owing\\nto this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike\\ndesires as of pauper and rogue   which are forcibly kept down by his\\ngeneral habit of life  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\ndo you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his\\nrogueries  \\n\\nwhere must i look  \\n\\nyou should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting\\ndishonestly   as in the guardianship of an orphan  \\n\\naye  \\n\\nit will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give\\nhim a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced\\nvirtue   not making them see that they are wrong   or taming them by\\nreason   but by necessity and fear constraining them   and because he\\ntrembles for his possessions  \\n\\nto be sure  \\n\\nyes   indeed   my dear friend   but you will find that the natural desires\\nof the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to\\nspend what is not his own  \\n\\nyes   and they will be strong in him too  \\n\\nthe man   then   will be at war with himself   he will be two men   and not\\none   but   in general   his better desires will be found to prevail over\\nhis inferior ones  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nfor these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most\\npeople   yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will\\nflee far away and never come near him  \\n\\ni should expect so  \\n\\nand surely   the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in a\\nstate for any prize of victory   or other object of honourable ambition  \\nhe will not spend his money in the contest for glory   so afraid is he\\nof awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join\\nin the struggle   in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small\\npart only of his resources   and the result commonly is that he loses\\nthe prize and saves his money  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\ncan we any longer doubt   then   that the miser and money  maker answers\\nto the oligarchical state  \\n\\nthere can be no doubt  \\n\\nnext comes democracy   of this the origin and nature have still to be\\nconsidered by us   and then we will enquire into the ways of the\\ndemocratic man   and bring him up for judgment  \\n\\nthat   he said   is our method  \\n\\nwell   i said   and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy\\narise   is it not on this wise  —the good at which such a state aims is\\nto become as rich as possible   a desire which is insatiable  \\n\\nwhat then  \\n\\nthe rulers   being aware that their power rests upon their wealth  \\nrefuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth\\nbecause they gain by their ruin   they take interest from them and buy\\nup their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance  \\n\\nto be sure  \\n\\nthere can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of\\nmoderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any\\nconsiderable extent   one or the other will be disregarded  \\n\\nthat is tolerably clear  \\n\\nand in oligarchical states   from the general spread of carelessness and\\nextravagance   men of good family have often been reduced to beggary  \\n\\nyes   often  \\n\\nand still they remain in the city   there they are   ready to sting and\\nfully armed   and some of them owe money   some have forfeited their\\ncitizenship   a third class are in both predicaments   and they hate and\\nconspire against those who have got their property   and against\\neverybody else   and are eager for revolution  \\n\\nthat is true  \\n\\non the other hand   the men of business   stooping as they walk   and\\npretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined   insert\\ntheir sting—that is   their money—into some one else who is not on his\\nguard against them   and recover the parent sum many times over\\nmultiplied into a family of children   and so they make drone and pauper\\nto abound in the state  \\n\\nyes   he said   there are plenty of them—that is certain  \\n\\nthe evil blazes up like a fire   and they will not extinguish it   either\\nby restricting a man  s use of his own property   or by another remedy  \\n\\nwhat other  \\n\\none which is the next best   and has the advantage of compelling the\\ncitizens to look to their characters  —let there be a general rule that\\nevery one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk   and\\nthere will be less of this scandalous money  making   and the evils of\\nwhich we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the state  \\n\\nyes   they will be greatly lessened  \\n\\nat present the governors   induced by the motives which i have named  \\ntreat their subjects badly   while they and their adherents   especially\\nthe young men of the governing class   are habituated to lead a life of\\nluxury and idleness both of body and mind   they do nothing   and are\\nincapable of resisting either pleasure or pain  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nthey themselves care only for making money   and are as indifferent as\\nthe pauper to the cultivation of virtue  \\n\\nyes   quite as indifferent  \\n\\nsuch is the state of affairs which prevails among them   and often\\nrulers and their subjects may come in one another  s way   whether on a\\njourney or on some other occasion of meeting   on a pilgrimage or a\\nmarch   as fellow  soldiers or fellow  sailors   aye and they may observe\\nthe behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger—for where\\ndanger is   there is no fear that the poor will be despised by the\\nrich—and very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle\\nat the side of a wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and\\nhas plenty of superfluous flesh—when he sees such an one puffing and at\\nhis wits    end   how can he avoid drawing the conclusion that men like\\nhim are only rich because no one has the courage to despoil them   and\\nwhen they meet in private will not people be saying to one another   our\\nwarriors are not good for much    \\n\\nyes   he said   i am quite aware that this is their way of talking  \\n\\nand   as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from\\nwithout may bring on illness   and sometimes even when there is no\\nexternal provocation a commotion may arise within—in the same way\\nwherever there is weakness in the state there is also likely to be\\nillness   of which the occasion may be very slight   the one party\\nintroducing from without their oligarchical   the other their\\ndemocratical allies   and then the state falls sick   and is at war with\\nherself   and may be at times distracted   even when there is no external\\ncause  \\n\\nyes   surely  \\n\\nand then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their\\nopponents   slaughtering some and banishing some   while to the remainder\\nthey give an equal share of freedom and power   and this is the form of\\ngovernment in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot  \\n\\nyes   he said   that is the nature of democracy   whether the revolution\\nhas been effected by arms   or whether fear has caused the opposite\\nparty to withdraw  \\n\\nand now what is their manner of life   and what sort of a government\\nhave they   for as the government is   such will be the man  \\n\\nclearly   he said  \\n\\nin the first place   are they not free   and is not the city full of\\nfreedom and frankness—a man may say and do what he likes  \\n\\n  tis said so   he replied  \\n\\nand where freedom is   the individual is clearly able to order for\\nhimself his own life as he pleases  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nthen in this kind of state there will be the greatest variety of human\\nnatures  \\n\\nthere will  \\n\\nthis   then   seems likely to be the fairest of states   being like an\\nembroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower   and just\\nas women and children think a variety of colours to be of all things\\nmost charming   so there are many men to whom this state   which is\\nspangled with the manners and characters of mankind   will appear to be\\nthe fairest of states  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nyes   my good sir   and there will be no better in which to look for a\\ngovernment  \\n\\nwhy  \\n\\nbecause of the liberty which reigns there—they have a complete\\nassortment of constitutions   and he who has a mind to establish a\\nstate   as we have been doing   must go to a democracy as he would to a\\nbazaar at which they sell them   and pick out the one that suits him  \\nthen   when he has made his choice   he may found his state  \\n\\nhe will be sure to have patterns enough  \\n\\nand there being no necessity   i said   for you to govern in this state  \\neven if you have the capacity   or to be governed   unless you like   or\\ngo to war when the rest go to war   or to be at peace when others are at\\npeace   unless you are so disposed—there being no necessity also  \\nbecause some law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast   that you\\nshould not hold office or be a dicast   if you have a fancy—is not this\\na way of life which for the moment is supremely delightful  \\n\\nfor the moment   yes  \\n\\nand is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite\\ncharming   have you not observed how   in a democracy   many persons  \\nalthough they have been sentenced to death or exile   just stay where\\nthey are and walk about the world—the gentleman parades like a hero  \\nand nobody sees or cares  \\n\\nyes   he replied   many and many a one  \\n\\nsee too   i said   the forgiving spirit of democracy   and the   don  t\\ncare   about trifles   and the disregard which she shows of all the fine\\nprinciples which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the city—as\\nwhen we said that   except in the case of some rarely gifted nature  \\nthere never will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used\\nto play amid things of beauty and make of them a joy and a study—how\\ngrandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet  \\nnever giving a thought to the pursuits which make a statesman   and\\npromoting to honour any one who professes to be the people  s friend  \\n\\nyes   she is of a noble spirit  \\n\\nthese and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy   which\\nis a charming form of government   full of variety and disorder   and\\ndispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike  \\n\\nwe know her well  \\n\\nconsider now   i said   what manner of man the individual is   or rather\\nconsider   as in the case of the state   how he comes into being  \\n\\nvery good   he said  \\n\\nis not this the way—he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical\\nfather who has trained him in his own habits  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nand   like his father   he keeps under by force the pleasures which are\\nof the spending and not of the getting sort   being those which are\\ncalled unnecessary  \\n\\nobviously  \\n\\nwould you like   for the sake of clearness   to distinguish which are the\\nnecessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures  \\n\\ni should  \\n\\nare not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid   and of\\nwhich the satisfaction is a benefit to us   and they are rightly called\\nso   because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial\\nand what is necessary   and cannot help it  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nwe are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary  \\n\\nwe are not  \\n\\nand the desires of which a man may get rid   if he takes pains from his\\nyouth upwards—of which the presence   moreover   does no good   and in\\nsome cases the reverse of good—shall we not be right in saying that all\\nthese are unnecessary  \\n\\nyes   certainly  \\n\\nsuppose we select an example of either kind   in order that we may have\\na general notion of them  \\n\\nvery good  \\n\\nwill not the desire of eating   that is   of simple food and condiments  \\nin so far as they are required for health and strength   be of the\\nnecessary class  \\n\\nthat is what i should suppose  \\n\\nthe pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways   it does us good and it\\nis essential to the continuance of life  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nbut the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for\\nhealth  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand the desire which goes beyond this   of more delicate food   or other\\nluxuries   which might generally be got rid of   if controlled and\\ntrained in youth   and is hurtful to the body   and hurtful to the soul\\nin the pursuit of wisdom and virtue   may be rightly called unnecessary  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nmay we not say that these desires spend   and that the others make money\\nbecause they conduce to production  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand of the pleasures of love   and all other pleasures   the same holds\\ngood  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures\\nand desires of this sort   and was the slave of the unnecessary desires  \\nwhereas he who was subject to the necessary only was miserly and\\noligarchical  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nagain   let us see how the democratical man grows out of the\\noligarchical   the following   as i suspect   is commonly the process  \\n\\nwhat is the process  \\n\\nwhen a young man who has been brought up as we were just now\\ndescribing   in a vulgar and miserly way   has tasted drones   honey and\\nhas come to associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to\\nprovide for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of\\npleasure—then   as you may imagine   the change will begin of the\\noligarchical principle within him into the democratical  \\n\\ninevitably  \\n\\nand as in the city like was helping like   and the change was effected\\nby an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens   so\\ntoo the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without\\nto assist the desires within him   that which is akin and alike again\\nhelping that which is akin and alike  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within\\nhim   whether the influence of a father or of kindred   advising or\\nrebuking him   then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite\\nfaction   and he goes to war with himself  \\n\\nit must be so  \\n\\nand there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the\\noligarchical   and some of his desires die   and others are banished   a\\nspirit of reverence enters into the young man  s soul and order is\\nrestored  \\n\\nyes   he said   that sometimes happens  \\n\\nand then   again   after the old desires have been driven out   fresh ones\\nspring up   which are akin to them   and because he their father does not\\nknow how to educate them   wax fierce and numerous  \\n\\nyes   he said   that is apt to be the way  \\n\\nthey draw him to his old associates   and holding secret intercourse\\nwith them   breed and multiply in him  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nat length they seize upon the citadel of the young man  s soul   which\\nthey perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and\\ntrue words   which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to\\nthe gods   and are their best guardians and sentinels  \\n\\nnone better  \\n\\nfalse and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their\\nplace  \\n\\nthey are certain to do so  \\n\\nand so the young man returns into the country of the lotus  eaters   and\\ntakes up his dwelling there in the face of all men   and if any help be\\nsent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him   the aforesaid vain\\nconceits shut the gate of the king  s fastness   and they will neither\\nallow the embassy itself to enter   nor if private advisers offer the\\nfatherly counsel of the aged will they listen to them or receive them  \\nthere is a battle and they gain the day   and then modesty   which they\\ncall silliness   is ignominiously thrust into exile by them   and\\ntemperance   which they nickname unmanliness   is trampled in the mire\\nand cast forth   they persuade men that moderation and orderly\\nexpenditure are vulgarity and meanness   and so   by the help of a rabble\\nof evil appetites   they drive them beyond the border  \\n\\nyes   with a will  \\n\\nand when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is now\\nin their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries  \\nthe next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy\\nand waste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads  \\nand a great company with them   hymning their praises and calling them\\nby sweet names   insolence they term breeding   and anarchy liberty   and\\nwaste magnificence   and impudence courage   and so the young man passes\\nout of his original nature   which was trained in the school of\\nnecessity   into the freedom and libertinism of useless and unnecessary\\npleasures  \\n\\nyes   he said   the change in him is visible enough  \\n\\nafter this he lives on   spending his money and labour and time on\\nunnecessary pleasures quite as much as on necessary ones   but if he be\\nfortunate   and is not too much disordered in his wits   when years have\\nelapsed   and the heyday of passion is over—supposing that he then\\nre  admits into the city some part of the exiled virtues   and does not\\nwholly give himself up to their successors—in that case he balances his\\npleasures and lives in a sort of equilibrium   putting the government of\\nhimself into the hands of the one which comes first and wins the turn  \\nand when he has had enough of that   then into the hands of another   he\\ndespises none of them but encourages them all equally  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nneither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of\\nadvice   if any one says to him that some pleasures are the\\nsatisfactions of good and noble desires   and others of evil desires  \\nand that he ought to use and honour some and chastise and master the\\nothers—whenever this is repeated to him he shakes his head and says\\nthat they are all alike   and that one is as good as another  \\n\\nyes   he said   that is the way with him  \\n\\nyes   i said   he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the\\nhour   and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute  \\nthen he becomes a water  drinker   and tries to get thin   then he takes a\\nturn at gymnastics   sometimes idling and neglecting everything   then\\nonce more living the life of a philosopher   often he is busy with\\npolitics   and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into\\nhis head   and   if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior   off he is\\nin that direction   or of men of business   once more in that   his life\\nhas neither law nor order   and this distracted existence he terms joy\\nand bliss and freedom   and so he goes on  \\n\\nyes   he replied   he is all liberty and equality  \\n\\nyes   i said   his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the\\nlives of many  —he answers to the state which we described as fair and\\nspangled   and many a man and many a woman will take him for their\\npattern   and many a constitution and many an example of manners is\\ncontained in him  \\n\\njust so  \\n\\nlet him then be set over against democracy   he may truly be called the\\ndemocratic man  \\n\\nlet that be his place   he said  \\n\\nlast of all comes the most beautiful of all   man and state alike  \\ntyranny and the tyrant   these we have now to consider  \\n\\nquite true   he said  \\n\\nsay then   my friend   in what manner does tyranny arise  —that it has a\\ndemocratic origin is evident  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nand does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as\\ndemocracy from oligarchy—i mean   after a sort  \\n\\nhow  \\n\\nthe good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it\\nwas maintained was excess of wealth—am i not right  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things\\nfor the sake of money  getting was also the ruin of oligarchy  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand democracy has her own good   of which the insatiable desire brings\\nher to dissolution  \\n\\nwhat good  \\n\\nfreedom   i replied   which   as they tell you in a democracy   is the\\nglory of the state—and that therefore in a democracy alone will the\\nfreeman of nature deign to dwell  \\n\\nyes   the saying is in every body  s mouth  \\n\\ni was going to observe   that the insatiable desire of this and the\\nneglect of other things introduces the change in democracy   which\\noccasions a demand for tyranny  \\n\\nhow so  \\n\\nwhen a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cup  bearers\\npresiding over the feast   and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine\\nof freedom   then   unless her rulers are very amenable and give a\\nplentiful draught   she calls them to account and punishes them   and\\nsays that they are cursed oligarchs  \\n\\nyes   he replied   a very common occurrence  \\n\\nyes   i said   and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves\\nwho hug their chains and men of naught   she would have subjects who are\\nlike rulers   and rulers who are like subjects   these are men after her\\nown heart   whom she praises and honours both in private and public  \\nnow   in such a state   can liberty have any limit  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nby degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses   and ends by\\ngetting among the animals and infecting them  \\n\\nhow do you mean  \\n\\ni mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his\\nsons and to fear them   and the son is on a level with his father   he\\nhaving no respect or reverence for either of his parents   and this is\\nhis freedom   and the metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen\\nwith the metic   and the stranger is quite as good as either  \\n\\nyes   he said   that is the way  \\n\\nand these are not the only evils   i said—there are several lesser ones  \\nin such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars  \\nand the scholars despise their masters and tutors   young and old are\\nall alike   and the young man is on a level with the old   and is ready\\nto compete with him in word or deed   and old men condescend to the\\nyoung and are full of pleasantry and gaiety   they are loth to be\\nthought morose and authoritative   and therefore they adopt the manners\\nof the young  \\n\\nquite true   he said  \\n\\nthe last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with\\nmoney   whether male or female   is just as free as his or her purchaser  \\nnor must i forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes\\nin relation to each other  \\n\\nwhy not   as aeschylus says   utter the word which rises to our lips  \\n\\nthat is what i am doing   i replied   and i must add that no one who does\\nnot know would believe   how much greater is the liberty which the\\nanimals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in\\nany other state   for truly   the she  dogs   as the proverb says   are as\\ngood as their she  mistresses   and the horses and asses have a way of\\nmarching along with all the rights and dignities of freemen   and they\\nwill run at any body who comes in their way if he does not leave the\\nroad clear for them   and all things are just ready to burst with\\nliberty  \\n\\nwhen i take a country walk   he said   i often experience what you\\ndescribe   you and i have dreamed the same thing  \\n\\nand above all   i said   and as the result of all   see how sensitive the\\ncitizens become   they chafe impatiently at the least touch of\\nauthority   and at length   as you know   they cease to care even for the\\nlaws   written or unwritten   they will have no one over them  \\n\\nyes   he said   i know it too well  \\n\\nsuch   my friend   i said   is the fair and glorious beginning out of\\nwhich springs tyranny  \\n\\nglorious indeed   he said   but what is the next step  \\n\\nthe ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy   the same disease\\nmagnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy—the truth\\nbeing that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction\\nin the opposite direction   and this is the case not only in the seasons\\nand in vegetable and animal life   but above all in forms of government  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthe excess of liberty   whether in states or individuals   seems only to\\npass into excess of slavery  \\n\\nyes   the natural order  \\n\\nand so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy   and the most\\naggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of\\nliberty  \\n\\nas we might expect  \\n\\nthat   however   was not   as i believe   your question—you rather desired\\nto know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and\\ndemocracy   and is the ruin of both  \\n\\njust so   he replied  \\n\\nwell   i said   i meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts   of\\nwhom the more courageous are the leaders and the more timid the\\nfollowers   the same whom we were comparing to drones   some stingless  \\nand others having stings  \\n\\na very just comparison  \\n\\nthese two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are\\ngenerated   being what phlegm and bile are to the body   and the good\\nphysician and lawgiver of the state ought   like the wise bee  master   to\\nkeep them at a distance and prevent   if possible   their ever coming in  \\nand if they have anyhow found a way in   then he should have them and\\ntheir cells cut out as speedily as possible  \\n\\nyes   by all means   he said  \\n\\nthen   in order that we may see clearly what we are doing   let us\\nimagine democracy to be divided   as indeed it is   into three classes  \\nfor in the first place freedom creates rather more drones in the\\ndemocratic than there were in the oligarchical state  \\n\\nthat is true  \\n\\nand in the democracy they are certainly more intensified  \\n\\nhow so  \\n\\nbecause in the oligarchical state they are disqualified and driven from\\noffice   and therefore they cannot train or gather strength   whereas in\\na democracy they are almost the entire ruling power   and while the\\nkeener sort speak and act   the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do\\nnot suffer a word to be said on the other side   hence in democracies\\nalmost everything is managed by the drones  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nthen there is another class which is always being severed from the\\nmass  \\n\\nwhat is that  \\n\\nthey are the orderly class   which in a nation of traders is sure to be\\nthe richest  \\n\\nnaturally so  \\n\\nthey are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of\\nhoney to the drones  \\n\\nwhy   he said   there is little to be squeezed out of people who have\\nlittle  \\n\\nand this is called the wealthy class   and the drones feed upon them  \\n\\nthat is pretty much the case   he said  \\n\\nthe people are a third class   consisting of those who work with their\\nown hands   they are not politicians   and have not much to live upon  \\nthis   when assembled   is the largest and most powerful class in a\\ndemocracy  \\n\\ntrue   he said   but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate\\nunless they get a little honey  \\n\\nand do they not share   i said   do not their leaders deprive the rich of\\ntheir estates and distribute them among the people   at the same time\\ntaking care to reserve the larger part for themselves  \\n\\nwhy   yes   he said   to that extent the people do share  \\n\\nand the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to\\ndefend themselves before the people as they best can  \\n\\nwhat else can they do  \\n\\nand then   although they may have no desire of change   the others charge\\nthem with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand the end is that when they see the people   not of their own accord  \\nbut through ignorance   and because they are deceived by informers  \\nseeking to do them wrong   then at last they are forced to become\\noligarchs in reality   they do not wish to be   but the sting of the\\ndrones torments them and breeds revolution in them  \\n\\nthat is exactly the truth  \\n\\nthen come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthe people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse\\ninto greatness  \\n\\nyes   that is their way  \\n\\nthis and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs   when he\\nfirst appears above ground he is a protector  \\n\\nyes   that is quite clear  \\n\\nhow then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant   clearly when\\nhe does what the man is said to do in the tale of the arcadian temple\\nof lycaean zeus  \\n\\nwhat tale  \\n\\nthe tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human\\nvictim minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to\\nbecome a wolf   did you never hear it  \\n\\noh   yes  \\n\\nand the protector of the people is like him   having a mob entirely at\\nhis disposal   he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen  \\nby the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court\\nand murders them   making the life of man to disappear   and with unholy\\ntongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizens   some he kills\\nand others he banishes   at the same time hinting at the abolition of\\ndebts and partition of lands   and after this   what will be his destiny  \\nmust he not either perish at the hands of his enemies   or from being a\\nman become a wolf—that is   a tyrant  \\n\\ninevitably  \\n\\nthis   i said   is he who begins to make a party against the rich  \\n\\nthe same  \\n\\nafter a while he is driven out   but comes back   in spite of his\\nenemies   a tyrant full grown  \\n\\nthat is clear  \\n\\nand if they are unable to expel him   or to get him condemned to death\\nby a public accusation   they conspire to assassinate him  \\n\\nyes   he said   that is their usual way  \\n\\nthen comes the famous request for a body  guard   which is the device of\\nall those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career—  let not the\\npeople  s friend     as they say     be lost to them    \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nthe people readily assent   all their fears are for him—they have none\\nfor themselves  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy of\\nthe people sees this   then   my friend   as the oracle said to croesus  \\n\\n  by pebbly hermus   shore he flees and rests not   and is not ashamed to\\nbe a coward    \\n\\nand quite right too   said he   for if he were   he would never be ashamed\\nagain  \\n\\nbut if he is caught he dies  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nand he   the protector of whom we spoke   is to be seen   not   larding the\\nplain   with his bulk   but himself the overthrower of many   standing up\\nin the chariot of state with the reins in his hand   no longer\\nprotector   but tyrant absolute  \\n\\nno doubt   he said  \\n\\nand now let us consider the happiness of the man   and also of the state\\nin which a creature like him is generated  \\n\\nyes   he said   let us consider that  \\n\\nat first   in the early days of his power   he is full of smiles   and he\\nsalutes every one whom he meets  —he to be called a tyrant   who is\\nmaking promises in public and also in private   liberating debtors   and\\ndistributing land to the people and his followers   and wanting to be so\\nkind and good to every one  \\n\\nof course   he said  \\n\\nbut when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty   and\\nthere is nothing to fear from them   then he is always stirring up some\\nwar or other   in order that the people may require a leader  \\n\\nto be sure  \\n\\nhas he not also another object   which is that they may be impoverished\\nby payment of taxes   and thus compelled to devote themselves to their\\ndaily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nand if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom  \\nand of resistance to his authority   he will have a good pretext for\\ndestroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy   and for all\\nthese reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war  \\n\\nhe must  \\n\\nnow he begins to grow unpopular  \\n\\na necessary result  \\n\\nthen some of those who joined in setting him up   and who are in power  \\nspeak their minds to him and to one another   and the more courageous of\\nthem cast in his teeth what is being done  \\n\\nyes   that may be expected  \\n\\nand the tyrant   if he means to rule   must get rid of them   he cannot\\nstop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything  \\n\\nhe cannot  \\n\\nand therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant   who is\\nhigh  minded   who is wise   who is wealthy   happy man   he is the enemy of\\nthem all   and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no  \\nuntil he has made a purgation of the state  \\n\\nyes   he said   and a rare purgation  \\n\\nyes   i said   not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of the\\nbody   for they take away the worse and leave the better part   but he\\ndoes the reverse  \\n\\nif he is to rule   i suppose that he cannot help himself  \\n\\nwhat a blessed alternative   i said  —to be compelled to dwell only with\\nthe many bad   and to be by them hated   or not to live at all  \\n\\nyes   that is the alternative  \\n\\nand the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more\\nsatellites and the greater devotion in them will he require  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand who are the devoted band   and where will he procure them  \\n\\nthey will flock to him   he said   of their own accord   if he pays them  \\n\\nby the dog   i said   here are more drones   of every sort and from every\\nland  \\n\\nyes   he said   there are  \\n\\nbut will he not desire to get them on the spot  \\n\\nhow do you mean  \\n\\nhe will rob the citizens of their slaves   he will then set them free\\nand enrol them in his body  guard  \\n\\nto be sure   he said   and he will be able to trust them best of all  \\n\\nwhat a blessed creature   i said   must this tyrant be   he has put to\\ndeath the others and has these for his trusted friends  \\n\\nyes   he said   they are quite of his sort  \\n\\nyes   i said   and these are the new citizens whom he has called into\\nexistence   who admire him and are his companions   while the good hate\\nand avoid him  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nverily   then   tragedy is a wise thing and euripides a great tragedian  \\n\\nwhy so  \\n\\nwhy   because he is the author of the pregnant saying  \\n\\n  tyrants are wise by living with the wise    \\n\\nand he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant\\nmakes his companions  \\n\\nyes   he said   and he also praises tyranny as godlike   and many other\\nthings of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets  \\n\\nand therefore   i said   the tragic poets being wise men will forgive us\\nand any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into\\nour state   because they are the eulogists of tyranny  \\n\\nyes   he said   those who have the wit will doubtless forgive us  \\n\\nbut they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs   and hire\\nvoices fair and loud and persuasive   and draw the cities over to\\ntyrannies and democracies  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nmoreover   they are paid for this and receive honour—the greatest\\nhonour   as might be expected   from tyrants   and the next greatest from\\ndemocracies   but the higher they ascend our constitution hill   the more\\ntheir reputation fails   and seems unable from shortness of breath to\\nproceed further  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nbut we are wandering from the subject   let us therefore return and\\nenquire how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various\\nand ever  changing army of his  \\n\\nif   he said   there are sacred treasures in the city   he will confiscate\\nand spend them   and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons may\\nsuffice   he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise\\nhave to impose upon the people  \\n\\nand when these fail  \\n\\nwhy   clearly   he said   then he and his boon companions   whether male or\\nfemale   will be maintained out of his father  s estate  \\n\\nyou mean to say that the people   from whom he has derived his being  \\nwill maintain him and his companions  \\n\\nyes   he said   they cannot help themselves  \\n\\nbut what if the people fly into a passion   and aver that a grown  up son\\nought not to be supported by his father   but that the father should be\\nsupported by the son   the father did not bring him into being   or\\nsettle him in life   in order that when his son became a man he should\\nhimself be the servant of his own servants and should support him and\\nhis rabble of slaves and companions   but that his son should protect\\nhim   and that by his help he might be emancipated from the government\\nof the rich and aristocratic   as they are termed   and so he bids him\\nand his companions depart   just as any other father might drive out of\\nthe house a riotous son and his undesirable associates  \\n\\nby heaven   he said   then the parent will discover what a monster he has\\nbeen fostering in his bosom   and   when he wants to drive him out   he\\nwill find that he is weak and his son strong  \\n\\nwhy   you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence   what  \\nbeat his father if he opposes him  \\n\\nyes   he will   having first disarmed him  \\n\\nthen he is a parricide   and a cruel guardian of an aged parent   and\\nthis is real tyranny   about which there can be no longer a mistake   as\\nthe saying is   the people who would escape the smoke which is the\\nslavery of freemen   has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of\\nslaves   thus liberty   getting out of all order and reason   passes into\\nthe harshest and bitterest form of slavery  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nvery well   and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently\\ndiscussed the nature of tyranny   and the manner of the transition from\\ndemocracy to tyranny  \\n\\nyes   quite enough   he said  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book ix  \\n\\n\\nlast of all comes the tyrannical man   about whom we have once more to\\nask   how is he formed out of the democratical   and how does he live   in\\nhappiness or in misery  \\n\\nyes   he said   he is the only one remaining  \\n\\nthere is   however   i said   a previous question which remains\\nunanswered  \\n\\nwhat question  \\n\\ni do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number\\nof the appetites   and until this is accomplished the enquiry will\\nalways be confused  \\n\\nwell   he said   it is not too late to supply the omission  \\n\\nvery true   i said   and observe the point which i want to understand  \\ncertain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites i conceive to be\\nunlawful   every one appears to have them   but in some persons they are\\ncontrolled by the laws and by reason   and the better desires prevail\\nover them—either they are wholly banished or they become few and weak  \\nwhile in the case of others they are stronger   and there are more of\\nthem  \\n\\nwhich appetites do you mean  \\n\\ni mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling\\npower is asleep   then the wild beast within us   gorged with meat or\\ndrink   starts up and having shaken off sleep   goes forth to satisfy his\\ndesires   and there is no conceivable folly or crime—not excepting\\nincest or any other unnatural union   or parricide   or the eating of\\nforbidden food—which at such a time   when he has parted company with\\nall shame and sense   a man may not be ready to commit  \\n\\nmost true   he said  \\n\\nbut when a man  s pulse is healthy and temperate   and when before going\\nto sleep he has awakened his rational powers   and fed them on noble\\nthoughts and enquiries   collecting himself in meditation   after having\\nfirst indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little   but just\\nenough to lay them to sleep   and prevent them and their enjoyments and\\npains from interfering with the higher principle—which he leaves in the\\nsolitude of pure abstraction   free to contemplate and aspire to the\\nknowledge of the unknown   whether in past   present   or future   when\\nagain he has allayed the passionate element   if he has a quarrel\\nagainst any one—i say   when   after pacifying the two irrational\\nprinciples   he rouses up the third   which is reason   before he takes\\nhis rest   then   as you know   he attains truth most nearly   and is least\\nlikely to be the sport of fantastic and lawless visions  \\n\\ni quite agree  \\n\\nin saying this i have been running into a digression   but the point\\nwhich i desire to note is that in all of us   even in good men   there is\\na lawless wild  beast nature   which peers out in sleep   pray   consider\\nwhether i am right   and you agree with me  \\n\\nyes   i agree  \\n\\nand now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic\\nman   he was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under\\na miserly parent   who encouraged the saving appetites in him   but\\ndiscountenanced the unnecessary   which aim only at amusement and\\nornament  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand then he got into the company of a more refined   licentious sort of\\npeople   and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite\\nextreme from an abhorrence of his father  s meanness   at last   being a\\nbetter man than his corruptors   he was drawn in both directions until\\nhe halted midway and led a life   not of vulgar and slavish passion   but\\nof what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures   after this\\nmanner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch  \\n\\nyes   he said   that was our view of him   and is so still  \\n\\nand now   i said   years will have passed away   and you must conceive\\nthis man   such as he is   to have a son   who is brought up in his\\nfather  s principles  \\n\\ni can imagine him  \\n\\nthen you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which\\nhas already happened to the father  —he is drawn into a perfectly\\nlawless life   which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty   and his\\nfather and friends take part with his moderate desires   and the\\nopposite party assist the opposite ones   as soon as these dire\\nmagicians and tyrant  makers find that they are losing their hold on\\nhim   they contrive to implant in him a master passion   to be lord over\\nhis idle and spendthrift lusts—a sort of monstrous winged drone—that is\\nthe only image which will adequately describe him  \\n\\nyes   he said   that is the only adequate image of him  \\n\\nand when his other lusts   amid clouds of incense and perfumes and\\ngarlands and wines   and all the pleasures of a dissolute life   now let\\nloose   come buzzing around him   nourishing to the utmost the sting of\\ndesire which they implant in his drone  like nature   then at last this\\nlord of the soul   having madness for the captain of his guard   breaks\\nout into a frenzy   and if he finds in himself any good opinions or\\nappetites in process of formation   and there is in him any sense of\\nshame remaining   to these better principles he puts an end   and casts\\nthem forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness\\nto the full  \\n\\nyes   he said   that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated  \\n\\nand is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant  \\n\\ni should not wonder  \\n\\nfurther   i said   has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant  \\n\\nhe has  \\n\\nand you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind   will\\nfancy that he is able to rule   not only over men   but also over the\\ngods  \\n\\nthat he will  \\n\\nand the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being\\nwhen   either under the influence of nature   or habit   or both   he\\nbecomes drunken   lustful   passionate   o my friend   is not that so  \\n\\nassuredly  \\n\\nsuch is the man and such is his origin   and next   how does he live  \\n\\nsuppose   as people facetiously say   you were to tell me  \\n\\ni imagine   i said   at the next step in his progress   that there will be\\nfeasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans   and all that sort\\nof thing   love is the lord of the house within him   and orders all the\\nconcerns of his soul  \\n\\nthat is certain  \\n\\nyes   and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable  \\nand their demands are many  \\n\\nthey are indeed   he said  \\n\\nhis revenues   if he has any   are soon spent  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthen comes debt and the cutting down of his property  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nwhen he has nothing left   must not his desires   crowding in the nest\\nlike young ravens   be crying aloud for food   and he   goaded on by them  \\nand especially by love himself   who is in a manner the captain of them  \\nis in a frenzy   and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil\\nof his property   in order that he may gratify them  \\n\\nyes   that is sure to be the case  \\n\\nhe must have money   no matter how   if he is to escape horrid pains and\\npangs  \\n\\nhe must  \\n\\nand as in himself there was a succession of pleasures   and the new got\\nthe better of the old and took away their rights   so he being younger\\nwill claim to have more than his father and his mother   and if he has\\nspent his own share of the property   he will take a slice of theirs  \\n\\nno doubt he will  \\n\\nand if his parents will not give way   then he will try first of all to\\ncheat and deceive them  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand if he fails   then he will use force and plunder them  \\n\\nyes   probably  \\n\\nand if the old man and woman fight for their own   what then   my friend  \\nwill the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them  \\n\\nnay   he said   i should not feel at all comfortable about his parents  \\n\\nbut   o heavens   adeimantus   on account of some new  fangled love of a\\nharlot   who is anything but a necessary connection   can you believe\\nthat he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary\\nto his very existence   and would place her under the authority of the\\nother   when she is brought under the same roof with her   or that   under\\nlike circumstances   he would do the same to his withered old father  \\nfirst and most indispensable of friends   for the sake of some\\nnewly  found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable  \\n\\nyes   indeed   he said   i believe that he would  \\n\\ntruly   then   i said   a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and\\nmother  \\n\\nhe is indeed   he replied  \\n\\nhe first takes their property   and when that fails   and pleasures are\\nbeginning to swarm in the hive of his soul   then he breaks into a\\nhouse   or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer   next he\\nproceeds to clear a temple   meanwhile the old opinions which he had\\nwhen a child   and which gave judgment about good and evil   are\\noverthrown by those others which have just been emancipated   and are\\nnow the body  guard of love and share his empire   these in his\\ndemocratic days   when he was still subject to the laws and to his\\nfather   were only let loose in the dreams of sleep   but now that he is\\nunder the dominion of love   he becomes always and in waking reality\\nwhat he was then very rarely and in a dream only   he will commit the\\nfoulest murder   or eat forbidden food   or be guilty of any other horrid\\nact   love is his tyrant   and lives lordly in him and lawlessly   and\\nbeing himself a king   leads him on   as a tyrant leads a state   to the\\nperformance of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and\\nthe rabble of his associates   whether those whom evil communications\\nhave brought in from without   or those whom he himself has allowed to\\nbreak loose within him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself  \\nhave we not here a picture of his way of life  \\n\\nyes   indeed   he said  \\n\\nand if there are only a few of them in the state   and the rest of the\\npeople are well disposed   they go away and become the body  guard or\\nmercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them for\\na war   and if there is no war   they stay at home and do many little\\npieces of mischief in the city  \\n\\nwhat sort of mischief  \\n\\nfor example   they are the thieves   burglars   cut  purses   foot  pads  \\nrobbers of temples   man  stealers of the community   or if they are able\\nto speak they turn informers   and bear false witness   and take bribes  \\n\\na small catalogue of evils   even if the perpetrators of them are few in\\nnumber  \\n\\nyes   i said   but small and great are comparative terms   and all these\\nthings   in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a state   do not\\ncome within a thousand miles of the tyrant   when this noxious class and\\ntheir followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength  \\nassisted by the infatuation of the people   they choose from among\\nthemselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul   and him\\nthey create their tyrant  \\n\\nyes   he said   and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant  \\n\\nif the people yield   well and good   but if they resist him   as he began\\nby beating his own father and mother   so now   if he has the power   he\\nbeats them   and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland   as the\\ncretans say   in subjection to his young retainers whom he has\\nintroduced to be their rulers and masters   this is the end of his\\npassions and desires  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nwhen such men are only private individuals and before they get power  \\nthis is their character   they associate entirely with their own\\nflatterers or ready tools   or if they want anything from anybody   they\\nin their turn are equally ready to bow down before them   they profess\\nevery sort of affection for them   but when they have gained their point\\nthey know them no more  \\n\\nyes   truly  \\n\\nthey are always either the masters or servants and never the friends of\\nanybody   the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nand may we not rightly call such men treacherous  \\n\\nno question  \\n\\nalso they are utterly unjust   if we were right in our notion of\\njustice  \\n\\nyes   he said   and we were perfectly right  \\n\\nlet us then sum up in a word   i said   the character of the worst man  \\nhe is the waking reality of what we dreamed  \\n\\nmost true  \\n\\nand this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule   and the\\nlonger he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes  \\n\\nthat is certain   said glaucon   taking his turn to answer  \\n\\nand will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest   be also the\\nmost miserable   and he who has tyrannized longest and most   most\\ncontinually and truly miserable   although this may not be the opinion\\nof men in general  \\n\\nyes   he said   inevitably  \\n\\nand must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical state   and the\\ndemocratical man like the democratical state   and the same of the\\nothers  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand as state is to state in virtue and happiness   so is man in relation\\nto man  \\n\\nto be sure  \\n\\nthen comparing our original city   which was under a king   and the city\\nwhich is under a tyrant   how do they stand as to virtue  \\n\\nthey are the opposite extremes   he said   for one is the very best and\\nthe other is the very worst  \\n\\nthere can be no mistake   i said   as to which is which   and therefore i\\nwill at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision\\nabout their relative happiness and misery   and here we must not allow\\nourselves to be panic  stricken at the apparition of the tyrant   who is\\nonly a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him   but let us\\ngo as we ought into every corner of the city and look all about   and\\nthen we will give our opinion  \\n\\na fair invitation   he replied   and i see   as every one must   that a\\ntyranny is the wretchedest form of government   and the rule of a king\\nthe happiest  \\n\\nand in estimating the men too   may i not fairly make a like request  \\nthat i should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through\\nhuman nature   he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and\\nis dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to\\nthe beholder   but let him be one who has a clear insight   may i suppose\\nthat the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able\\nto judge   and has dwelt in the same place with him   and been present at\\nhis dally life and known him in his family relations   where he may be\\nseen stripped of his tragedy attire   and again in the hour of public\\ndanger—he shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant\\nwhen compared with other men  \\n\\nthat again   he said   is a very fair proposal  \\n\\nshall i assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and\\nhave before now met with such a person   we shall then have some one who\\nwill answer our enquiries  \\n\\nby all means  \\n\\nlet me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the\\nstate   bearing this in mind   and glancing in turn from one to the other\\nof them   will you tell me their respective conditions  \\n\\nwhat do you mean   he asked  \\n\\nbeginning with the state   i replied   would you say that a city which is\\ngoverned by a tyrant is free or enslaved  \\n\\nno city   he said   can be more completely enslaved  \\n\\nand yet   as you see   there are freemen as well as masters in such a\\nstate  \\n\\nyes   he said   i see that there are—a few   but the people   speaking\\ngenerally   and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved  \\n\\nthen if the man is like the state   i said   must not the same rule\\nprevail   his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity—the best elements\\nin him are enslaved   and there is a small ruling part   which is also\\nthe worst and maddest  \\n\\ninevitably  \\n\\nand would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a\\nfreeman   or of a slave  \\n\\nhe has the soul of a slave   in my opinion  \\n\\nand the state which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of\\nacting voluntarily  \\n\\nutterly incapable  \\n\\nand also the soul which is under a tyrant   i am speaking of the soul\\ntaken as a whole   is least capable of doing what she desires   there is\\na gadfly which goads her   and she is full of trouble and remorse  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor  \\n\\npoor  \\n\\nand the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand must not such a state and such a man be always full of fear  \\n\\nyes   indeed  \\n\\nis there any state in which you will find more of lamentation and\\nsorrow and groaning and pain  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nand is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery\\nthan in the tyrannical man   who is in a fury of passions and desires  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nreflecting upon these and similar evils   you held the tyrannical state\\nto be the most miserable of states  \\n\\nand i was right   he said  \\n\\ncertainly   i said   and when you see the same evils in the tyrannical\\nman   what do you say of him  \\n\\ni say that he is by far the most miserable of all men  \\n\\nthere   i said   i think that you are beginning to go wrong  \\n\\nwhat do you mean  \\n\\ni do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery  \\n\\nthen who is more miserable  \\n\\none of whom i am about to speak  \\n\\nwho is that  \\n\\nhe who is of a tyrannical nature   and instead of leading a private life\\nhas been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant  \\n\\nfrom what has been said   i gather that you are right  \\n\\nyes   i replied   but in this high argument you should be a little more\\ncertain   and should not conjecture only   for of all questions   this\\nrespecting good and evil is the greatest  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nlet me then offer you an illustration   which may   i think   throw a\\nlight upon this subject  \\n\\nwhat is your illustration  \\n\\nthe case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves   from\\nthem you may form an idea of the tyrant  s condition   for they both have\\nslaves   the only difference is that he has more slaves  \\n\\nyes   that is the difference  \\n\\nyou know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from\\ntheir servants  \\n\\nwhat should they fear  \\n\\nnothing   but do you observe the reason of this  \\n\\nyes   the reason is   that the whole city is leagued together for the\\nprotection of each individual  \\n\\nvery true   i said   but imagine one of these owners   the master say of\\nsome fifty slaves   together with his family and property and slaves  \\ncarried off by a god into the wilderness   where there are no freemen to\\nhelp him—will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and\\nchildren should be put to death by his slaves  \\n\\nyes   he said   he will be in the utmost fear  \\n\\nthe time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of his\\nslaves   and make many promises to them of freedom and other things  \\nmuch against his will—he will have to cajole his own servants  \\n\\nyes   he said   that will be the only way of saving himself  \\n\\nand suppose the same god   who carried him away   to surround him with\\nneighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another   and\\nwho   if they could catch the offender   would take his life  \\n\\nhis case will be still worse   if you suppose him to be everywhere\\nsurrounded and watched by enemies  \\n\\nand is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound—he\\nwho being by nature such as we have described   is full of all sorts of\\nfears and lusts   his soul is dainty and greedy   and yet alone   of all\\nmen in the city   he is never allowed to go on a journey   or to see the\\nthings which other freemen desire to see   but he lives in his hole like\\na woman hidden in the house   and is jealous of any other citizen who\\ngoes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nand amid evils such as these will not he who is ill  governed in his own\\nperson—the tyrannical man   i mean—whom you just now decided to be the\\nmost miserable of all—will not he be yet more miserable when   instead\\nof leading a private life   he is constrained by fortune to be a public\\ntyrant   he has to be master of others when he is not master of himself  \\nhe is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his\\nlife   not in retirement   but fighting and combating with other men  \\n\\nyes   he said   the similitude is most exact  \\n\\nis not his case utterly miserable   and does not the actual tyrant lead\\na worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nhe who is the real tyrant   whatever men may think   is the real slave  \\nand is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility   and to\\nbe the flatterer of the vilest of mankind   he has desires which he is\\nutterly unable to satisfy   and has more wants than any one   and is\\ntruly poor   if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him   all his\\nlife long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions and\\ndistractions   even as the state which he resembles   and surely the\\nresemblance holds  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nmoreover   as we were saying before   he grows worse from having power  \\nhe becomes and is of necessity more jealous   more faithless   more\\nunjust   more friendless   more impious   than he was at first   he is the\\npurveyor and cherisher of every sort of vice   and the consequence is\\nthat he is supremely miserable   and that he makes everybody else as\\nmiserable as himself  \\n\\nno man of any sense will dispute your words  \\n\\ncome then   i said   and as the general umpire in theatrical contests\\nproclaims the result   do you also decide who in your opinion is first\\nin the scale of happiness   and who second   and in what order the others\\nfollow   there are five of them in all—they are the royal   timocratical  \\noligarchical   democratical   tyrannical  \\n\\nthe decision will be easily given   he replied   they shall be choruses\\ncoming on the stage   and i must judge them in the order in which they\\nenter   by the criterion of virtue and vice   happiness and misery  \\n\\nneed we hire a herald   or shall i announce   that the son of ariston\\n  the best   has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest  \\nand that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself  \\nand that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable   and\\nthat this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the\\ngreatest tyrant of his state  \\n\\nmake the proclamation yourself   he said  \\n\\nand shall i add     whether seen or unseen by gods and men    \\n\\nlet the words be added  \\n\\nthen this   i said   will be our first proof   and there is another   which\\nmay also have some weight  \\n\\nwhat is that  \\n\\nthe second proof is derived from the nature of the soul   seeing that\\nthe individual soul   like the state   has been divided by us into three\\nprinciples   the division may   i think   furnish a new demonstration  \\n\\nof what nature  \\n\\nit seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures\\ncorrespond   also three desires and governing powers  \\n\\nhow do you mean   he said  \\n\\nthere is one principle with which   as we were saying   a man learns  \\nanother with which he is angry   the third   having many forms   has no\\nspecial name   but is denoted by the general term appetitive   from the\\nextraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and\\ndrinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of\\nit   also money  loving   because such desires are generally satisfied by\\nthe help of money  \\n\\nthat is true   he said  \\n\\nif we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were\\nconcerned with gain   we should then be able to fall back on a single\\nnotion   and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul\\nas loving gain or money  \\n\\ni agree with you  \\n\\nagain   is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and\\nconquering and getting fame  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nsuppose we call it the contentious or ambitious—would the term be\\nsuitable  \\n\\nextremely suitable  \\n\\non the other hand   every one sees that the principle of knowledge is\\nwholly directed to the truth   and cares less than either of the others\\nfor gain or fame  \\n\\nfar less  \\n\\n  lover of wisdom       lover of knowledge     are titles which we may fitly\\napply to that part of the soul  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\none principle prevails in the souls of one class of men   another in\\nothers   as may happen  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthen we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of\\nmen—lovers of wisdom   lovers of honour   lovers of gain  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nand there are three kinds of pleasure   which are their several objects  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nnow   if you examine the three classes of men   and ask of them in turn\\nwhich of their lives is pleasantest   each will be found praising his\\nown and depreciating that of others   the money  maker will contrast the\\nvanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid\\nadvantages of gold and silver  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nand the lover of honour—what will be his opinion   will he not think\\nthat the pleasure of riches is vulgar   while the pleasure of learning  \\nif it brings no distinction   is all smoke and nonsense to him  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand are we to suppose   i said   that the philosopher sets any value on\\nother pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth  \\nand in that pursuit abiding   ever learning   not so far indeed from the\\nheaven of pleasure   does he not call the other pleasures necessary  \\nunder the idea that if there were no necessity for them   he would\\nrather not have them  \\n\\nthere can be no doubt of that   he replied  \\n\\nsince   then   the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in\\ndispute   and the question is not which life is more or less honourable  \\nor better or worse   but which is the more pleasant or painless—how\\nshall we know who speaks truly  \\n\\ni cannot myself tell   he said  \\n\\nwell   but what ought to be the criterion   is any better than experience\\nand wisdom and reason  \\n\\nthere cannot be a better   he said  \\n\\nthen   i said   reflect   of the three individuals   which has the greatest\\nexperience of all the pleasures which we enumerated   has the lover of\\ngain   in learning the nature of essential truth   greater experience of\\nthe pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of\\ngain  \\n\\nthe philosopher   he replied   has greatly the advantage   for he has of\\nnecessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his\\nchildhood upwards   but the lover of gain in all his experience has not\\nof necessity tasted—or   i should rather say   even had he desired   could\\nhardly have tasted—the sweetness of learning and knowing truth  \\n\\nthen the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain  \\nfor he has a double experience  \\n\\nyes   very great  \\n\\nagain   has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour   or the\\nlover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom  \\n\\nnay   he said   all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their\\nobject   for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have\\ntheir crowd of admirers   and as they all receive honour they all have\\nexperience of the pleasures of honour   but the delight which is to be\\nfound in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only  \\n\\nhis experience   then   will enable him to judge better than any one  \\n\\nfar better  \\n\\nand he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nfurther   the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not\\npossessed by the covetous or ambitious man   but only by the\\nphilosopher  \\n\\nwhat faculty  \\n\\nreason   with whom   as we were saying   the decision ought to rest  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand reasoning is peculiarly his instrument  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nif wealth and gain were the criterion   then the praise or blame of the\\nlover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy  \\n\\nassuredly  \\n\\nor if honour or victory or courage   in that case the judgment of the\\nambitious or pugnacious would be the truest  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nbut since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges—\\n\\nthe only inference possible   he replied   is that pleasures which are\\napproved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest  \\n\\nand so we arrive at the result   that the pleasure of the intelligent\\npart of the soul is the pleasantest of the three   and that he of us in\\nwhom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life  \\n\\nunquestionably   he said   the wise man speaks with authority when he\\napproves of his own life  \\n\\nand what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next   and the\\npleasure which is next  \\n\\nclearly that of the soldier and lover of honour   who is nearer to\\nhimself than the money  maker  \\n\\nlast comes the lover of gain  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\ntwice in succession   then   has the just man overthrown the unjust in\\nthis conflict   and now comes the third trial   which is dedicated to\\nolympian zeus the saviour   a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure\\nexcept that of the wise is quite true and pure—all others are a shadow\\nonly   and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of\\nfalls  \\n\\nyes   the greatest   but will you explain yourself  \\n\\ni will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions  \\n\\nproceed  \\n\\nsay   then   is not pleasure opposed to pain  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain  \\n\\nthere is  \\n\\na state which is intermediate   and a sort of repose of the soul about\\neither—that is what you mean  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nyou remember what people say when they are sick  \\n\\nwhat do they say  \\n\\nthat after all nothing is pleasanter than health   but then they never\\nknew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill  \\n\\nyes   i know   he said  \\n\\nand when persons are suffering from acute pain   you must have heard\\nthem say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their\\npain  \\n\\ni have  \\n\\nand there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and\\ncessation of pain   and not any positive enjoyment   is extolled by them\\nas the greatest pleasure  \\n\\nyes   he said   at the time they are pleased and well content to be at\\nrest  \\n\\nagain   when pleasure ceases   that sort of rest or cessation will be\\npainful  \\n\\ndoubtless   he said  \\n\\nthen the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be\\npain  \\n\\nso it would seem  \\n\\nbut can that which is neither become both  \\n\\ni should say not  \\n\\nand both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul   are they not  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nbut that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion  \\nand in a mean between them  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nhow   then   can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is\\npleasure   or that the absence of pleasure is pain  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nthis then is an appearance only and not a reality   that is to say   the\\nrest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful  \\nand painful in comparison of what is pleasant   but all these\\nrepresentations   when tried by the test of true pleasure   are not real\\nbut a sort of imposition  \\n\\nthat is the inference  \\n\\nlook at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains and\\nyou will no longer suppose   as you perhaps may at present   that\\npleasure is only the cessation of pain   or pain of pleasure  \\n\\nwhat are they   he said   and where shall i find them  \\n\\nthere are many of them   take as an example the pleasures of smell  \\nwhich are very great and have no antecedent pains   they come in a\\nmoment   and when they depart leave no pain behind them  \\n\\nmost true   he said  \\n\\nlet us not   then   be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the\\ncessation of pain   or pain of pleasure  \\n\\nno  \\n\\nstill   the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul\\nthrough the body are generally of this sort—they are reliefs of pain  \\n\\nthat is true  \\n\\nand the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like\\nnature  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nshall i give you an illustration of them  \\n\\nlet me hear  \\n\\nyou would allow   i said   that there is in nature an upper and lower and\\nmiddle region  \\n\\ni should  \\n\\nand if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region   would\\nhe not imagine that he is going up   and he who is standing in the\\nmiddle and sees whence he has come   would imagine that he is already in\\nthe upper region   if he has never seen the true upper world  \\n\\nto be sure   he said   how can he think otherwise  \\n\\nbut if he were taken back again he would imagine   and truly imagine  \\nthat he was descending  \\n\\nno doubt  \\n\\nall that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle\\nand lower regions  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthen can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth   as\\nthey have wrong ideas about many other things   should also have wrong\\nideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state   so that when\\nthey are only being drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think\\nthe pain which they experience to be real   and in like manner   when\\ndrawn away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state   they firmly\\nbelieve that they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure   they  \\nnot knowing pleasure   err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain  \\nwhich is like contrasting black with grey instead of white—can you\\nwonder   i say   at this  \\n\\nno   indeed   i should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite  \\n\\nlook at the matter thus  —hunger   thirst   and the like   are inanitions\\nof the bodily state  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that\\nwhich has more existence the truer  \\n\\nclearly   from that which has more  \\n\\nwhat classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your\\njudgment—those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of\\nsustenance are examples   or the class which contains true opinion and\\nknowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue   put the\\nquestion in this way  —which has a more pure being—that which is\\nconcerned with the invariable   the immortal   and the true   and is of\\nsuch a nature   and is found in such natures   or that which is concerned\\nwith and found in the variable and mortal   and is itself variable and\\nmortal  \\n\\nfar purer   he replied   is the being of that which is concerned with the\\ninvariable  \\n\\nand does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same\\ndegree as of essence  \\n\\nyes   of knowledge in the same degree  \\n\\nand of truth in the same degree  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand   conversely   that which has less of truth will also have less of\\nessence  \\n\\nnecessarily  \\n\\nthen   in general   those kinds of things which are in the service of the\\nbody have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service\\nof the soul  \\n\\nfar less  \\n\\nand has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nwhat is filled with more real existence   and actually has a more real\\nexistence   is more really filled than that which is filled with less\\nreal existence and is less real  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nand if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according\\nto nature   that which is more really filled with more real being will\\nmore really and truly enjoy true pleasure   whereas that which\\nparticipates in less real being will be less truly and surely\\nsatisfied   and will participate in an illusory and less real pleasure  \\n\\nunquestionably  \\n\\nthose then who know not wisdom and virtue   and are always busy with\\ngluttony and sensuality   go down and up again as far as the mean   and\\nin this region they move at random throughout life   but they never pass\\ninto the true upper world   thither they neither look   nor do they ever\\nfind their way   neither are they truly filled with true being   nor do\\nthey taste of pure and abiding pleasure   like cattle   with their eyes\\nalways looking down and their heads stooping to the earth   that is   to\\nthe dining  table   they fatten and feed and breed   and   in their\\nexcessive love of these delights   they kick and butt at one another\\nwith horns and hoofs which are made of iron   and they kill one another\\nby reason of their insatiable lust   for they fill themselves with that\\nwhich is not substantial   and the part of themselves which they fill is\\nalso unsubstantial and incontinent  \\n\\nverily   socrates   said glaucon   you describe the life of the many like\\nan oracle  \\n\\ntheir pleasures are mixed with pains—how can they be otherwise   for\\nthey are mere shadows and pictures of the true   and are coloured by\\ncontrast   which exaggerates both light and shade   and so they implant\\nin the minds of fools insane desires of themselves   and they are fought\\nabout as stesichorus says that the greeks fought about the shadow of\\nhelen at troy in ignorance of the truth  \\n\\nsomething of that sort must inevitably happen  \\n\\nand must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of\\nthe soul   will not the passionate man who carries his passion into\\naction   be in the like case   whether he is envious and ambitious   or\\nviolent and contentious   or angry and discontented   if he be seeking to\\nattain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without\\nreason or sense  \\n\\nyes   he said   the same will happen with the spirited element also  \\n\\nthen may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour  \\nwhen they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of\\nreason and knowledge   and pursue after and win the pleasures which\\nwisdom shows them   will also have the truest pleasures in the highest\\ndegree which is attainable to them   inasmuch as they follow truth   and\\nthey will have the pleasures which are natural to them   if that which\\nis best for each one is also most natural to him  \\n\\nyes   certainly   the best is the most natural  \\n\\nand when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle   and there\\nis no division   the several parts are just   and do each of them their\\nown business   and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of\\nwhich they are capable  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nbut when either of the two other principles prevails   it fails in\\nattaining its own pleasure   and compels the rest to pursue after a\\npleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and\\nreason   the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance\\nfrom law and order  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nand the lustful and tyrannical desires are   as we saw   at the greatest\\ndistance   yes  \\n\\nand the royal and orderly desires are nearest  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthen the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural\\npleasure   and the king at the least  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nbut if so   the tyrant will live most unpleasantly   and the king most\\npleasantly  \\n\\ninevitably  \\n\\nwould you know the measure of the interval which separates them  \\n\\nwill you tell me  \\n\\nthere appear to be three pleasures   one genuine and two spurious   now\\nthe transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious   he\\nhas run away from the region of law and reason   and taken up his abode\\nwith certain slave pleasures which are his satellites   and the measure\\nof his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure  \\n\\nhow do you mean  \\n\\ni assume   i said   that the tyrant is in the third place from the\\noligarch   the democrat was in the middle  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand if there is truth in what has preceded   he will be wedded to an\\nimage of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure\\nof the oligarch  \\n\\nhe will  \\n\\nand the oligarch is third from the royal   since we count as one royal\\nand aristocratical  \\n\\nyes   he is third  \\n\\nthen the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number\\nwhich is three times three  \\n\\nmanifestly  \\n\\nthe shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of\\nlength will be a plane figure  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand if you raise the power and make the plane a solid   there is no\\ndifficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is\\nparted from the king  \\n\\nyes   the arithmetician will easily do the sum  \\n\\nor if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval by\\nwhich the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure   he will\\nfind him   when the multiplication is completed   living 729 times more\\npleasantly   and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval  \\n\\nwhat a wonderful calculation   and how enormous is the distance which\\nseparates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain  \\n\\nyet a true calculation   i said   and a number which nearly concerns\\nhuman life   if human beings are concerned with days and nights and\\nmonths and years     729 nearly equals the number of days and nights in\\nthe year    \\n\\nyes   he said   human life is certainly concerned with them  \\n\\nthen if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil\\nand unjust   his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of\\nlife and in beauty and virtue  \\n\\nimmeasurably greater  \\n\\nwell   i said   and now having arrived at this stage of the argument   we\\nmay revert to the words which brought us hither   was not some one\\nsaying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was\\nreputed to be just  \\n\\nyes   that was said  \\n\\nnow then   having determined the power and quality of justice and\\ninjustice   let us have a little conversation with him  \\n\\nwhat shall we say to him  \\n\\nlet us make an image of the soul   that he may have his own words\\npresented before his eyes  \\n\\nof what sort  \\n\\nan ideal image of the soul   like the composite creations of ancient\\nmythology   such as the chimera or scylla or cerberus   and there are\\nmany others in which two or more different natures are said to grow\\ninto one  \\n\\nthere are said of have been such unions  \\n\\nthen do you now model the form of a multitudinous   many  headed monster  \\nhaving a ring of heads of all manner of beasts   tame and wild   which he\\nis able to generate and metamorphose at will  \\n\\nyou suppose marvellous powers in the artist   but   as language is more\\npliable than wax or any similar substance   let there be such a model as\\nyou propose  \\n\\nsuppose now that you make a second form as of a lion   and a third of a\\nman   the second smaller than the first   and the third smaller than the\\nsecond  \\n\\nthat   he said   is an easier task   and i have made them as you say  \\n\\nand now join them   and let the three grow into one  \\n\\nthat has been accomplished  \\n\\nnext fashion the outside of them into a single image   as of a man   so\\nthat he who is not able to look within   and sees only the outer hull  \\nmay believe the beast to be a single human creature  \\n\\ni have done so   he said  \\n\\nand now   to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human\\ncreature to be unjust   and unprofitable to be just   let us reply that  \\nif he be right   it is profitable for this creature to feast the\\nmultitudinous monster and strengthen the lion and the lion  like\\nqualities   but to starve and weaken the man   who is consequently liable\\nto be dragged about at the mercy of either of the other two   and he is\\nnot to attempt to familiarize or harmonize them with one another—he\\nought rather to suffer them to fight and bite and devour one another  \\n\\ncertainly   he said   that is what the approver of injustice says  \\n\\nto him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so\\nspeak and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the\\nmost complete mastery over the entire human creature   he should watch\\nover the many  headed monster like a good husbandman   fostering and\\ncultivating the gentle qualities   and preventing the wild ones from\\ngrowing   he should be making the lion  heart his ally   and in common\\ncare of them all should be uniting the several parts with one another\\nand with himself  \\n\\nyes   he said   that is quite what the maintainer of justice say  \\n\\nand so from every point of view   whether of pleasure   honour   or\\nadvantage   the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth   and\\nthe disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant  \\n\\nyes   from every point of view  \\n\\ncome   now   and let us gently reason with the unjust   who is not\\nintentionally in error     sweet sir     we will say to him     what think\\nyou of things esteemed noble and ignoble   is not the noble that which\\nsubjects the beast to the man   or rather to the god in man   and the\\nignoble that which subjects the man to the beast     he can hardly avoid\\nsaying yes—can he now  \\n\\nnot if he has any regard for my opinion  \\n\\nbut   if he agree so far   we may ask him to answer another question  \\n  then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the\\ncondition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst  \\nwho can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery\\nfor money   especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil\\nmen   would be the gainer   however large might be the sum which he\\nreceived   and will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff who\\nremorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most godless\\nand detestable   eriphyle took the necklace as the price of her\\nhusband  s life   but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a worse\\nruin    \\n\\nyes   said glaucon   far worse—i will answer for him  \\n\\nhas not the intemperate been censured of old   because in him the huge\\nmultiform monster is allowed to be too much at large  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nand men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent\\nelement in them disproportionately grows and gains strength  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand luxury and softness are blamed   because they relax and weaken this\\nsame creature   and make a coward of him  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates\\nthe spirited animal to the unruly monster   and   for the sake of money  \\nof which he can never have enough   habituates him in the days of his\\nyouth to be trampled in the mire   and from being a lion to become a\\nmonkey  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nand why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach   only because\\nthey imply a natural weakness of the higher principle   the individual\\nis unable to control the creatures within him   but has to court them  \\nand his great study is how to flatter them  \\n\\nsuch appears to be the reason  \\n\\nand therefore   being desirous of placing him under a rule like that of\\nthe best   we say that he ought to be the servant of the best   in whom\\nthe divine rules   not   as thrasymachus supposed   to the injury of the\\nservant   but because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom\\ndwelling within him   or   if this be impossible   then by an external\\nauthority   in order that we may be all   as far as possible   under the\\nsame government   friends and equals  \\n\\ntrue   he said  \\n\\nand this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law   which is the\\nally of the whole city   and is seen also in the authority which we\\nexercise over children   and the refusal to let them be free until we\\nhave established in them a principle analogous to the constitution of a\\nstate   and by cultivation of this higher element have set up in their\\nhearts a guardian and ruler like our own   and when this is done they\\nmay go their ways  \\n\\nyes   he said   the purpose of the law is manifest  \\n\\nfrom what point of view   then   and on what ground can we say that a man\\nis profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness   which will\\nmake him a worse man   even though he acquire money or power by his\\nwickedness  \\n\\nfrom no point of view at all  \\n\\nwhat shall he profit   if his injustice be undetected and unpunished   he\\nwho is undetected only gets worse   whereas he who is detected and\\npunished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized   the\\ngentler element in him is liberated   and his whole soul is perfected\\nand ennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom  \\nmore than the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty   strength and\\nhealth   in proportion as the soul is more honourable than the body  \\n\\ncertainly   he said  \\n\\nto this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the\\nenergies of his life   and in the first place   he will honour studies\\nwhich impress these qualities on his soul and will disregard others  \\n\\nclearly   he said  \\n\\nin the next place   he will regulate his bodily habit and training   and\\nso far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures  \\nthat he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter   his first\\nobject will be not that he may be fair or strong or well   unless he is\\nlikely thereby to gain temperance   but he will always desire so to\\nattemper the body as to preserve the harmony of the soul  \\n\\ncertainly he will   if he has true music in him  \\n\\nand in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and\\nharmony which he will also observe   he will not allow himself to be\\ndazzled by the foolish applause of the world   and heap up riches to his\\nown infinite harm  \\n\\ncertainly not   he said  \\n\\nhe will look at the city which is within him   and take heed that no\\ndisorder occur in it   such as might arise either from superfluity or\\nfrom want   and upon this principle he will regulate his property and\\ngain or spend according to his means  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand   for the same reason   he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours\\nas he deems likely to make him a better man   but those   whether private\\nor public   which are likely to disorder his life   he will avoid  \\n\\nthen   if that is his motive   he will not be a statesman  \\n\\nby the dog of egypt   he will   in the city which is his own he certainly\\nwill   though in the land of his birth perhaps not   unless he have a\\ndivine call  \\n\\ni understand   you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we\\nare the founders   and which exists in idea only   for i do not believe\\nthat there is such an one anywhere on earth  \\n\\nin heaven   i replied   there is laid up a pattern of it   methinks   which\\nhe who desires may behold   and beholding   may set his own house in\\norder   but whether such an one exists   or ever will exist in fact   is\\nno matter   for he will live after the manner of that city   having\\nnothing to do with any other  \\n\\ni think so   he said  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n book x  \\n\\n\\nof the many excellences which i perceive in the order of our state  \\nthere is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule\\nabout poetry  \\n\\nto what do you refer  \\n\\nto the rejection of imitative poetry   which certainly ought not to be\\nreceived   as i see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have\\nbeen distinguished  \\n\\nwhat do you mean  \\n\\nspeaking in confidence   for i should not like to have my words repeated\\nto the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe—but i do not mind\\nsaying to you   that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the\\nunderstanding of the hearers   and that the knowledge of their true\\nnature is the only antidote to them  \\n\\nexplain the purport of your remark  \\n\\nwell   i will tell you   although i have always from my earliest youth\\nhad an awe and love of homer   which even now makes the words falter on\\nmy lips   for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that\\ncharming tragic company   but a man is not to be reverenced more than\\nthe truth   and therefore i will speak out  \\n\\nvery good   he said  \\n\\nlisten to me then   or rather   answer me  \\n\\nput your question  \\n\\ncan you tell me what imitation is   for i really do not know  \\n\\na likely thing   then   that i should know  \\n\\nwhy not   for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the\\nkeener  \\n\\nvery true   he said   but in your presence   even if i had any faint\\nnotion   i could not muster courage to utter it   will you enquire\\nyourself  \\n\\nwell then   shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner   whenever a\\nnumber of individuals have a common name   we assume them to have also a\\ncorresponding idea or form  —do you understand me  \\n\\ni do  \\n\\nlet us take any common instance   there are beds and tables in the\\nworld—plenty of them   are there not  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nbut there are only two ideas or forms of them—one the idea of a bed  \\nthe other of a table  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our\\nuse   in accordance with the idea—that is our way of speaking in this\\nand similar instances—but no artificer makes the ideas themselves   how\\ncould he  \\n\\nimpossible  \\n\\nand there is another artist  —i should like to know what you would say\\nof him  \\n\\nwho is he  \\n\\none who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen  \\n\\nwhat an extraordinary man  \\n\\nwait a little   and there will be more reason for your saying so   for\\nthis is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind   but\\nplants and animals   himself and all other things—the earth and heaven  \\nand the things which are in heaven or under the earth   he makes the\\ngods also  \\n\\nhe must be a wizard and no mistake  \\n\\noh   you are incredulous   are you   do you mean that there is no such\\nmaker or creator   or that in one sense there might be a maker of all\\nthese things but in another not   do you see that there is a way in\\nwhich you could make them all yourself  \\n\\nwhat way  \\n\\nan easy way enough   or rather   there are many ways in which the feat\\nmight be quickly and easily accomplished   none quicker than that of\\nturning a mirror round and round—you would soon enough make the sun and\\nthe heavens   and the earth and yourself   and other animals and plants  \\nand all the other things of which we were just now speaking   in the\\nmirror  \\n\\nyes   he said   but they would be appearances only  \\n\\nvery good   i said   you are coming to the point now   and the painter too\\nis   as i conceive   just such another—a creator of appearances   is he\\nnot  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nbut then i suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue   and yet\\nthere is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed  \\n\\nyes   he said   but not a real bed  \\n\\nand what of the maker of the bed   were you not saying that he too\\nmakes   not the idea which   according to our view   is the essence of the\\nbed   but only a particular bed  \\n\\nyes   i did  \\n\\nthen if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true\\nexistence   but only some semblance of existence   and if any one were to\\nsay that the work of the maker of the bed   or of any other workman   has\\nreal existence   he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth  \\n\\nat any rate   he replied   philosophers would say that he was not\\nspeaking the truth  \\n\\nno wonder   then   that his work too is an indistinct expression of\\ntruth  \\n\\nno wonder  \\n\\nsuppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire\\nwho this imitator is  \\n\\nif you please  \\n\\nwell then   here are three beds   one existing in nature   which is made\\nby god   as i think that we may say—for no one else can be the maker  \\n\\nno  \\n\\nthere is another which is the work of the carpenter  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand the work of the painter is a third  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nbeds   then   are of three kinds   and there are three artists who\\nsuperintend them   god   the maker of the bed   and the painter  \\n\\nyes   there are three of them  \\n\\ngod   whether from choice or from necessity   made one bed in nature and\\none only   two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever\\nwill be made by god  \\n\\nwhy is that  \\n\\nbecause even if he had made but two   a third would still appear behind\\nthem which both of them would have for their idea   and that would be\\nthe ideal bed and not the two others  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\ngod knew this   and he desired to be the real maker of a real bed   not a\\nparticular maker of a particular bed   and therefore he created a bed\\nwhich is essentially and by nature one only  \\n\\nso we believe  \\n\\nshall we   then   speak of him as the natural author or maker of the bed  \\n\\nyes   he replied   inasmuch as by the natural process of creation he is\\nthe author of this and of all other things  \\n\\nand what shall we say of the carpenter—is not he also the maker of the\\nbed  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nbut would you call the painter a creator and maker  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nyet if he is not the maker   what is he in relation to the bed  \\n\\ni think   he said   that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of\\nthat which the others make  \\n\\ngood   i said   then you call him who is third in the descent from nature\\nan imitator  \\n\\ncertainly   he said  \\n\\nand the tragic poet is an imitator   and therefore   like all other\\nimitators   he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth  \\n\\nthat appears to be so  \\n\\nthen about the imitator we are agreed   and what about the painter  —i\\nwould like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which\\noriginally exists in nature   or only the creations of artists  \\n\\nthe latter  \\n\\nas they are or as they appear   you have still to determine this  \\n\\nwhat do you mean  \\n\\ni mean   that you may look at a bed from different points of view  \\nobliquely or directly or from any other point of view   and the bed will\\nappear different   but there is no difference in reality   and the same\\nof all things  \\n\\nyes   he said   the difference is only apparent  \\n\\nnow let me ask you another question   which is the art of painting\\ndesigned to be—an imitation of things as they are   or as they appear—of\\nappearance or of reality  \\n\\nof appearance  \\n\\nthen the imitator   i said   is a long way off the truth   and can do all\\nthings because he lightly touches on a small part of them   and that\\npart an image   for example   a painter will paint a cobbler   carpenter  \\nor any other artist   though he knows nothing of their arts   and   if he\\nis a good artist   he may deceive children or simple persons   when he\\nshows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance   and they will\\nfancy that they are looking at a real carpenter  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all\\nthe arts   and all things else that anybody knows   and every single\\nthing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man—whoever tells\\nus this   i think that we can only imagine him to be a simple creature\\nwho is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he\\nmet   and whom he thought all  knowing   because he himself was unable to\\nanalyse the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation  \\n\\nmost true  \\n\\nand so   when we hear persons saying that the tragedians   and homer   who\\nis at their head   know all the arts and all things human   virtue as\\nwell as vice   and divine things too   for that the good poet cannot\\ncompose well unless he knows his subject   and that he who has not this\\nknowledge can never be a poet   we ought to consider whether here also\\nthere may not be a similar illusion   perhaps they may have come across\\nimitators and been deceived by them   they may not have remembered when\\nthey saw their works that these were but imitations thrice removed from\\nthe truth   and could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth  \\nbecause they are appearances only and not realities   or   after all  \\nthey may be in the right   and poets do really know the things about\\nwhich they seem to the many to speak so well  \\n\\nthe question   he said   should by all means be considered  \\n\\nnow do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as\\nwell as the image   he would seriously devote himself to the\\nimage  making branch   would he allow imitation to be the ruling\\nprinciple of his life   as if he had nothing higher in him  \\n\\ni should say not  \\n\\nthe real artist   who knew what he was imitating   would be interested in\\nrealities and not in imitations   and would desire to leave as memorials\\nof himself works many and fair   and   instead of being the author of\\nencomiums   he would prefer to be the theme of them  \\n\\nyes   he said   that would be to him a source of much greater honour and\\nprofit  \\n\\nthen   i said   we must put a question to homer   not about medicine   or\\nany of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer   we are not\\ngoing to ask him   or any other poet   whether he has cured patients like\\nasclepius   or left behind him a school of medicine such as the\\nasclepiads were   or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts\\nat second  hand   but we have a right to know respecting military\\ntactics   politics   education   which are the chiefest and noblest\\nsubjects of his poems   and we may fairly ask him about them     friend\\nhomer     then we say to him     if you are only in the second remove from\\ntruth in what you say of virtue   and not in the third—not an image\\nmaker or imitator—and if you are able to discern what pursuits make men\\nbetter or worse in private or public life   tell us what state was ever\\nbetter governed by your help   the good order of lacedaemon is due to\\nlycurgus   and many other cities great and small have been similarly\\nbenefited by others   but who says that you have been a good legislator\\nto them and have done them any good   italy and sicily boast of\\ncharondas   and there is solon who is renowned among us   but what city\\nhas anything to say about you     is there any city which he might name  \\n\\ni think not   said glaucon   not even the homerids themselves pretend\\nthat he was a legislator  \\n\\nwell   but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully\\nby him   or aided by his counsels   when he was alive  \\n\\nthere is not  \\n\\nor is there any invention of his   applicable to the arts or to human\\nlife   such as thales the milesian or anacharsis the scythian   and other\\ningenious men have conceived   which is attributed to him  \\n\\nthere is absolutely nothing of the kind  \\n\\nbut   if homer never did any public service   was he privately a guide or\\nteacher of any   had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate\\nwith him   and who handed down to posterity an homeric way of life   such\\nas was established by pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his\\nwisdom   and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the\\norder which was named after him  \\n\\nnothing of the kind is recorded of him   for surely   socrates  \\ncreophylus   the companion of homer   that child of flesh   whose name\\nalways makes us laugh   might be more justly ridiculed for his\\nstupidity   if   as is said   homer was greatly neglected by him and\\nothers in his own day when he was alive  \\n\\nyes   i replied   that is the tradition   but can you imagine   glaucon  \\nthat if homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind—if he\\nhad possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator—can you imagine   i\\nsay   that he would not have had many followers   and been honoured and\\nloved by them   protagoras of abdera   and prodicus of ceos   and a host\\nof others   have only to whisper to their contemporaries     you will\\nnever be able to manage either your own house or your own state until\\nyou appoint us to be your ministers of education  —and this ingenious\\ndevice of theirs has such an effect in making men love them that their\\ncompanions all but carry them about on their shoulders   and is it\\nconceivable that the contemporaries of homer   or again of hesiod   would\\nhave allowed either of them to go about as rhapsodists   if they had\\nreally been able to make mankind virtuous   would they not have been as\\nunwilling to part with them as with gold   and have compelled them to\\nstay at home with them   or   if the master would not stay   then the\\ndisciples would have followed him about everywhere   until they had got\\neducation enough  \\n\\nyes   socrates   that   i think   is quite true  \\n\\nthen must we not infer that all these poetical individuals   beginning\\nwith homer   are only imitators   they copy images of virtue and the\\nlike   but the truth they never reach   the poet is like a painter who  \\nas we have already observed   will make a likeness of a cobbler though\\nhe understands nothing of cobbling   and his picture is good enough for\\nthose who know no more than he does   and judge only by colours and\\nfigures  \\n\\nquite so  \\n\\nin like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to lay\\non the colours of the several arts   himself understanding their nature\\nonly enough to imitate them   and other people   who are as ignorant as\\nhe is   and judge only from his words   imagine that if he speaks of\\ncobbling   or of military tactics   or of anything else   in metre and\\nharmony and rhythm   he speaks very well—such is the sweet influence\\nwhich melody and rhythm by nature have   and i think that you must have\\nobserved again and again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make\\nwhen stripped of the colours which music puts upon them   and recited in\\nsimple prose  \\n\\nyes   he said  \\n\\nthey are like faces which were never really beautiful   but only\\nblooming   and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nhere is another point   the imitator or maker of the image knows nothing\\nof true existence   he knows appearances only   am i not right  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nthen let us have a clear understanding   and not be satisfied with half\\nan explanation  \\n\\nproceed  \\n\\nof the painter we say that he will paint reins   and he will paint a\\nbit  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand the worker in leather and brass will make them  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nbut does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins   nay  \\nhardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them   only the\\nhorseman who knows how to use them—he knows their right form  \\n\\nmost true  \\n\\nand may we not say the same of all things  \\n\\nwhat  \\n\\nthat there are three arts which are concerned with all things   one\\nwhich uses   another which makes   a third which imitates them  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure   animate or\\ninanimate   and of every action of man   is relative to the use for which\\nnature or the artist has intended them  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthen the user of them must have the greatest experience of them   and he\\nmust indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop\\nthemselves in use   for example   the flute  player will tell the\\nflute  maker which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer   he\\nwill tell him how he ought to make them   and the other will attend to\\nhis instructions  \\n\\nof course  \\n\\nthe one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness\\nand badness of flutes   while the other   confiding in him   will do what\\nhe is told by him  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthe instrument is the same   but about the excellence or badness of it\\nthe maker will only attain to a correct belief   and this he will gain\\nfrom him who knows   by talking to him and being compelled to hear what\\nhe has to say   whereas the user will have knowledge  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nbut will the imitator have either   will he know from use whether or no\\nhis drawing is correct or beautiful   or will he have right opinion from\\nbeing compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him\\ninstructions about what he should draw  \\n\\nneither  \\n\\nthen he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge\\nabout the goodness or badness of his imitations  \\n\\ni suppose not  \\n\\nthe imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about\\nhis own creations  \\n\\nnay   very much the reverse  \\n\\nand still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing\\ngood or bad   and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which\\nappears to be good to the ignorant multitude  \\n\\njust so  \\n\\nthus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no\\nknowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates   imitation is only a\\nkind of play or sport   and the tragic poets   whether they write in\\niambic or in heroic verse   are imitators in the highest degree  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand now tell me   i conjure you   has not imitation been shown by us to\\nbe concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed  \\n\\nwhat do you mean  \\n\\ni will explain   the body which is large when seen near   appears small\\nwhen seen at a distance  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water  \\nand crooked when in the water   and the concave becomes convex   owing to\\nthe illusion about colours to which the sight is liable   thus every\\nsort of confusion is revealed within us   and this is that weakness of\\nthe human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light\\nand shadow and other ingenious devices imposes   having an effect upon\\nus like magic  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue\\nof the human understanding—there is the beauty of them—and the apparent\\ngreater or less   or more or heavier   no longer have the mastery over\\nus   but give way before calculation and measure and weight  \\n\\nmost true  \\n\\nand this   surely   must be the work of the calculating and rational\\nprinciple in the soul  \\n\\nto be sure  \\n\\nand when this principle measures and certifies that some things are\\nequal   or that some are greater or less than others   there occurs an\\napparent contradiction  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nbut were we not saying that such a contradiction is impossible—the same\\nfaculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same\\nthing  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nthen that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is\\nnot the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to\\nmeasure and calculation  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of\\nthe soul  \\n\\nno doubt  \\n\\nthis was the conclusion at which i was seeking to arrive when i said\\nthat painting or drawing   and imitation in general   when doing their\\nown proper work   are far removed from truth   and the companions and\\nfriends and associates of a principle within us which is equally\\nremoved from reason   and that they have no true or healthy aim  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nthe imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior   and has\\ninferior offspring  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand is this confined to the sight only   or does it extend to the\\nhearing also   relating in fact to what we term poetry  \\n\\nprobably the same would be true of poetry  \\n\\ndo not rely   i said   on a probability derived from the analogy of\\npainting   but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with\\nwhich poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad  \\n\\nby all means  \\n\\nwe may state the question thus  —imitation imitates the actions of men  \\nwhether voluntary or involuntary   on which   as they imagine   a good or\\nbad result has ensued   and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly   is there\\nanything more  \\n\\nno   there is nothing else  \\n\\nbut in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with\\nhimself—or rather   as in the instance of sight there was confusion and\\nopposition in his opinions about the same things   so here also is there\\nnot strife and inconsistency in his life   though i need hardly raise\\nthe question again   for i remember that all this has been already\\nadmitted   and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these\\nand ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment  \\n\\nand we were right   he said  \\n\\nyes   i said   thus far we were right   but there was an omission which\\nmust now be supplied  \\n\\nwhat was the omission  \\n\\nwere we not saying that a good man   who has the misfortune to lose his\\nson or anything else which is most dear to him   will bear the loss with\\nmore equanimity than another  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nbut will he have no sorrow   or shall we say that although he cannot\\nhelp sorrowing   he will moderate his sorrow  \\n\\nthe latter   he said   is the truer statement  \\n\\ntell me   will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his\\nsorrow when he is seen by his equals   or when he is alone  \\n\\nit will make a great difference whether he is seen or not  \\n\\nwhen he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things\\nwhich he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthere is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist   as\\nwell as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his\\nsorrow  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nbut when a man is drawn in two opposite directions   to and from the\\nsame object   this   as we affirm   necessarily implies two distinct\\nprinciples in him  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\none of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law  \\n\\nhow do you mean  \\n\\nthe law would say that to be patient under suffering is best   and that\\nwe should not give way to impatience   as there is no knowing whether\\nsuch things are good or evil   and nothing is gained by impatience  \\nalso   because no human thing is of serious importance   and grief stands\\nin the way of that which at the moment is most required  \\n\\nwhat is most required   he asked  \\n\\nthat we should take counsel about what has happened   and when the dice\\nhave been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best  \\nnot   like children who have had a fall   keeping hold of the part struck\\nand wasting time in setting up a howl   but always accustoming the soul\\nforthwith to apply a remedy   raising up that which is sickly and\\nfallen   banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art  \\n\\nyes   he said   that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune  \\n\\nyes   i said   and the higher principle is ready to follow this\\nsuggestion of reason  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nand the other principle   which inclines us to recollection of our\\ntroubles and to lamentation   and can never have enough of them   we may\\ncall irrational   useless   and cowardly  \\n\\nindeed   we may  \\n\\nand does not the latter—i mean the rebellious principle—furnish a great\\nvariety of materials for imitation   whereas the wise and calm\\ntemperament   being always nearly equable   is not easy to imitate or to\\nappreciate when imitated   especially at a public festival when a\\npromiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre   for the feeling\\nrepresented is one to which they are strangers  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nthen the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature\\nmade   nor is his art intended   to please or to affect the rational\\nprinciple in the soul   but he will prefer the passionate and fitful\\ntemper   which is easily imitated  \\n\\nclearly  \\n\\nand now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the\\npainter   for he is like him in two ways   first   inasmuch as his\\ncreations have an inferior degree of truth—in this   i say   he is like\\nhim   and he is also like him in being concerned with an inferior part\\nof the soul   and therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him\\ninto a well  ordered state   because he awakens and nourishes and\\nstrengthens the feelings and impairs the reason   as in a city when the\\nevil are permitted to have authority and the good are put out of the\\nway   so in the soul of man   as we maintain   the imitative poet implants\\nan evil constitution   for he indulges the irrational nature which has\\nno discernment of greater and less   but thinks the same thing at one\\ntime great and at another small—he is a manufacturer of images and is\\nvery far removed from the truth  \\n\\nexactly  \\n\\nbut we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our\\naccusation  —the power which poetry has of harming even the good   and\\nthere are very few who are not harmed     is surely an awful thing  \\n\\nyes   certainly   if the effect is what you say  \\n\\nhear and judge   the best of us   as i conceive   when we listen to a\\npassage of homer   or one of the tragedians   in which he represents some\\npitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration   or\\nweeping   and smiting his breast—the best of us   you know   delight in\\ngiving way to sympathy   and are in raptures at the excellence of the\\npoet who stirs our feelings most  \\n\\nyes   of course i know  \\n\\nbut when any sorrow of our own happens to us   then you may observe that\\nwe pride ourselves on the opposite quality—we would fain be quiet and\\npatient   this is the manly part   and the other which delighted us in\\nthe recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman  \\n\\nvery true   he said  \\n\\nnow can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that\\nwhich any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own\\nperson  \\n\\nno   he said   that is certainly not reasonable  \\n\\nnay   i said   quite reasonable from one point of view  \\n\\nwhat point of view  \\n\\nif you consider   i said   that when in misfortune we feel a natural\\nhunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation   and\\nthat this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is\\nsatisfied and delighted by the poets  —the better nature in each of us  \\nnot having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit   allows the\\nsympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is another  s   and\\nthe spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in\\npraising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good man he\\nis   and making a fuss about his troubles   he thinks that the pleasure\\nis a gain   and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem\\ntoo   few persons ever reflect   as i should imagine   that from the evil\\nof other men something of evil is communicated to themselves   and so\\nthe feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the\\nmisfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own  \\n\\nhow very true  \\n\\nand does not the same hold also of the ridiculous   there are jests\\nwhich you would be ashamed to make yourself   and yet on the comic\\nstage   or indeed in private   when you hear them   you are greatly amused\\nby them   and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness  —the case\\nof pity is repeated  —there is a principle in human nature which is\\ndisposed to raise a laugh   and this which you once restrained by\\nreason   because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon   is now let\\nout again   and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre  \\nyou are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet\\nat home  \\n\\nquite true   he said  \\n\\nand the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other\\naffections   of desire and pain and pleasure   which are held to be\\ninseparable from every action—in all of them poetry feeds and waters\\nthe passions instead of drying them up   she lets them rule   although\\nthey ought to be controlled   if mankind are ever to increase in\\nhappiness and virtue  \\n\\ni cannot deny it  \\n\\ntherefore   glaucon   i said   whenever you meet with any of the eulogists\\nof homer declaring that he has been the educator of hellas   and that he\\nis profitable for education and for the ordering of human things   and\\nthat you should take him up again and again and get to know him and\\nregulate your whole life according to him   we may love and honour those\\nwho say these things—they are excellent people   as far as their lights\\nextend   and we are ready to acknowledge that homer is the greatest of\\npoets and first of tragedy writers   but we must remain firm in our\\nconviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the\\nonly poetry which ought to be admitted into our state   for if you go\\nbeyond this and allow the honeyed muse to enter   either in epic or\\nlyric verse   not law and the reason of mankind   which by common consent\\nhave ever been deemed best   but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in\\nour state  \\n\\nthat is most true   he said  \\n\\nand now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry   let this our\\ndefence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in\\nsending away out of our state an art having the tendencies which we\\nhave described   for reason constrained us   but that she may not impute\\nto us any harshness or want of politeness   let us tell her that there\\nis an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry   of which there are\\nmany proofs   such as the saying of   the yelping hound howling at her\\nlord     or of one   mighty in the vain talk of fools     and   the mob of\\nsages circumventing zeus     and the   subtle thinkers who are beggars\\nafter all     and there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity\\nbetween them   notwithstanding this   let us assure our sweet friend and\\nthe sister arts of imitation   that if she will only prove her title to\\nexist in a well  ordered state we shall be delighted to receive her—we\\nare very conscious of her charms   but we may not on that account betray\\nthe truth   i dare say   glaucon   that you are as much charmed by her as\\ni am   especially when she appears in homer  \\n\\nyes   indeed   i am greatly charmed  \\n\\nshall i propose   then   that she be allowed to return from exile   but\\nupon this condition only—that she make a defence of herself in lyrical\\nor some other metre  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nand we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of\\npoetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her\\nbehalf   let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to\\nstates and to human life   and we will listen in a kindly spirit   for if\\nthis can be proved we shall surely be the gainers—i mean   if there is a\\nuse in poetry as well as a delight  \\n\\ncertainly   he said   we shall be the gainers  \\n\\nif her defence fails   then   my dear friend   like other persons who are\\nenamoured of something   but put a restraint upon themselves when they\\nthink their desires are opposed to their interests   so too must we\\nafter the manner of lovers give her up   though not without a struggle  \\nwe too are inspired by that love of poetry which the education of noble\\nstates has implanted in us   and therefore we would have her appear at\\nher best and truest   but so long as she is unable to make good her\\ndefence   this argument of ours shall be a charm to us   which we will\\nrepeat to ourselves while we listen to her strains   that we may not\\nfall away into the childish love of her which captivates the many   at\\nall events we are well aware that poetry being such as we have\\ndescribed is not to be regarded seriously as attaining to the truth  \\nand he who listens to her   fearing for the safety of the city which is\\nwithin him   should be on his guard against her seductions and make our\\nwords his law  \\n\\nyes   he said   i quite agree with you  \\n\\nyes   i said   my dear glaucon   for great is the issue at stake   greater\\nthan appears   whether a man is to be good or bad   and what will any one\\nbe profited if under the influence of honour or money or power   aye   or\\nunder the excitement of poetry   he neglect justice and virtue  \\n\\nyes   he said   i have been convinced by the argument   as i believe that\\nany one else would have been  \\n\\nand yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards\\nwhich await virtue  \\n\\nwhat   are there any greater still   if there are   they must be of an\\ninconceivable greatness  \\n\\nwhy   i said   what was ever great in a short time   the whole period of\\nthree score years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison\\nwith eternity  \\n\\nsay rather   nothing     he replied  \\n\\nand should an immortal being seriously think of this little space\\nrather than of the whole  \\n\\nof the whole   certainly   but why do you ask  \\n\\nare you not aware   i said   that the soul of man is immortal and\\nimperishable  \\n\\nhe looked at me in astonishment   and said   no   by heaven   and are you\\nreally prepared to maintain this  \\n\\nyes   i said   i ought to be   and you too—there is no difficulty in\\nproving it  \\n\\ni see a great difficulty   but i should like to hear you state this\\nargument of which you make so light  \\n\\nlisten then  \\n\\ni am attending  \\n\\nthere is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil  \\n\\nyes   he replied  \\n\\nwould you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying\\nelement is the evil   and the saving and improving element the good  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nand you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil   as\\nophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body   as\\nmildew is of corn   and rot of timber   or rust of copper and iron   in\\neverything   or in almost everything   there is an inherent evil and\\ndisease  \\n\\nyes   he said  \\n\\nand anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil   and\\nat last wholly dissolves and dies  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nthe vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of each  \\nand if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will   for\\ngood certainly will not destroy them   nor again   that which is neither\\ngood nor evil  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nif   then   we find any nature which having this inherent corruption\\ncannot be dissolved or destroyed   we may be certain that of such a\\nnature there is no destruction  \\n\\nthat may be assumed  \\n\\nwell   i said   and is there no evil which corrupts the soul  \\n\\nyes   he said   there are all the evils which we were just now passing in\\nreview   unrighteousness   intemperance   cowardice   ignorance  \\n\\nbut does any of these dissolve or destroy her  —and here do not let us\\nfall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man   when\\nhe is detected   perishes through his own injustice   which is an evil of\\nthe soul   take the analogy of the body   the evil of the body is a\\ndisease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body   and all the\\nthings of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through\\ntheir own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so\\ndestroying them   is not this true  \\n\\nyes  \\n\\nconsider the soul in like manner   does the injustice or other evil\\nwhich exists in the soul waste and consume her   do they by attaching to\\nthe soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death   and so\\nseparate her from the body  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nand yet   i said   it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish\\nfrom without through affection of external evil which could not be\\ndestroyed from within by a corruption of its own  \\n\\nit is   he replied  \\n\\nconsider   i said   glaucon   that even the badness of food   whether\\nstaleness   decomposition   or any other bad quality   when confined to\\nthe actual food   is not supposed to destroy the body   although   if the\\nbadness of food communicates corruption to the body   then we should say\\nthat the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself   which is\\ndisease   brought on by this   but that the body   being one thing   can be\\ndestroyed by the badness of food   which is another   and which does not\\nengender any natural infection—this we shall absolutely deny  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand   on the same principle   unless some bodily evil can produce an evil\\nof the soul   we must not suppose that the soul   which is one thing   can\\nbe dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another  \\n\\nyes   he said   there is reason in that  \\n\\neither   then   let us refute this conclusion   or   while it remains\\nunrefuted   let us never say that fever   or any other disease   or the\\nknife put to the throat   or even the cutting up of the whole body into\\nthe minutest pieces   can destroy the soul   until she herself is proved\\nto become more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things\\nbeing done to the body   but that the soul   or anything else if not\\ndestroyed by an internal evil   can be destroyed by an external one   is\\nnot to be affirmed by any man  \\n\\nand surely   he replied   no one will ever prove that the souls of men\\nbecome more unjust in consequence of death  \\n\\nbut if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the soul\\nboldly denies this   and says that the dying do really become more evil\\nand unrighteous   then   if the speaker is right   i suppose that\\ninjustice   like disease   must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust   and\\nthat those who take this disorder die by the natural inherent power of\\ndestruction which evil has   and which kills them sooner or later   but\\nin quite another way from that in which   at present   the wicked receive\\ndeath at the hands of others as the penalty of their deeds  \\n\\nnay   he said   in that case injustice   if fatal to the unjust   will not\\nbe so very terrible to him   for he will be delivered from evil   but i\\nrather suspect the opposite to be the truth   and that injustice which  \\nif it have the power   will murder others   keeps the murderer alive—aye  \\nand well awake too   so far removed is her dwelling  place from being a\\nhouse of death  \\n\\ntrue   i said   if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is\\nunable to kill or destroy her   hardly will that which is appointed to\\nbe the destruction of some other body   destroy a soul or anything else\\nexcept that of which it was appointed to be the destruction  \\n\\nyes   that can hardly be  \\n\\nbut the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil   whether inherent or\\nexternal   must exist for ever   and if existing for ever   must be\\nimmortal  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nthat is the conclusion   i said   and   if a true conclusion   then the\\nsouls must always be the same   for if none be destroyed they will not\\ndiminish in number   neither will they increase   for the increase of the\\nimmortal natures must come from something mortal   and all things would\\nthus end in immortality  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nbut this we cannot believe—reason will not allow us—any more than we\\ncan believe the soul   in her truest nature   to be full of variety and\\ndifference and dissimilarity  \\n\\nwhat do you mean   he said  \\n\\nthe soul   i said   being   as is now proven   immortal   must be the\\nfairest of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements  \\n\\ncertainly not  \\n\\nher immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument   and there are\\nmany other proofs   but to see her as she really is   not as we now\\nbehold her   marred by communion with the body and other miseries   you\\nmust contemplate her with the eye of reason   in her original purity  \\nand then her beauty will be revealed   and justice and injustice and all\\nthe things which we have described will be manifested more clearly  \\nthus far   we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at\\npresent   but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a\\ncondition which may be compared to that of the sea  god glaucus   whose\\noriginal image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are\\nbroken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways  \\nand incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and\\nstones   so that he is more like some monster than he is to his own\\nnatural form   and the soul which we behold is in a similar condition  \\ndisfigured by ten thousand ills   but not there   glaucon   not there must\\nwe look  \\n\\nwhere then  \\n\\nat her love of wisdom   let us see whom she affects   and what society\\nand converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal\\nand eternal and divine   also how different she would become if wholly\\nfollowing this superior principle   and borne by a divine impulse out of\\nthe ocean in which she now is   and disengaged from the stones and\\nshells and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up\\naround her because she feeds upon earth   and is overgrown by the good\\nthings of this life as they are termed   then you would see her as she\\nis   and know whether she have one shape only or many   or what her\\nnature is   of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this\\npresent life i think that we have now said enough  \\n\\ntrue   he replied  \\n\\nand thus   i said   we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument   we\\nhave not introduced the rewards and glories of justice   which   as you\\nwere saying   are to be found in homer and hesiod   but justice in her\\nown nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature  \\nlet a man do what is just   whether he have the ring of gyges or not  \\nand even if in addition to the ring of gyges he put on the helmet of\\nhades  \\n\\nvery true  \\n\\nand now   glaucon   there will be no harm in further enumerating how many\\nand how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues\\nprocure to the soul from gods and men   both in life and after death  \\n\\ncertainly not   he said  \\n\\nwill you repay me   then   what you borrowed in the argument  \\n\\nwhat did i borrow  \\n\\nthe assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust\\njust   for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case\\ncould not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men   still this\\nadmission ought to be made for the sake of the argument   in order that\\npure justice might be weighed against pure injustice   do you remember  \\n\\ni should be much to blame if i had forgotten  \\n\\nthen   as the cause is decided   i demand on behalf of justice that the\\nestimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we\\nacknowledge to be her due should now be restored to her by us   since\\nshe has been shown to confer reality   and not to deceive those who\\ntruly possess her   let what has been taken from her be given back   that\\nso she may win that palm of appearance which is hers also   and which\\nshe gives to her own  \\n\\nthe demand   he said   is just  \\n\\nin the first place   i said—and this is the first thing which you will\\nhave to give back—the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known\\nto the gods  \\n\\ngranted  \\n\\nand if they are both known to them   one must be the friend and the\\nother the enemy of the gods   as we admitted from the beginning  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all\\nthings at their best   excepting only such evil as is the necessary\\nconsequence of former sins  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nthen this must be our notion of the just man   that even when he is in\\npoverty or sickness   or any other seeming misfortune   all things will\\nin the end work together for good to him in life and death   for the\\ngods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be\\nlike god   as far as man can attain the divine likeness   by the pursuit\\nof virtue  \\n\\nyes   he said   if he is like god he will surely not be neglected by him  \\n\\nand of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed  \\n\\ncertainly  \\n\\nsuch   then   are the palms of victory which the gods give the just  \\n\\nthat is my conviction  \\n\\nand what do they receive of men   look at things as they really are   and\\nyou will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners   who run\\nwell from the starting  place to the goal but not back again from the\\ngoal   they go off at a great pace   but in the end only look foolish  \\nslinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders   and without\\na crown   but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the prize\\nand is crowned   and this is the way with the just   he who endures to\\nthe end of every action and occasion of his entire life has a good\\nreport and carries off the prize which men have to bestow  \\n\\ntrue  \\n\\nand now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which you\\nwere attributing to the fortunate unjust   i shall say of them   what you\\nwere saying of the others   that as they grow older   they become rulers\\nin their own city if they care to be   they marry whom they like and\\ngive in marriage to whom they will   all that you said of the others i\\nnow say of these   and   on the other hand   of the unjust i say that the\\ngreater number   even though they escape in their youth   are found out\\nat last and look foolish at the end of their course   and when they come\\nto be old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen   they\\nare beaten and then come those things unfit for ears polite   as you\\ntruly term them   they will be racked and have their eyes burned out   as\\nyou were saying   and you may suppose that i have repeated the remainder\\nof your tale of horrors   but will you let me assume   without reciting\\nthem   that these things are true  \\n\\ncertainly   he said   what you say is true  \\n\\nthese   then   are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed\\nupon the just by gods and men in this present life   in addition to the\\nother good things which justice of herself provides  \\n\\nyes   he said   and they are fair and lasting  \\n\\nand yet   i said   all these are as nothing either in number or greatness\\nin comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and\\nunjust after death   and you ought to hear them   and then both just and\\nunjust will have received from us a full payment of the debt which the\\nargument owes to them  \\n\\nspeak   he said   there are few things which i would more gladly hear  \\n\\nwell   i said   i will tell you a tale   not one of the tales which\\nodysseus tells to the hero alcinous   yet this too is a tale of a hero  \\ner the son of armenius   a pamphylian by birth   he was slain in battle  \\nand ten days afterwards   when the bodies of the dead were taken up\\nalready in a state of corruption   his body was found unaffected by\\ndecay   and carried away home to be buried   and on the twelfth day   as\\nhe was lying on the funeral pile   he returned to life and told them\\nwhat he had seen in the other world   he said that when his soul left\\nthe body he went on a journey with a great company   and that they came\\nto a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth  \\nthey were near together   and over against them were two other openings\\nin the heaven above   in the intermediate space there were judges\\nseated   who commanded the just   after they had given judgment on them\\nand had bound their sentences in front of them   to ascend by the\\nheavenly way on the right hand   and in like manner the unjust were\\nbidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand   these also\\nbore the symbols of their deeds   but fastened on their backs   he drew\\nnear   and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry\\nthe report of the other world to men   and they bade him hear and see\\nall that was to be heard and seen in that place   then he beheld and saw\\non one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth\\nwhen sentence had been given on them   and at the two other openings\\nother souls   some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with\\ntravel   some descending out of heaven clean and bright   and arriving\\never and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey   and they\\nwent forth with gladness into the meadow   where they encamped as at a\\nfestival   and those who knew one another embraced and conversed   the\\nsouls which came from earth curiously enquiring about the things above  \\nand the souls which came from heaven about the things beneath   and they\\ntold one another of what had happened by the way   those from below\\nweeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of the things which they had\\nendured and seen in their journey beneath the earth   now the journey\\nlasted a thousand years     while those from above were describing\\nheavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty   the story  \\nglaucon   would take too long to tell   but the sum was this  —he said\\nthat for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered\\ntenfold   or once in a hundred years—such being reckoned to be the\\nlength of man  s life   and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a\\nthousand years   if   for example   there were any who had been the cause\\nof many deaths   or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies   or been\\nguilty of any other evil behaviour   for each and all of their offences\\nthey received punishment ten times over   and the rewards of beneficence\\nand justice and holiness were in the same proportion   i need hardly\\nrepeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon as\\nthey were born   of piety and impiety to gods and parents   and of\\nmurderers   there were retributions other and greater far which he\\ndescribed   he mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits\\nasked another     where is ardiaeus the great       now this ardiaeus lived\\na thousand years before the time of er   he had been the tyrant of some\\ncity of pamphylia   and had murdered his aged father and his elder\\nbrother   and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes    \\nthe answer of the other spirit was     he comes not hither and will never\\ncome   and this     said he     was one of the dreadful sights which we\\nourselves witnessed   we were at the mouth of the cavern   and   having\\ncompleted all our experiences   were about to reascend   when of a sudden\\nardiaeus appeared and several others   most of whom were tyrants   and\\nthere were also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been\\ngreat criminals   they were just   as they fancied   about to return into\\nthe upper world   but the mouth   instead of admitting them   gave a roar  \\nwhenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had not been\\nsufficiently punished tried to ascend   and then wild men of fiery\\naspect   who were standing by and heard the sound   seized and carried\\nthem off   and ardiaeus and others they bound head and foot and hand  \\nand threw them down and flayed them with scourges   and dragged them\\nalong the road at the side   carding them on thorns like wool   and\\ndeclaring to the passers  by what were their crimes   and that they were\\nbeing taken away to be cast into hell     and of all the many terrors\\nwhich they had endured   he said that there was none like the terror\\nwhich each of them felt at that moment   lest they should hear the\\nvoice   and when there was silence   one by one they ascended with\\nexceeding joy   these   said er   were the penalties and retributions   and\\nthere were blessings as great  \\n\\nnow when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days  \\non the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey   and   on\\nthe fourth day after   he said that they came to a place where they\\ncould see from above a line of light   straight as a column   extending\\nright through the whole heaven and through the earth   in colour\\nresembling the rainbow   only brighter and purer   another day  s journey\\nbrought them to the place   and there   in the midst of the light   they\\nsaw the ends of the chains of heaven let down from above   for this\\nlight is the belt of heaven   and holds together the circle of the\\nuniverse   like the under  girders of a trireme   from these ends is\\nextended the spindle of necessity   on which all the revolutions turn  \\nthe shaft and hook of this spindle are made of steel   and the whorl is\\nmade partly of steel and also partly of other materials   now the whorl\\nis in form like the whorl used on earth   and the description of it\\nimplied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped\\nout   and into this is fitted another lesser one   and another   and\\nanother   and four others   making eight in all   like vessels which fit\\ninto one another   the whorls show their edges on the upper side   and on\\ntheir lower side all together form one continuous whorl   this is\\npierced by the spindle   which is driven home through the centre of the\\neighth   the first and outermost whorl has the rim broadest   and the\\nseven inner whorls are narrower   in the following proportions—the sixth\\nis next to the first in size   the fourth next to the sixth   then comes\\nthe eighth   the seventh is fifth   the fifth is sixth   the third is\\nseventh   last and eighth comes the second   the largest   or fixed stars  \\nis spangled   and the seventh   or sun   is brightest   the eighth   or\\nmoon   coloured by the reflected light of the seventh   the second and\\nfifth   saturn and mercury   are in colour like one another   and yellower\\nthan the preceding   the third   venus   has the whitest light   the fourth\\n  mars   is reddish   the sixth   jupiter   is in whiteness second   now the\\nwhole spindle has the same motion   but   as the whole revolves in one\\ndirection   the seven inner circles move slowly in the other   and of\\nthese the swiftest is the eighth   next in swiftness are the seventh  \\nsixth   and fifth   which move together   third in swiftness appeared to\\nmove according to the law of this reversed motion the fourth   the third\\nappeared fourth and the second fifth   the spindle turns on the knees of\\nnecessity   and on the upper surface of each circle is a siren   who goes\\nround with them   hymning a single tone or note   the eight together form\\none harmony   and round about   at equal intervals   there is another\\nband   three in number   each sitting upon her throne   these are the\\nfates   daughters of necessity   who are clothed in white robes and have\\nchaplets upon their heads   lachesis and clotho and atropos   who\\naccompany with their voices the harmony of the sirens—lachesis singing\\nof the past   clotho of the present   atropos of the future   clotho from\\ntime to time assisting with a touch of her right hand the revolution of\\nthe outer circle of the whorl or spindle   and atropos with her left\\nhand touching and guiding the inner ones   and lachesis laying hold of\\neither in turn   first with one hand and then with the other  \\n\\nwhen er and the spirits arrived   their duty was to go at once to\\nlachesis   but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in\\norder   then he took from the knees of lachesis lots and samples of\\nlives   and having mounted a high pulpit   spoke as follows     hear the\\nword of lachesis   the daughter of necessity   mortal souls   behold a new\\ncycle of life and mortality   your genius will not be allotted to you  \\nbut you will choose your genius   and let him who draws the first lot\\nhave the first choice   and the life which he chooses shall be his\\ndestiny   virtue is free   and as a man honours or dishonours her he will\\nhave more or less of her   the responsibility is with the chooser—god is\\njustified     when the interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots\\nindifferently among them all   and each of them took up the lot which\\nfell near him   all but er himself   he was not allowed     and each as he\\ntook his lot perceived the number which he had obtained   then the\\ninterpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives   and\\nthere were many more lives than the souls present   and they were of all\\nsorts   there were lives of every animal and of man in every condition  \\nand there were tyrannies among them   some lasting out the tyrant  s\\nlife   others which broke off in the middle and came to an end in\\npoverty and exile and beggary   and there were lives of famous men   some\\nwho were famous for their form and beauty as well as for their strength\\nand success in games   or   again   for their birth and the qualities of\\ntheir ancestors   and some who were the reverse of famous for the\\nopposite qualities   and of women likewise   there was not   however   any\\ndefinite character in them   because the soul   when choosing a new life  \\nmust of necessity become different   but there was every other quality  \\nand the all mingled with one another   and also with elements of wealth\\nand poverty   and disease and health   and there were mean states also  \\nand here   my dear glaucon   is the supreme peril of our human state   and\\ntherefore the utmost care should be taken   let each one of us leave\\nevery other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one thing only   if\\nperadventure he may be able to learn and may find some one who will\\nmake him able to learn and discern between good and evil   and so to\\nchoose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity   he\\nshould consider the bearing of all these things which have been\\nmentioned severally and collectively upon virtue   he should know what\\nthe effect of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a\\nparticular soul   and what are the good and evil consequences of noble\\nand humble birth   of private and public station   of strength and\\nweakness   of cleverness and dullness   and of all the natural and\\nacquired gifts of the soul   and the operation of them when conjoined  \\nhe will then look at the nature of the soul   and from the consideration\\nof all these qualities he will be able to determine which is the better\\nand which is the worse   and so he will choose   giving the name of evil\\nto the life which will make his soul more unjust   and good to the life\\nwhich will make his soul more just   all else he will disregard   for we\\nhave seen and know that this is the best choice both in life and after\\ndeath   a man must take with him into the world below an adamantine\\nfaith in truth and right   that there too he may be undazzled by the\\ndesire of wealth or the other allurements of evil   lest   coming upon\\ntyrannies and similar villainies   he do irremediable wrongs to others\\nand suffer yet worse himself   but let him know how to choose the mean\\nand avoid the extremes on either side   as far as possible   not only in\\nthis life but in all that which is to come   for this is the way of\\nhappiness  \\n\\nand according to the report of the messenger from the other world this\\nwas what the prophet said at the time     even for the last comer   if he\\nchooses wisely and will live diligently   there is appointed a happy and\\nnot undesirable existence   let not him who chooses first be careless  \\nand let not the last despair     and when he had spoken   he who had the\\nfirst choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny  \\nhis mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality   he had not\\nthought out the whole matter before he chose   and did not at first\\nsight perceive that he was fated   among other evils   to devour his own\\nchildren   but when he had time to reflect   and saw what was in the lot  \\nhe began to beat his breast and lament over his choice   forgetting the\\nproclamation of the prophet   for   instead of throwing the blame of his\\nmisfortune on himself   he accused chance and the gods   and everything\\nrather than himself   now he was one of those who came from heaven   and\\nin a former life had dwelt in a well  ordered state   but his virtue was\\na matter of habit only   and he had no philosophy   and it was true of\\nothers who were similarly overtaken   that the greater number of them\\ncame from heaven and therefore they had never been schooled by trial  \\nwhereas the pilgrims who came from earth having themselves suffered and\\nseen others suffer   were not in a hurry to choose   and owing to this\\ninexperience of theirs   and also because the lot was a chance   many of\\nthe souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an evil for a good  \\nfor if a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated himself\\nfrom the first to sound philosophy   and had been moderately fortunate\\nin the number of the lot   he might   as the messenger reported   be happy\\nhere   and also his journey to another life and return to this   instead\\nof being rough and underground   would be smooth and heavenly   most\\ncurious   he said   was the spectacle—sad and laughable and strange   for\\nthe choice of the souls was in most cases based on their experience of\\na previous life   there he saw the soul which had once been orpheus\\nchoosing the life of a swan out of enmity to the race of women   hating\\nto be born of a woman because they had been his murderers   he beheld\\nalso the soul of thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale   birds   on\\nthe other hand   like the swan and other musicians   wanting to be men  \\nthe soul which obtained the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion   and\\nthis was the soul of ajax the son of telamon   who would not be a man  \\nremembering the injustice which was done him in the judgment about the\\narms   the next was agamemnon   who took the life of an eagle   because  \\nlike ajax   he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings   about the\\nmiddle came the lot of atalanta   she   seeing the great fame of an\\nathlete   was unable to resist the temptation   and after her there\\nfollowed the soul of epeus the son of panopeus passing into the nature\\nof a woman cunning in the arts   and far away among the last who chose  \\nthe soul of the jester thersites was putting on the form of a monkey  \\nthere came also the soul of odysseus having yet to make a choice   and\\nhis lot happened to be the last of them all   now the recollection of\\nformer toils had disenchanted him of ambition   and he went about for a\\nconsiderable time in search of the life of a private man who had no\\ncares   he had some difficulty in finding this   which was lying about\\nand had been neglected by everybody else   and when he saw it   he said\\nthat he would have done the same had his lot been first instead of\\nlast   and that he was delighted to have it   and not only did men pass\\ninto animals   but i must also mention that there were animals tame and\\nwild who changed into one another and into corresponding human\\nnatures—the good into the gentle and the evil into the savage   in all\\nsorts of combinations  \\n\\nall the souls had now chosen their lives   and they went in the order of\\ntheir choice to lachesis   who sent with them the genius whom they had\\nseverally chosen   to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller\\nof the choice   this genius led the souls first to clotho   and drew them\\nwithin the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand   thus\\nratifying the destiny of each   and then   when they were fastened to\\nthis   carried them to atropos   who spun the threads and made them\\nirreversible   whence without turning round they passed beneath the\\nthrone of necessity   and when they had all passed   they marched on in a\\nscorching heat to the plain of forgetfulness   which was a barren waste\\ndestitute of trees and verdure   and then towards evening they encamped\\nby the river of unmindfulness   whose water no vessel can hold   of this\\nthey were all obliged to drink a certain quantity   and those who were\\nnot saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary   and each one as he\\ndrank forgot all things   now after they had gone to rest   about the\\nmiddle of the night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake   and then\\nin an instant they were driven upwards in all manner of ways to their\\nbirth   like stars shooting   he himself was hindered from drinking the\\nwater   but in what manner or by what means he returned to the body he\\ncould not say   only   in the morning   awaking suddenly   he found himself\\nlying on the pyre  \\n\\nand thus   glaucon   the tale has been saved and has not perished   and\\nwill save us if we are obedient to the word spoken   and we shall pass\\nsafely over the river of forgetfulness and our soul will not be\\ndefiled   wherefore my counsel is   that we hold fast ever to the\\nheavenly way and follow after justice and virtue always   considering\\nthat the soul is immortal and able to endure every sort of good and\\nevery sort of evil   thus shall we live dear to one another and to the\\ngods   both while remaining here and when   like conquerors in the games\\nwho go round to gather gifts   we receive our reward   and it shall be\\nwell with us both in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand\\nyears which we have been describing  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       end of the project gutenberg ebook the republic       \\n\\nupdated editions will replace the previous
